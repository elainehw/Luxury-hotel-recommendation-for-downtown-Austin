5,Excellent Annual Conference as Always at Westin Domain,I attend an annual conference each year in January at the Westin Domain. Time after time the staff goes above and beyond to accommodate all our requests. The hotel is located in the trendy Domain area of Austin. You can literally park your car and walk to all sorts of shopping and dining. Top Golf is less than a mile if you have extra time for some leisure! Will be back!!
2,Meh...,1. Room was not cleaned and we were staying 2 nights2. Valet parking is expensive and unwieldy when streets are closed by the hotel3. Found red and green stains (bio) on comforter which was grossWill not be returning.
3,OK stay. Much better options in Austin,The lobby music is way too loud that you can’t hear the reception staff and they can’t hear you. You can’t have a conversation and have to go outside to talk. This was at 10pm Sunday and 8am Monday. The WiFi is poor and intermittent. When you ask staff they shrug shoulders and say “yeah we get that a lot”. I normally stay at JW Marriott it Aloft and they are much better.
5,Girls trip,Roslyn at the rooftop bar was awesome! She took care of our group all night. It made the beautiful city view that much better. Can’t wait to return for another trip with friends to try out more of the city.
3,Too many vagrants,I understand that it is not the Westin’s fault but it’s the city of Austin and the state of Texas that bears responsibility for this. Maybe they should invest some money into fixing the social safety net. If this is what a red state is I am glad I pay state taxes.
4,Great Hotel in Austin,"We had a great stay at the Westin Austin Downtown. The location was ideal for all of our sightseeing, eating and drinking, with most places we wanted to visit within a 20 minute walk.The staff (led by Isabelle Russell and Jaylin) provided great service during our entire visit, including a nice recognition of our 1 year wedding anniversary, and always had helpful recommendations to share. The gym was fairly typical for a hotel gym, with a good selection of cardio equipment, as well as some free weights and machines, as well as TRX cables.We would definitely stay here again."
5,"Awesome, Caring Staff!!!","We encountered such caring and accommodating people at the Weston Austin Downtown Hotel. We arrived at the hotel with our tiny Chihuahua just after learning that she was dying from kidney failure. Everyone from the Valet to the front desk to the restaurant was so kind, helpful, and accommodating that it made a terrible situation so much easier. Adrian (the host in the restaurant) even went so far as to place a postcard expressing sympathy under our door. Morgan and Murphy at the check in counter were also extremely kind, helpful, and accommodating. The room was nice and room service was prompt and kind. There were others that I wish I knew their names, but all in all the staff was amazing!"
5,Fantastic staff,"Isa, one of the evening staffs, was absolutely welcoming and made my stay very eventful. The hotel was clean and in a perfect location. The room was very comfortable and clean. Close to all of the events."
5,Austin in November,Great Location. Great Service. All staff helpful and friendly! Check-in and check-out fast and easy.Any request was handled quickly and effieciently.One evening I asked a staff member for a recommendation for dinner. It was a great great choice!
5,"Way to go, Westin!!!","Great place to stay!! Appreciate you taking such good care of us! Clean rooms, kind staff, great food, fabulous location, the view from the rooftop bar and pool was amazing too. Made our time in Austin wonderful."
5,"Excellent service, style and location!","Hotel staff was incredibly nice and accommodating, rooms and hotel exceptionally clean, rooftop bar had stunning views and great drinks! I Will definitely stay again! Hotel restaurant fantastic as well!"
5,Good stay,"Everything is EXCELLENT, I stayed the third time in Westin Austin and everytime it was a realy good living in there. The service is allways excellent in ervery way. It is allways good to come back to Westin."
5,F1 Race weekend,"We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. Everyone was extremely helpful, and polite and courteous. The restaurant was exceptional. I used the fitness facility, audit is well equipped.We had breakfast in the restaurant and my only complaint was In had to ask for peanut butter and jam. This should be on the tables. When I requested these items, I would only get one jar of jam and one pod of peanut butter. Why so stingy?"
4,Great location but...,The location is great. Just steps from 6th and blocks from Congress. The rooms were nice but need some attention to detail. Shower had mildew and the box spring had massive stain (ala murder scene). Great continental breakfast for Bonvoy members. Great servers at Stella!!! Azul at pool deck was awesome.
4,Some problems,"to people who are not hearing impaired, this seems like a small problem. Unfortunately, I am hearing impaired. The closed captioning on the tv wouldn't work except for about 10 minutes on one day.The other problem had to do with the security of the room. This was one of the rooms with two doors. When I awoke after the first night, the second door (not the main entrance to the room) was unlocked. It must have been unlocked all night or was unlocked during the night by someone. Management apologized, but when that happens you don't sleep very soundly thinking that someone might come back in the middle of the night."
5,The Westin Austin will not disappoint!,"My brief stay at the Westin in Austin was perfect. Employees were kind and helpful, amenities were fantastic, suite was comfortable and quiet, rooftop pool bar was inviting. I will consider the Westin on future travels."
3,Disappointed,We are lifetime Titanium members with Marriott Bonvoy and this is the second time we've stayed at the Westin Downtown. Both times have been disappointing... They do not pay attention to guest requests (hypoallergenic room) and their housekeeping was terrible. They forgot to clean our room one of the days. Their housekeeping and front desk managers apologized but never did anything to resolve the issues.
5,Wedding,"This Westin Hotel had a professionalism that was unparalleled!!! The staff made you feel like family. Above and beyond anything I have ever experienced! I had a unusualdilemma that happened to me on Saturday , Oct 19th of this year. I'd like to mention some names that need to be mentioned. At the Spa, Symphony and Victoria were amazing associates! Fernando Hernandez was helpful with my dilemma. SimplyXO Events had 2 ladies that were on top of the wedding party, making sure everyone's needs were met, and making sure the band members had things to eat at the green room across the hall. Their names were Caroline L.and Maddie H."
2,Frustrating experience,"Westin is always a great option. Not this time. Room was not properly clean, not even during the stay and per request. Staff would knock on the door early in the morning for info they have on system and packages where only delivered after many many many requests.One of my top 2 worst hotel experiences in life."
5,NTMA Conference - stay,"Really great experience! Amazing staff, very personable and detailed approach to their customers. I felt like they really cared for everyone they interacted with and really went above and beyond for this loya member. The staff truly makes the experience, and you should be very proud of the group you have working for you at this location. I usually don't leave a review, but had to make sure that they receive recognition for their hard work and dedication in exceeding all expectations. I will be back, and the best experience I have had yet form all my Marriott travels over the years. GIVE THEM A RAISE! Thanks again for everything, gold star review!"
5,Great Place with Great Staff,"I especially want to Thank Pilar. We arrived a little early to check in, after a long day of traveling. We were close to losing our patience 2 hours later, but Pilar handled it professionally and with compassion and got us into our requested corner King room. Then she later sent a gift to our room to thank us for our patience. Thank you again Pilar."
5,Westin Austin Downtown,"Be aware that valet parking is $49 per night. It will get you a 10% discount at breakfast, but I am not sure that it is a good trade off. The menu in the restaurant is typically Austin semi-healthy, ""let me throw some kale on that for you"" type food.But they have not ruined the hamburger yet, very good."
5,Westin staff went above and beyond!,"Can’t say enough about how accommodating the Westin staff was after we had to quickly vacate an undesirable Airbnb. Exhausted from searching for a hotel, we checked in at 11 pm, when Phoebe at front desk had two rooms available and offered to comp our parking however long we stayed.The next day we extended our stay and added another room for more family. We had to switch rooms, but Juliana reduced the price on each room about $150 each. And this despite it was ACL weekend and hotels were full!Westin met our every need with courtesy, professionalism and genuine concern for our well being. In each interaction, theywent above and beyond. We thank Westin staff for helping us turn around our Austin trip after a house rental gone bad. Our Westin choice made all the difference."
5,Nice hotel in a great spot,"I really enjoyed my stay here at the Westin. It is located pretty close to all the downtown restaurants and bars. We were greeted very warmly. They recognized my hotel status and provided an upgraded room. They did request that I signed a policy that was basically committing that I will not throw a party in my room. I understand that ACL was happening at the same time you need to remind people you are serious but at the same time, I am lifetime platinum and spent way over 700 nights with your properties. If you can't trust me staying a weekend in your room ACL or no ACL we probably have bigger problems as you don't trust your most loyal guests. Rant over.The rooms are bright and airy. The decor is modern but gives you a cozy welcoming feel. The floor to ceiling window makes it feel open. The room was very clean. The bed is extremely comfortable and I had really great nights of sleep. One of the biggest pluses is the number of outlets that are available. One on each side of the bed (important as I charge my phone overnight and it is also my alarm). One at the desk and two additional throughout the room. You are also able to make a green choice and not have your room cleaned. In exchange for giving up cleaning, you receive either $5 for hotel food/snacks or 500 points. This is a really nice option.We had breakfast each morning at the restaurant adjoining the hotel. It was really good and the service was excellent.I was able to squeeze in some time at the pool. It has a very nice view of the city. Chairs are not hard to come by and towels are plentiful. Since it was in the mid-90s, I was really happy to see that the pool was cooled so it was a refreshing dip rather than a warm bath. The pool bar is also really great. A good variety of beverages and food options with prompt service.We were granted a 4pm late checkout. This was a really nice option made available because of my status. Since our flight was at 5:30pm, we took it. I had two people knock on the door asking if we checked out. This was extremely annoying as I was on conference calls both times. They just keep knocking and don't give you an opportunity to answer the door until you open it. I think they need to revisit their late checkout approach.Overall, I would definitely choose to stay here again. Small errors but overall a really great experience."
5,What a place to stay,"Great location near 6th and perfect places to walk to. Morgan and Isabel at the front desk are of the best to make the stay enjoyable. Breakfast is classic southern hospitality and size wise, pick wisely."
5,Wonderful Stay!,"My girlfriends and I stayed at the Westin Austin from Thursday to Sunday. The facilities were clean, our room was great, and the people were wonderful, kind, and super helpful! Definitely would stay there again!"
4,Very good,"A quality property, very clean, comfortable and friendly. I'd like to thank Axl and Tyler L. for offering to put a microwave in my room when I was complaining about not having a way to heat up my leftovers at the restaurant, and it was there before I got back from dinner! My only complaint is there was no anti-slip covering on the floor of the shower, it would be very easy to slip. And there was no place inside the shower to hang a washcloth and let it drip dry."
5,First Time Austin,First time Austin or Texas for that matter. Westin was 5 Stars all around. Check in staff fantastic. Valet guys outstanding. Rooftop bar and pool extra bonus. Hotel in middle of everything. Location gets busy on weekends but to be expected. 5 Star’s
5,Austin for a week long conference,I have stayed here each of the last three years that I have attended an annual conference in Austin. The service is consistently superior with welcoming front desk staff and exceptionally clean rooms.
3,Room Cleanliness Not What I Was Expecting,"My wife and I checked-in on Thurs, Sep 26 for a 1 night stay due to the location to a conference the following day. This was my first time at this property as I normally stay at the JW Marriott since it has a Concierge Lounge. We arrived in the room and noticed two very apparent stains on the surface of the cloth chair in the room. I called the front desk to have it exchanged for a clean one. Afterward that, we noticed that the comforter had two stains of what appeared to be makeup and my wife was not wearing any, nor had either of us touched the bed yet. I notified the front desk and a Manager named Isobel offered her apologies, and later that evening a Manager named Adeline apologized again. The next morning, as I entered the shower for its first use since our time being in the room I noticed brunette hair along the shower wall. At that point, I did not even bother with reporting it to the front desk. We finished getting dressed and departed the room.Jason Stevens, Titanium Elite Rewards Member #832 974 984"
5,Most fantastic experience!,"We didn’t stay in the hotel, but we did experience the most amazing service at the pool’s cocktail lounge. Brittany, and Trevor were two of the most amazing individuals. They catered to every customers need, from water to drinks everyone was staying hydrated. I definitely encourage anyone visiting Austin to check out this quaint pool in the sky!"
5,Excellent meeting and property.,"Had a small team meeting in Austin. The Austin Westin was a great pick. The rooms were clean, well appointed and up-to-date. The lobby restaurant and bar were well staffed and service was excellent. The rooftop bar got crowded at night but there were lounge chairs for sitting and great views of the city.The meeting room was a great size and the lighting, temperatures, etc were excellent. Everything was ready before we got there. The lunch (beef brisket, beans, etc) was fantastic – everyone commented on the quality of the food. For snacks we had chips and cookies one day and brownies the next – both were outstanding. We did order coffee at the last minute on day #2 and that took some time to arrive but otherwise great F&B.I met with Angela Hung and Monica Griffin on site who were attentive and responsive to every request. Monica gave a safety brief at the beginning of our meeting and it was clear that safety is a focus on the property.The hotel is in a great location with easy walks to 6th street, the Congress bridge and just about everything else.I highly recommend this property."
5,EXCELLENT STAY!!!!!,"What a wonderful place to stay! Super conveniently located, superb room, stunning views of downtown and the BEST staff I've had the pleasure of conversing with. Everything was top notch. No detail was overlooked."
5,Westin 9/2019,The service was great. The staff was always smiling and asking if we needed anything ! Stella San Jax for breakfast was perfect and it’s just steps from your room. Fitness gym well equipped but thePeloton bike in the fitness gym was not well maintained. Would definitely stay here again if I’m going to stay downtown.
1,"Amazing hotel, worst sleep ever","I had high expectations for the hotel and was not disappointed upon arrival. The location was perfect and the hotel was clean and modern. The staff were very friendly as well. Unlike most hotels, the restaurant downstairs was hip and popular—I booked both dinner and breakfast reservations for the high-rated restaurant. The gym and pool area were very well maintained and great places to spend some time. Dinner at Stella was really good, especially the bone marrow appetizer; and the waiter was so nice and attentive. As a mom of 2 young kids, this getaway was meant to be time for some R&R (my first solo trip in 5 years!). A gym session and dinner was a good start. HOWEVER, that abruptly ended when I tried to turn in early for the night to get some uninterrupted sleep, which is what I looked forward to the MOST for this trip. I was put in a room on the 5th floor.... from 10p-2a, I was unable to sleep from the blaring music on the street. When I tried to cover my had with pillows, it just made the bass vibrations rumble louder in my ears. It was pure torture!!!! There were 20 floors in this hotel. I had checked in early too.. and was put only 5 steps from sleep hell. I ended up having to cancel my breakfast reservations and pick up a quick coffee to drink as I checked out to catch my flight back home. I mentioned the loud night to the front desk at check out and the only response I received was, “we’re so sorry... next time, if you call us, we can try to switch rooms for you.” Obviously, switching rooms, at midnight, in your pajamas, with your things unpacked is hardly ideal. No other recourse for me, whose main purpose of the trip was to get some rest was completely obliterated. So, overall, loved the hotel but absolutely hated the stay overall. The front desk could’ve at least comped my $3 coffee to caffeinate this sleep-deprived guest. Had the sleep situation had not been horrendous, I would’ve given this hotel 5 stars across the board."
1,Terrible Front Desk Staff- Unable to get into my room!,"I had to travel for work from out of town for 4 nights this past week. I normally travel to Austin every quarter of the year for work and personal reasons. Never had an issue with the Westin until now. I had issues accessing my room every time I tried. The electronic key wasn't working. I repeatedly went down to the front desk at different times throughout the day for help. Most times I ended up waiting outside my room door for an ""engineer"" to help me get into my room at least 40 minutes at a time. The engineer would change the battery and yes the door would work at that moment but hours later I would have the same problem. This was extremely inconvenient as I had appointments and meetings to get to at different times. This continued to happen throughout my stay. The last day I had enough after waiting 50 minutes outside my door, calling the front desk 3 times. Went down and asked for the Manager. I explained the situation to Pilar Villeneuve (Front desk manager). She didn't try to explain why this was happening and just kept saying she would comp my stay however since it was a work trip the charge has already gone through. Only thing she could do is give me a new key card. Sadly I will not be returning to this hotel. My company who had over 50 people staying at this hotel the same week will also be told about this."
5,Comfortable and Clean,"We stayed for 3 nights here for a quick getaway. It is in the middle of downtown, which is nice as it is close to everything. I feel like housekeeping went above and beyond, organizing the room while we were away. Abraham was a great server in the restaurant, and his local knowledge was super helpful!"
5,Great spot in the city,"I loved the vibe at the Westin. The pool on the roof was especially amazing, perfect for a dip in the hot Austin weather. It’s perfectly situated in the center near everything. I had a nice view on the 12th floor and the gym was well equipped too."
5,Hotel with all your needs,"Went to austin over summer with a couple buddies and stayed here. This hotel is one of a kind, everything was pristine and we had a good time at the pool. Got drunk at the pool and the manager gave us some tips and places to go get our party on. Overall a hell of a time"
5,Great Location,"Hotel is great location right in the heart of Austin. Super clean, friendly and right around great venues and food stops. Also has great views from the rooms. The rooftop bar and pool was really fun to hang out at. I would definitely come back here."
5,BD SSM19 - Beck,"My experience at the Westin was amazing! The hotel and all common areas were clean and welcoming. The rooms were spotless and the bed was absolutely fabulous! The employees encountered were friendly and helpful. Last but not least, the food was spectacular! I will definitely refer my friends/family/colleagues to stay at the Westin Austin Downtown. Thank you for an amazing stay!"
5,Perfection!,"Food, professionalism, cleanliness, atmosphere and value was all a hit. I was there for 4 Days on business with Audi Of America. We were looked after very well. Will be returning to this Hotel for sure!"
5,A Terrific Experience,"I stayed here to enjoy my AMEX gift and the overall experience was perfect. Great and helpful staff, very nice and functional lobby with adjoining restaurant - lively and classy was the first impression. The room was upscale and as clean as can be with services all above board. Thus is your classic Westin with service meets 21st century Austin. It’s the best Westin I have stayed in - period!"
4,Great Downtown location,"Downtown Austin right across the street from the famed Antone's Nightclub. Clean well appointed lobby, but a little small by most Westin standards. Rooms spacious but not extraordinary. Valet Parking on site $49 a night. So unless you truly need a car, it is easy to walk to most downtown Austin venues and multiple restaurants. Fast and efficient check-in and check-out. Does have nice rooftop bar."
4,Great Location!!,"This location is in the heart of Downtown Austin. Rooftop pool was nice, but a bit small. Wait staff in the pool area were awesome. Very attentive with several guests using the pool. Lobby bar was nice and comfortable."
5,Downtown Gem!!!,"Beautiful and new property. Excellent Service. Close to everything! Pool deck/ Bar was amazing! The views!!!!! Was a great experience and will definitely return. Close to campus, Capital, and 6th Street"
5,Great Location / Super Clean Rooms,Great location for most everything that makes Austin. The room was spotless and well-stocked with amenities and each day the housekeeper re-stocked and cleaned the room spotlessly. The only downside was the service in the restaurant on the Saturday of Texas football game. The restaurant was sorely understaffed. Our food server did a pretty good job but it appeared she was working 10+ tables and one cannot provide good service being stretched that far. Surprisingly we had the same server on Sunday and was provided excellent service as the restaurant was less busy. Staff was very friendly and our room was ready when we arrived early. Overall a good stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at The Westin Austin Downtown again.
1,Told on arrival the didnt hve a room an couldnt tell me when one might be available,"After driving for 3.5 hours to this htel with a reservation we made an confirm we check in via the mobile app - we were a go big game day onyl to arrive to a we dont have a room for you now nor can we tell you when we might - Now I ask would you write I would hope so - the other hotel which I stay arounbf the corn - knew me I called them they (JW Marriott) who is owned my the same parent company told me to come on over they had a room i could have immediately so we did - they had my room ready on arrival as promise - Choose wiselty the JW Marriott is a much better run Hotel , they treat there guest right"
5,Happy Downtown Austin Location,"We were happy to be able to find a location close to the action in Austin. It is close to the 6th Street scene, and other downtown attractions. The rooms are beautiful, the restaurant is excellent, and the staff is friendly and efficient."
4,1st timer In Austin Texas,I really loved Austin over all best stay with a great view. Very sweet people and amazing pool on the roof with a must see views check out my photos on Instagram @intl.gem everything was convenient. Valet was great also very fast with just a text message. Over all this stay made it an epic experience.
5,A Stellar Stay!,This is a great hotel! The perfect location within easy walking distance of all the great Austin bars and restaurants. The amazing staff went above and beyond in having chilled champagne waiting in our room in advance of our arrival for an anniversary getaway. The rooftop pool and bar was great. And valet service was prompt and professional. A fantastic hotel experience. We’ll be back.
5,clean and good service,"this hotel has a very good gym facility, rooftop pool with amazing view. Also, hotel located within walking distance to all city attractions and a short drive to Austin airport. Furthermore, hotel provides good quality toiletries."
5,Perfect for walking!,If you’re looking for a hotel where you won’t need to use Uber this is for you. Everything is within walking distance. Also I forgot some toiletries and was provided with them from the front desk. The staff is trained highly in hospitality.
5,Great location and loved the hotel,"Really great hotel, loved the location and the look and fell of the place. Very upscale look, My room was on the 16 floor, Cool view of 6th and the town. Very friendly staff. Will be back for sure. 6th street right next store."
5,Great experience,"Westin Austin is a really nice and classy place to stay at. It is in the middle of Rainy's and 6th street which is the go to place in that area. They have an extremely tasty biscuit for breakfast, it is a must try! Great roof deck also!"
5,Westin DT Austin,"Great location - always meets my 'Westin' standards and what I'm accustomed to. Only negative was the pool. We went the last week of August and it was very, very crowed. The pool could have been easily 3 times the size. Was hoping to lay by the pool read a book and relax. Instead it was a party with loud music and drunk people. But the hotel and staff were great."
5,Great Westin experience in terrific location,"The Westin Austin Downtown delivers an experience that is consistent with what you would expect from all other Westins. Focus on the customer, comfortable rooms and a well-equipped fitness center. Food and service at Stella Bar were both very good. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Convenient location. My only complaint is that there is no Club Lounge at the Westin Austin Downtown. Which is a shame, because this property has everything else going for it."
5,Beautiful hotel and rooftop pool!,"We had a king suite room on the 17th floor. The Azul rooftop pool had awesome views and the service was great! Lots of great restaurants around within walking distance. Great customer service, I would definitely stay again!"
5,Stella San Jac - stellar service and top-notch server!,"Delightful services, quality food, and a great environment.I had such an amazing experience. Our server, Britney Query, made my visit one of the best I've had in a long time. She was attentive, paid attention to details, following up with recommendations. Because she knew her dishes she was able to recommend some amazing dishes, I felt as though I was experiencing a five-star restaurant. She's going places! I recommend Stella San Jac to anyone wanting a stellar experience, friendly and classy environment. I will be bringing my business associates here more frequently. Thank you!"
5,Love the pool,"What a wonderful hotel in downtown Austin. Morgan was very healthy with our check-in, she handled our requests. Valet is very good and it's worth using it. I definitely like the idea that I had to text for my car to be brought out.Loved the view."
3,Easy location 5th street,"Clean, great shower and very comfortable beds! Valet parking is a little crazy, right on street, no ramp. Valet is $49/night. Housekeeping was nonexistent as we signed up for eco something. Essentially we reused our towels for 3days. No sheet changes. Despite phone reminder to service our room, only trash was emptied? The desk provided compensation at checkout. We really appreciated the air conditioning, as it was 101 most days. Having Stella’s restaurant in the hotel was appreciated and delicious. Wonderful service and fast. Moderately priced."
5,Great Location,I had never been to Austin and the Westin was great. Juliana checked us in and was so pleasant and professional it made a great start to our trip. I travel a lot and have never encountered a staff that was so friendly.
5,Westin ATX,Beautiful hotel in a great location. Has a nice bar and restaurant. Valet staff were very nice and provided water when you were leaving the hotel. There is also a staff member who greets you when you walk into the hotel.
5,Excellent!,"I had an excellent experience. The room was immaculate, housekeeping did a fantastic job and at the end of a hot day, the room was cool and clean. I was texted by staff to make sure everything was to my liking and it was! I will be staying at the Westin Austin Downtown again! Thanks for a great stay!"
5,My new favorite hotel in Austin,"This was my first time at the Westin in Austin and I was impressed. Beautiful hotel, I loved my room. It was super clean with the best soft towels and bedding and perfect air conditioning. And pin drop quiet! On the second night of my stay I got some noisy neighbors but I made a call to the front desk and within minutes they took care of the problem. Not a peep for the rest of the evening. I really appreciated that second night of great sleep! Very professional staff and also really nice."
5,I literally live here,"I have essentially been living here for the past three months while out on a work assignment and could not be more pleased with my experience. The entire staff here has been so welcoming and helpful throughout my stay that it has prompted me to continue to extend my stay in favor of moving into an apartment. The location, amenities, gym, rooftop pool, and restaurant are nothing short of amazing. To top things off, the housekeeping staff is so accommodating and pleasant to interact with that I can't imagine being loyal to any other hotel in town. Highly recommend staying here."
4,Downtown delight,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel in June.The staff are all super helpful and very friendly. Check in was informative and quick, and my room was big and very clean.There was building work going on beside the hotel and I like the way they had acknowledged this with the earplugs and note on the pillows - I didn't need the earplugs- even though the work was on my side of the hotel as I didn't hear anything.The hotel has all the usual miniatures in the large shower, plenty of big, fluffy towels, hairdryer, bathrobe, room safe etc.The pool on the top floor is very popular and was busy most nights - especially at the weekend, but it was really nice to come back and sit in it after a day in the hot sunshine. They had live music every night and the musicians were really excellent.There is a well appointed gym at this hotel which was busy in the mornings, but it is well worth going up to watch the sunrise over the city from one of the treadmills.I stayed here for a week in June when travelling for work, but it is one of those rare hotels that I would return to with family. There was a relaxed feel about the hotel, with a large open foyer area and a good mix of clientele."
5,Beautiful pool and super attentive staff.,"I visited the Westin for pleasure with a friend, it did not disappoint. The interior was beautiful and the location was perfect for a short Austin experience. There’s live music all around and plenty of restaurants within walking distance, super convenient. The staff was attentive and approachable and truly enhanced our time!The rooftop pool was our favorite part. Loved the bar and views of downtown/hill country."
1,Aftermath of stay(valet and handbags),"Scratches on drivers side door after picking up SUV from valet. Valet company denying they did it. Claims person has pretty much shut me out. I take really good care of my vehicles and I know where every scratch is on my SUV(there aren’t many). The scratches were not there prior to my arrival. And ...of all places the scratches are on my drivers side door. The only door they would have used. Hmmmmm... 2nd...,my girlfriend left two small hand bags in the room. One was empty and the other had her car remote, keys and personal info. When we got home she immediately called the hotel to check and see if the items were left behind(22 Jul). She was told they were and that she would have to pay S&H. She did as they asked. So...a week goes by and she still hadn’t received the items. She called on the 29th and was told they had just been shipped. So we skip to Friday(Aug 2)evening. My girlfriend starts getting emails and a text from a stranger asking questions about where we lived. This person was waiting on a suit that her husband had left at the hotel and got my gf’s purses instead. . After speaking to the lady who had to go through my girlfriend’s purse to get her info. We decided we would go and pick up the handbags in person. Luckily the handbags fell into a good persons hands. Imagine if they didn’t? My girlfriend is s single mom and a crook could have had the keys to her home, office, car and other personal info. From the valet to this incident Westin & the valet co. have totally been unprofessional. We are totally disappointed and will not be staying at any Westin’s In the future!! There are a lot of other hotels in the Austin downtown area. I would think long and hard before staying at the Westin downtown Austin. We will be pursuing this matter to the next level. We are good, honest hard working people who want nothing for free. This is about people paying attention to detail and handling situations in a professional manner."
4,Nice property with a BIG pool scene!,"We do a lot of travel and this property met our expectations. The staff was really wonderful and super-friendly. EVERY team member from valet to desk to bartenders and waitresses made us feel welcome and appreciated for our patronage, which exceeded our expectations.The elevators were a bit irritating but apparently the property needs to be strict with elevator access because the rooftop bar and pool are really, really popular with locals. The pool seemed like a normal sort of hotel pool on Tuesday and Wednesday but as the weekend approached, the action REALLY increased. By Saturday, the pool was as busy as any nightclub you might visit! Difficult to find a place to even sit down but the young sexy crowd was a feast for the eyes. ;)Valet parking was super pricey at $50 per night but we needed a vehicle during our stay (helping our daughter move). If you don't absolutely need a car, I'd recommend avoiding bringing a car.There's lots of construction in the area and the hotel offers earplugs but we honestly didn't hear any noise (though we were on the 18th floor). We actually enjoyed watching the cranes and construction and look forward to seeing how the work has progressed and changed the Austin skyline the next time we visit.Nice hotel bar and restaurant with exceptionally friendly staff."
5,Great downtown hotel,Very nice hotel in the business center of Austin. We were able to walk to great restaurants and to the convention center as well. The room was very modern and clean. Needed extra towels and house keeping was helpful and fast.
5,Another Great Visit,"Recently spent a long afternoon at the Westin’s rooftop pool Azul, and i enjoy it more each time. The view from the pool is amazing, while the atmosphere and drinks are on the same page! As always the staff is very attentive and there to help with any needs. Always looking forward to going back!"
5,Beautiful hotel and excellent service,"This is not our first stay at the Westin Downtown. Love everything about this place. The bedding is very comfortable, the showers have rain heads and the customer service is excellent. During this stay, we had an issue with the air conditioning as it was not cooling room properly. Within 10 minutes of calling front desk, 2 repairmen came to our room to trouble shoot. They determined it was the thermostat and offered to either have front desk change our room or they would replace. Isabella, the front desk manager assisted us in finding a room similar to the one we were previously in. She was extremely helpful and patient, and truly wanted us to be comfortable. The repairmen were also helpful and professional."
4,Westin Downtonw Austin Visit,"The facility is nice and one staff member stands out. The Front Office Manager, Juliana Meda, is the best! She is friendly, happy, enthusiastic and engages with the customer. She handled a bad situation where we couldn't find anyone at the Valet to get my car. She is reason for the rating I gave the hotel is 4 out of 5. Without her it would have been a 2. Juliana is a 5!The restaurant staff is not service oriented at all."
5,Great Location,We celebrated our 23rd wedding anniversary and the hotel staff Made is feel welcomed and special. From the front desk to the restaurant staff! We will be back again. Great location in the heart of downtown Austin
4,Location,Friendly staff. Open and nicely decorated lobby. Bar / Restaurant had good selection and open till midnight on Sat. Decent size room and never waited too long for elevator on busy Saturday. Nice shower and bathroom had good space. One block from 6th street so a lot of younger adults at hotel enjoying the proximity to the action. The pool is for the young adults too I hate to say. If you have kids not a good spot for kids at the pool. Think of Vegas day pool party. Valet is also challenging due to lack of space in front of hotel.
4,Nephews 21st,Hotel was nice and the staff was really amazing. They provided us some nice complimentary drink tickets to the bar. Checked in and as a lifetime titanium elite member my upgrade or room was not available. I placed the request in my bonvoy app for early check in. Got a room looking at a roof top. Rooms were clean and nice. Pool was super crowded on 20 floor. Had a nice stay. Hotel is right around the corner from all the fun on 6th street. Check our Eureka Burgers for a beer and burger and get a voodoo sugar rush at voodoo doughnuts.
4,Great location!,"I would highly recommend the Westin Downtown! The hotel is located 1 block away from Austin’s famous 6th Street, tucked into a quiet block seconds away.The hotel boasts a rooftop pool, which we greatly enjoyed. The rooms are clean, and good sized, just a bit dated in decor. The lobby looks more like that of a boutique hotel than a large chain hotel. The staff is friendly and answers all questions. I would have liked to see a full time Concierge, as this was our first time in Austin, and we had logistical as well as recommendation based questions.All in all though, a wonderful stay. I would definitely return to the Westin my next trip to Austin."
5,Very nice hotel in a central location,"We stayed here for 2 nights and overall were very happy with our stay.The staff were very welcoming upon arrival and were happy to answer any questions we had throughout our stay. Our room was spacious, nicely decorated and very clean. The best feature of the hotel is the rooftop pool which was great to relax in each day.The hotel is well located and very close to 6th street. We had no issues with sound coming from 6th street and slept well both nights.The only disappointing part of our stay was the price of the car parking at $49 per night. This seemed a little excessive."
4,Comfey Room and Bed,"The room was vey clean and the bed was extremely comfortable!!! Great location. Within walking distance of wonderful restaurants and bars. The rooftop pool was fantastic. There seems to be an issue with the plumbing system throughout the hotel, but other than that, it was great."
5,Westin Excellence,I loved the food & swimming pool. I also loved the live music scene across the street. I needed a boot shine & was directed across the street to Antone’s bar where I was able to get a quality boot shine as well. I was also able to order flowers as well as chocolates for my wife through the hotel concierge. The hotel concierge also got me a free pass to golf at Barton Creek Country Club over the weekend.
5,Westin was wonderful!,"Out refrigerator was warm, but it was switched out immediately! Anything we inquired about was done quickly and with a smile. Great service!!I also enjoyed working out in the fitness center on the 20th floor. Towels, water, apples, even earphones were provided! Very nice. The fitness center is usually my pet peeve, but this one was nice and clean!"
5,Great Staff & Customer service,"What a nice and pleasant surprise to find such great customer service in a very busy hotel, room was great, staff very attentive, brunches were very tasty, overall an excellent stay.The gym and the roof top pool were fantastic!!Amenities just like Westin, no disappointment at all!Keep up the great staff!"
5,First Time as Westin Austin,Great hotel and location. Staff was great and I look forward to returning with my Family. I had both lunch and dinner at you hotel and both were excellent. I would suggest putting in some misting systems for the Roof Top bar tenders.
5,Nice location and hotel,"Second time staying here in two years.Love the Azul pool on 20 th floor.Rooms are very nice, clean, quiet and comfortable.Parking at $49 per day a little steep.Service is impeccable from checkin,Lots of bachelor and bachelorette parties started arriving on Thursday night so lots of people checking in and in the restaurant and bar areas."
3,Nice hotel,The property is nice. Upon arrival friendly staff and when checked into the room found lots of hair in sink and bathroom shower. Front desk was quick to move me into another room only to find out later that evening that I was next to the bars on the street and could hear the music all night. They do offer earplugs as a remedy.
5,Very nice,"Good location, good service, quiet, clean. Quick check in and check out. Bed very comfy. Close to good restaurants and walking areas. Nice view from the roof. Would recommend and would return if returned."
5,Night with grandkids,Staff was outstanding. Went out of the way to make my grandkids feel welcome and have a great time. Pool and bar on the top of the hotel is a wonderful amenity. Honored my request for an early check in.
5,Excellent,"The on-site restaurant and bar was also great. I rated my sleep quality as ‘average’ but it had nothing to do with the hotel (which was quiet). I was there for 3 nights, would definitely stay again. Recommend."
5,Excellent hotel & service and food even better,Check in was a breeze. Our suite was great with excellent views. Very spacious. The restaurant food in the evening was fantastic and even better the following morning. All staff were very friendly and the restaurant staff were second to none.
1,Very disappointed in this property,"My husband is a titanium elite Marriott rewards member and we stay at marriotts all over the US. With that being said, this was by the far the worst Marriott we have been in. Our toilet was not functional for 2 days and the maintenance people had to come and “fix” it on 3 separate occasions. The bedding was stained, etc. I could go on and on. The pool was tiny-it is very much a lounging pool. Not kid friendly at all. We will never return to thiis hotel, it is a disgrace to the Marriott brand."
4,clean location and central to most attractions,"stayed here on a business trip. parking on site is fast and costs about $25 a night. This location has a trendy entrance with bar. The check in fast is very friendly and accommodates various requests. We didn't like the smell in our room and they promptly changed us to another location. The beds were comfortable and the hallway and adjacent rooms do not carry noise. The bathroom and room is spacious for 2 people. In addition, this location has various restaurants within walking distance. There is alot of homeless people in the downtown area, but they did bother people. You can walk to the capitol building within minutes."
5,Wonderful Stay at th Westin Austin,The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. I would definitely book this hotel any time I find myself in Austin again. The staff greeted almost every guest that walked in the door and was very helpful throughout my stay.
4,Above Average Stay,"I experienced several avoidable issues this stay, including a lack of follow-through on my mobile check in requests and a malfunctioning AC unit, but the staff worked hard to address them adequately. I’ll probably return to the property if the price is reasonable."
5,Great hitel,Another great hotel in the Marriott / Westin chain. Downtown is the middle if everything. Park and walk to mist restaurants and cocktail lounges or entertainment venues.The hotel goes out of their way to be sure guests and comfortable and enjoying their stay. Great staff of dedicated people that care.
4,Austin 4th July Visit,Visited Austin on 4th and 5th July. Stayed at the Westin on my Marriott points.This is the 5th Westin we've stayed at around the world and have generally found them to be good hotels.This hotel unfortunately didn't have an exec lounge with free cocktails from 5-8pm bit they did give us a voucher each for a drink at the bar and breakfast.The hotel isn't quite as plush at the ones in Cape Town and Singapore bit it was pretty good and I'm a great location for walking around Austin.
5,"Great service, nice and accommodating staff","The staff was great. They went above and beyond to handle a few issues that arose. Fantastic rooftop pool area, with pool bar / music at night (at least the light we were there). The location is great too - walkable to much of downtown."
4,A top ATX hotel location,"Great location in downtown ATX. Their restaurants and bar are lively and the staff is great. As a frequent traveler, I get to see a lot of hotels across the country and generally rate them on a couple key criteria:1) Location- this is an A1 location very close to restaurants, bars, and the central business districts of downtown.2) Comfort- Westin is usually a top comfort hotel, but unfortunately, the Austin Westin does not live up to the Westin name. My bed was not the Heavenly Bed Westin is known for; it was rock hard and lumpy.3) Gym- Great gym; they have everything from a Peloton Bike (love it!) to free weights, TRX, and other cardio equipment all on the top floor overlooking downtown and UT.4) Bar/Restaurant- I was in on a Thursday night so maybe not the typical, but it was jumping. Seemed to be a lot of locals grabbing a bite/drink... good crowd of people.Overall, I recommend the hotel, but bring your Tylenol PM to help compensate for the poor beds."
2,Meh...,"My husband and I came to Austin for a long weekend. We chose this hotel for the location and it was slightly more economical than the JW.First off, just a heads up on Austin itself...they have a major problem with a homeless population. Wow. The city is full, I mean, FULL of homeless drug addicts that pester you repeatedly for lose change. We spoke with two police officers who spent the early morning hours (think 0700) trying to rouse these folks up on the street and benches and doorways. Apparently city council voted to abolish laws that prevent this population from sleeping in the streets in popular, tourist and local areas....that goes into effect on July1st. Granted, this is not an issue with the hotel, it’s a problem for Austin as a city. It’s a shame, my husband used to travel here frequently for business but hasn’t been here in about 3 years and we are told this started becoming a major problem for the city 3 yrs ago. Just be aware....we have been fortunate that so far they ask for money and move on....but we were followed for a few blocks last night by one and it is scary.As for the hotel, you should know the pool looks significantly different than what you see on the website. It is narrow and not very long. The capacity is 36 people. We counted 47. The rooftop bar is open to the public and it is nearly impossible for hotel guests to get a chair to sit on (we didn’t get one!). We brought coffee up from our room and were told “no outside drinks”.The hotel isn’t horrible, but the pool, it’s rules, the fact that it is open to the public..that was a big disappointment. It’s 98F here today and we are cooling off in our room because the pool is so jam packed & I’d say easily half of those folks came in off the street. They say you have to be a guest to enjoy the pool but they really have no way of knowing.Next time if we come (and that’s a big if because although this city is super fun with artists and music and great food....the homeless problem is a massive turnoff) we will stay at the JW...."
2,ACFE Conference Participant - Adam Goodrum,"Disappointed in the property and surrounding area. The hotel did not have a parking solution without valet at $50 p/day. This is a New York City rate as i live in New Jersey. This was not clarified during booking the ACFE recommended locations and on their site or the hotel site. The hotel site says valet parking but DOES NOT say ""We have no other parking options""!!.This is business travel for me and found the Wifi and network very poor. Unable to use my skype for business and conduct business meetings. Not a location that would support the business traveler.The significant disappointment, the homeless and drug addicts in the area. My wife and I tried to run the Sunday morning and counted 28 addicts around the property. We could see the needles and sores. We quickly returned to the hotel for safety. This is a great disappointment in Austin and downtown as i used to have clients in this area 10 years ago. My team would enjoy themselves on 6th street with clients. today this is not an option and a very scary area.Another disappointment was my wife and i went to the pool and carried a Starbucks coffee from my room. I don't drink to any extent and needed my coffee. The pool security took my coffee and said it was an outside drink. As i just made it in my room and walked upstairs seems silly and confused us. I've never seen a hotel with such odd policies.I will not recommend this property and communicate my experience to the ACFE.As a common user of Westin properties, this is by far one of the most disappointing locations in quality and location."
5,Amy P is best check-in person I’ve ever had at Marriott brand!,"Greatest check in experience just now — welcome, all needs anticipated, and even built-in concierge recommendations!Also only Marriott hotel I’ve ever heard of that lets you use complimentary breakfast for room service with door hanger.Especially given the disaster that the W Austin is (see my other review...), this May just be best business — and fun — Marriott hotel in Austin!"
5,Most Outstanding Hotel Experience in a Long Time,"I am frequent business traveler and generally stay at Marriott Bonvoy properties. The level of service at the Westin Austin Downtown was top notch from the staff at check in to follow up text message from Sabina and Phoebe asking for input to make the trip better and meaning it. The onsite restaurant Stella was good, but level of service from all levels were truly outstanding."
5,Fantastic customer service - great location. Highly Recommend!,"I recently called the hotel and was promptly greeted by Olivia G. from their Front Desk who offered to help with my booking. Olivia displayed tremendousknowledge about the hotel and I was impressed with her expertise. She was proactive and consultative about what I was looking for. It is Marriott employees like Olivia who make us loyal customers that encourage us to come back to Marriott properties from time to time.I decided to make a booking, mainly due to Olivia's helpful nature in which she assisted my family.Overall, my stay was fantastic! This is one of my favorite hotels in all of Texas (I have stayed in a dozen different hotels in the region). From the food, to the service, to the ambience, everything is nearly perfect.The check in process was super easy and the room was clean and modern. During my 3 night stay, everything was great. Checkout went well and I will be staying here again in a few weeks.If you're looking for a place in Austin Downtown to stay that's affordable, clean and convenient, this is the perfect place! It is perfectly located just 1 block from 6th St (so not too noisy) but close enough so you can walk over to grab a bite or a drink.A big THANK YOU to the hotel manager Brandt Tiffany as well for his hospitality and kindness.I highly recommend this property, you will not regret it! Enjoy!"
5,great service,"Recently had the pleasure of staing at your hotel. Overall it shows this is a hotel that cares about its guests through the attentive attention to looking after the customer. I especially want to mention front desk christos. great personality, very engaging and most of all you can see in his interaction he truly enjoys what he is doing and cares about his guests. Again, no doubt in my mind when i return to Austin, that's where i'm staying"
2,Not up to Westin name,"We stayed at many Westin’s throughout the years, this one in Austin is only a couple of years old, so expectations were high.I’m not sure if it has to do with Marriott purchasing Starwood, but boy was this Westin a huge disappointment. Hotel is located on the edge of a somewhat sketchy area. Their rooftop bar and pool is populated with local hipsters that are clearly not hotel guests. The drinks offered at this bar are not same as the ones offered in the lobby bar. For example: Upstairs they offer LaMarca Prosecco for $13 a glass(which is a bad one and can be purchased for $8 a bottle at Walmart). Westin is supposed to be an upscale hotel chain and you would think you would be able to get the same glass of wine that you had downstairs...not the case!Rooms were not up to the Westin name either, if I didn’t know I was at a Westin, I would have thought I was at a Hyatt Place! We spent $279 a night for a room that should have been $199! They also seemed to have done away with their signature “heavenly bed”.Housekeeping services terrible at this hotel. There were 3 people staying in the room and we never had enough towels, the shampoo/conditioner bottles were only enough for one person/one use and they were not replenished. Complete lack of attention by housekeeping, ran out of toilet paper, didn’t replenish plastic cups, etc. They pretty much just replaced towels and pulled sheets back.I would not return."
5,Westin Service at it's finest!,"From the time of check-in with Christiforo (sp?) to having drinks at Azul with Roslyn, the service is what you expect from the Westin. They represent the best of the best! When I come to Austin this will be my go to hotel simply due the great service I received and the great accommodations!"
5,Great hotel in a great location,"Spent a couple of nights in this hotel for business. It’s in a great location with a lot of entertainment and restaurants within a very short walk. The hotel lobby is lively with a nice restaurant. We had breakfast there twice and had great service, quickly and the food was good. The rooms were very clean and modern. Beds were very comfortable! Pool is on the roof and fun. Nice fitness center as well. Overall....not much that could be better!"
4,6th Street Noise interferes with sleeping,"This hotel overlooks the dive bars on 6th Street, which are all in 1-2 story buildings. Even if your room is on the 15th story of the hotel and you use the earplugs the hotel provides, you are going to hear the noise from 6th Street. This is a good option if you’re visiting for the 6th Street bars.The rooftop pool and bar are apparently awarding winning and lots of non guests visit but it is very small. There are maybe a dozen lounge chairs, 6 cozy sitting areas, and 6 more tables. The view isn’t that great either.The hotel is clean and lives up to the Westin brand but if you’re not in Austin for 6th Street and want a good night’s sleep, I would suggest staying elsewhere.Platinums get breakfast in the hotel restaurant; any item off of the menu and coffee/tea plus juice."
5,Great location- CLEAN ROOMS,"Although you may have to listen to the music from 6th Street for a few hours at night, it is what is to be expected when you are steps away from one of the best ""music cities"" in the country. Put the ear plugs in if you do not want to enjoy the music but definitely go around the corner the the Blackspace Pizza joint. BEST PIZZA!"
4,Stayed for a bachelorette party,"The bride chose to stay here for her party and it was perfect for eating and bars for downtown. It was nice to be able to walk or scoot to most of our activities and not worry about driving or getting a ride. However, you can only valet which was stupid expensive, the rooftop pool was really neat but crowded, and finally they didn't allow outside drinks (not even water) so purchasing tiny drinks from the bar is your only option. Service desk was very accommodating and we ate at the attached restraunt for breakfast which was convenient. Neat hotel but I wouldn't say it's a five star rating. Nor would I ever go back."
5,End-to-end Awesome Experience,"My family and I stayed at the Westin Downtown Austin last week and had an incredible experience from check-in to checkout. The front desk staff was very helpful during check-in, and provided us with an awesome room location to fit our preferences. The team members on the valet, front desk staff, service during breakfast, rooftop pool were all genuine people who made it feel like our stay was very special. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to experience everything Austin has to offer (the location is awesome- we walked almost everywhere)."
5,Excellent experience,"First time at the Westin in Austin and had a great time. Service was great and location was perfect. Accommodations were oustanding -- will definitely stay again. Top floor pool overlooking parts of the city was very unique -- and very crowded at times, but not unexpected in June."
5,Westin Hotels - always wonderful,"Great location, beautiful rooms, clean great amenities - I love the small, roll on bottle of lavender oil for a relaxing sleep. Roof top bar with lovely views. Somewhat noisy in the evening and limited seating."
4,Really beautiful but...,"The hotel is really beautiful, but there was mold in the shower. There is not an ice machine on every floor. The elevators are annoying to operate. You need to scan the card every time you choose a floor, which is very inefficient. They brag about the pool, which is very neat, but they allow the public to go up to the bar next to it. No one uses the pool and frankly it’s a little intimidating to have a bunch of people sitting around it judging you.I will say that the staff was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly."
5,Stay: 6/6-6/10,Hi Westin! Our whole group wanted to give a shout out to how amazing our entire experience was at the Westin this past weekend. Jeremy was our first encounter after an extremely early flight with tons of luggage. He made us feel instantly accommodated giving us water and letting us have an early check in. I think we cried in excitement because all we wanted to do was sleep! Another person that stood out was a manager I believe. We don't know his name but he always had a smile on his facing asking if we needed anything no matter where he ran into us. We also loved our server in the restaurant both Sunday night/Monday morning - he was so great despite us having a large group of crazy girls! Thank you thank you so much for having such a wonderful staff and building. We will definitely be back!
5,Austin Nights,"Great location downtown. Short walk to all the places of interest. Very clean, quite and comfortable rooms.Hotel staff was very friendly and attentive from the curb, to front desk, to room service.Would stay again without hesitation."
5,Good Place,"Overall the Westin in downtown Austin is a good place to rest your head. Good vibe in the lobby, restaurant is decent and the rooms are clean and quiet. My one complaint is the TV is on satellite and goes out in a rain storm."
5,"Clean, friendly, classy.","They’ve got it right. Can’t go wrong here, whether business, personal, family, etc. convenient to downtown locations, all walkable. Food trucks next door, good eats on property. Get the biscuits! In all seriousness, a great place to stay when visiting Austin."
5,Amazing Stay,I enjoyed my stay and enjoyed all of the amenities and services provided by Westin in Austin. I would highly recommend this to any of my friends/family who are staying in the area and will definitely be returning in the future.
5,Memorial Day Weekend,"Very nice hotel in a great location. Staff were professional, courteous and helpful. The parking rate was a bit steep and will probably keep me from staying at this hotel again. The gym equipment was a little dirtier than I would have expected from a Westin."
5,Great service!,"This hotel is great for couples! The pool especially has an amazing view and the beds were very comfortable. But the best part about it was front desk agent Sabre, she really took great care of us starting from her welcoming smile to the amenity she sent us got our anniversary/graduation/birthday gift! Thank you so much for making this a memorable trip!"
5,Nice hotel!,"We liked this hotel very much. Staff was pleasant, professional, and courteous at all times. Facility is nice, many amenities, and well maintained. The bar and restaurant was great. Be sure to try the biscuits!"
4,Convenient to Downtown Austin,"Enjoyable place to stay on business in downtown Austin. Convenient to restaurants and bars. Breakfast was fine, but like most hotels, rather expensive. The room was quite large and had a good view. Had all of the usual Westin amenities."
5,Great place in Austin,"We enjoyed our comfortable and quiet room on the 19th floor and the nice breakfast at Stella.The location is excellent, within walking distance of restaurants and the action on 6th street.The view from the 20th floor is fantastic."
5,Graduation 👨🏻‍🎓 Gem,"We were visiting for our son’s UT-Austin graduation 🎓, so we had a big group. The staff showed great care from the word go (literally), when we mentioned how much we loved the crab cakes at the in-house restaurant and they gave us a $50 gift certificate. The rooftop pool was amazing and the rooms were immaculate. Yes, the valet parking is expensive but the staff (again) was efficient and helpful. Good showing on a busy weekend."
3,Austin Downtown,Outrageous parking fee. Difficult access to entrance if driving. Bathroom sink backed up. Local residents - lots of them - have access to the pool and they pack it! The bed was not very comfortable. I’m a lifetime Gold Bonvoy member and will not book this property again. Excellent bartender service.
4,Good hotel with slow breakfast service,"Overall excellent hotel but ..As on a busienss trip our team had a tight schedule, weekend service was excellent but during weekdays this become an issue even as there were only a few customers. Some of us just did not have time to finnish the breakfast."
5,1day tour of Austin,Satisfying visit Enjoyable Very helpful staff at front desk .Very good . Clean room I like the location Centrally located Near walking distance to a catholic church . Amenities' are excellentNice reception areaI wish there is complementary light breakfast
5,Britney & Jay at Stella,Britney Q and Jay at Stella knocked it out of the park! Britney was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and drinks and Jay was spot on with quick greets. My intention was to grab a quick bite at the bar and I ended up staying for a bite and two cocktails after I got to chatting with Britney and Jay. Awesome afternoon.
5,Lovely weekend stay for our Anniversary.,Very nice hotel. They really took good care of us and we enjoyed the stay. We got upgraded to a suite with a lovely view of Austin. I will definitely always stay at the Westin.It was our anniversary and they made us feel very special with complimentary champagne and even a cake.Thank you Westin.
5,Fantastic Hotel,Great hotel and amazing staff. Enjoyed the close access to all downtown Austin has to offer. Rooms are up to date and the hotel was always clean. Will definitely stay at Westin when returning to the area.
2,Not the normal Westin experience,"When we arrived in the morning the check in process was abrupt and our room wasn't available which was fine (we did arrive early for a noon check in), however the hotel did not contact us when it was ready. Instead, we had to phone them 2 hours past the reg check in time to be told it was ready and that ‘you should have never expected a phone call, we would text. You probably missed our text because it’s ready’ Our room was a standard Westin room with regular amenities. We did notice that the drapes had vomit and food encrusted on them as we were unpacking. When we contacted the front desk, they assured me that it would be cleaned the following day and that the room service we ordered would be taken care of in compensation for the experience. The next day the room service was barely completed; trash wasn't taken out of the room, the sheets weren’t changed (and no additional points were awarded for opting out of the daily turn down) the duvet cover zipper was broken and hanging fully open and we noticed the cover was actually discoloured blue over a large area. When we checked out, the vomit was never cleaned and the meal that was supposed to be complimentary was still on our bill which was more than disappointing to say the least. This experience was definitely not something that I have come to expect from staying at a Westin. If we go back to Austin, this hotel will definitely not be a one that I would return to."
4,The Westin Austin,"Service from check-in to dining, to valet was outstanding. I will add a special note of thanks to George, Jay, and all the young men in valet parking. The hotel lacks self- parking, and is not in the best part of the city, but the service, as noted, and the value, is there."
5,Worth the Trip,"Service was exceptional from the arrival to the departure. We were greeted with a smile even though it was late hour and made us feel welcome. Not that my Elite Status mattered, I think it's just the way the are."
4,Could have been 5 out of 5 except for Azul Rooftop Pool Set-Up and Staff,"Check-in was fantastic and made us feel welcome.Location of this Westin is terrific. Rooms are clean and nice.Staff at Stella San Jac (lobby-side restaurant) was very good and accommodating.Almost perfect and then,,,If not for our experience at the rooftop bar, Azul, this would be a 5 out of 5 review. After a few days of rain this was a sunny day in Austin and lots of people were heading to the pool - and it was Mother’s Day Weekend. But there weren’t any seats at the rooftop pool except for the completely empty cabanas - that they wanted $500 a piece for them! This isn’t an Oceanside Resort - where does Azul get off trying to charge hotel guests $500 to use a cabana when there isn’t alternative pool seating? We eventually found two seats when we pressed other people there that were holding chairs for no-shows, but the cabanas stayed empty all day. And to be clear, we weren’t looking for a “free cabana”, we just wanted a couple of chairs. Azul shouldn’t be accepting local walk-ins to their pool as a side business if they can’t accommodate paying hotel guests.The Azul staff was lazy and unmotivated to supply service. There were 4 or 5 employees behind the bar talking, laughing, and looking at their phones while customers had to walk to the bar to gets drinks and food all day. We were there for about 4 hours and not once did the staff ever come by to see if we needed more drinks or if our food was alright."
3,May trip to The Westin Austin Downtown,"The hotel is very clean and a nice location! Very walkable to restaurants, attractions, etc.Unfortunately, there was construction going on in or around the hotel that woke us up every morning at 7 a.m. We did call and inform the hotel of this and they acknowledged they were aware of the disruption and offered the option to switch rooms, but we did not want to pack and then unpack again. I am not sure why the hotel put people in lower rooms in the first place if they knew that there was such a disruptive sound that would affect overall experience.Recommend avoiding the restaurant at the hotel. The food wasn't good. Very overpriced and not fresh. Crab cake was cold at dinner. The beet chips were not fresh. The service wasn't great. Ordered a cesar salad at the pool for lunch one of the days and it was just romaine and croutons with cesar dressing. Can't believe they charge $14 for that..."
5,Westin never fails,"I have stayed in Westin properties for many, many years. I have never been disappointed. Always immaculate, comfortable, great service - The Westin beds are the best. Bathroom amenities are excellent. I especially loved the small roll-on bottle of lavender oil for relaxation."
4,A nice modern hotel,"Located downtown , in walking distance to all the shopping and great restaurants. A beautiful roof top pool, a nice restaurant and bar. A very quiet and safe place to be. The staff is good and ready to help in every moment."
5,Awesome hotel!,"Great location downtown, and not far from the airport. Moby was a big help and went above and beyond for our group! His customer service was incredible. Loved the rooftop pool and they even had salsa dancing on Saturday night."
5,"Great hotel, great service","This is a great hotel! Very nice and clean and awesome service. We loved our room and enjoyed the pool and restaurant. The hotel is walking distance or a short ride to plenty of places. Highly recommend, will be back!"
4,"Met Expectations, Solid Business Hotel","I've stayed at this property a handful of times all on business going back to when it originally opened a few years back. My room was in good order for the most part minus a leak in the shower door but not going to hold any ill will towards that. Comfy heavenly bed, walk-in shower, nice view of the city. This hotel has a good gym in my opinion. The gym is located on the top floor alongside the pool outdoor area. My only suggestion as a point of improvement for the hotel is to open the pool bar a little earlier. There was a group of people upstairs at the pool on Friday while I was there all looking to order food or drink. The bar remained closed up until 12pm. Once it opened, rain rolled through and then it shut again. Minus all that, I do think this is a quality hotel option in Austin. Located close to most places you'd wish to go to, solid gym & pool scene, and lastly the Stella Jac restaurant has great food. Try the fried Avocado salad you won't be disappointed!"
3,Not What We Expected,"We were disappointed with the downtown Austin Westin hotel after many stays at Westin prosperities all over the country. After requesting that our room be cleaned every day by stopping by the front desk, we finally got service on our 3rd of 4 nights at the hotel. The wait in the restaurant for breakfast was typically an hour and the wait staff was not friendly and seemed to be put off by having to take our order and wait on us. (Not Jimmy-she was great). My parents requested a handicap accessible room and upon check in were told there were none available. Overall, we never felt like “guests” at the hotel."
5,Long weekend break,"Whilst visiting my friend who is living in Denver temporarily, we booked a weekend break in Austin. The Weston was our choice as we were using our Marriott points and we particularly liked the idea of having a rooftop pool to relax at.Check in was quick and easy. We were on 9th floor and the views over the city were great. We had 2 queen beds and lots of room with a nice spacious bathroom.The rooftop pool is very busy at the weekend but if you’re prepared to sit on chairs and wait for someone to leave you eventually get to lie back on a lounger and relax. The sunsets are lovely and having a drink at the bar watching the sun set is so nice.Breakfast is served in the hotel restaurant where you choose an entree plus 1 hot and 1 cold drink. There’s a wide variety to choose from and lovely healthy juices to enjoy.The location of this hotel is perfect for the surrounding restaurants and bars. It’s dead opposite Eddie V’s and just a few minutes walk from some of the best restaurants we could find like 111 forks and Trulucks. It made for a great stay and I would recommend this hotel."
5,Sabina,"This is a review of Sabina, not the Westin. We came to check in at around 6-7 PM to find out our room (not a special room)was not ready. In all of my travels, I had never heard of a hotel that couldn’t check you in that late in the day. Sabina was very professional and kind while working hard to get us in ASAP. The Westin is lucky to have her."
1,Frustrated.,"I spent $350 for one night here only to learn that the pool is filled with not-hotel guests. So my husband I go up, looking forward to it very much, and there isn’t a single seat. Not one.So be warned, you’re a guest, but the place is swarmed by others and you won’t have access to the amenities you’re paying for. So much for the birthday weekend plans."
5,"Great hotel, location, pool","We spent 2 days in Austin and loved our stay at the Westin. The rooftop pool is amazing, and even though it is small, never seemed crowded. The staff were super friendly. Most of the local attractions were within walking distance: Rainey Street, Lady Bird, Congress Ave, etc. We would definitely stay here again when we return."
5,Easter weekend downtown Austin,"Stayed here Easter weekend to celebrate my wife’s 60th birthday. The room was awesome, the rooftop views are spectacular. Easy access to the Town Lake trail. Tasty breakfast at Stella in the lobby. Very friendly staff."
5,Terrific Visit and Good Value,"Wonderful location with attentive staff. Westin is in the center of everything, and staff really reaches out to guests with strong communications skills. Rooms spacious, clean, and comfortable with usual excellent Westin beds. Only caveat: don't expect to be able to use beautiful rooftop bar and pool as much as you expect to. Though advertised as a guest amenity, availability is uneven. Friday night was perfect, and we enjoyed late-night drinks sitting around a cabana fire pit. Saturday afternoon was a total zoo, with super-crowded conditions due to hotel allowing unlimited use by(and there were MANY) non-guests. We were unable to use the pool or bar at all that afternoon. Saturday night, we discovered that there was a $100 cabana minimum (no such thing the night before), even for hotel guests. There were several empty cabanas. Hotel needs to decide if this area is for hotel guests or not. Note on hotel restaurant: excellent, delicious breakfast; however, service was slow and chaotic. Not a problem for us; convenience was a priority, and we weren't in a hurry. Overall, it was a great stay, despite pool debacle. We would definitely stay there again."
5,Great Hotel,"Located in the heart of Austin, the hotel is a great place to center activities from. Be sure to check out the top floor pool and bar as the scenery is the best in the downtown. The first floor restaurant makes a great Breakfast."
5,Perfect & Relaxing,"Within walking distance to everything; bars, restaurants, sites & museums. All the staff were so nice and helpful. Was there very last minute and they recommended a few places. Hope to comeback and will stay here again."
5,A must when in Austin !,"I spent the afternoon visiting the Westin Downtown. The food in ground floor restaurant Stella San Jac was delicious and the staff was very attentive. Afterwords I ventured to the rooftop bar and pool, Azul. With the combination of stunning views, amazing drinks and awesome bar staff it was a perfect afternoon of listening to music and relaxing. I will definitely be back again!"
1,Not your typical Westin,"I travel a lot (over 50 trips/year) and this is the worst Westin property I have stayed at. The problems start with the lack of any place to unload your luggage from your car except the middle of the street. It’s not safe. It’s inefficient. Our room was not ready until after 5PM. We were supposed to receive a text or call when the room was ready, that never happened.We made the poor decision to host a large dinner party here. The communication with the staff in preparation was terrible. They’re was no reply unless I repeatedly asked for one.The shower in the room was not sealed properly...water was everywhere after every shower.The hotel also failed to mention the construction project going next door. I realize they can not control this, but you need to let your guests know that it will be excessively loud...before you choose to stay there.Lastly, I was double billed for parking every night. They blamed me for driving 2 cars to the hotel....seriously.I would recommend you stay elsewhere in downtown Austin"
5,Great hotel in downtown Austin,"The Westin has a great location; if you are interested in Austin nightlife, the 6th Street scene is 1 block away. The on-site parking is valet. The rooftop pool and bar provide a beautiful view of the Austin skyline."
5,Great location,"We stayed here for four nights while in town for a family wedding. The hotel is very appealing when you walk in and front desk was very friendly. The room was comfortable, quiet and clean. Rooftop pool is nice during the day and bar at night is great place to spend a little time. You are around the block from 6th Street. Location is very desirable."
5,Race weekend,"Everything was wonderful, from the time we arrived to the time we left, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff very friendly. The location was perfect, the roof top pool was total awesome and the lounge in the lobby was great. I highly recommend this hotel."
5,Bachelorette bash of a lifetime,"I could not have a asked for a better experience than the one that I was given at the Westin. The staff was friendly, helpful and detail-oriented. From the moment that we entered the lobby, we felt welcomed. The decor is on point and a gorgeous take on midcentury modern. Love at first sight! Fitting for the Bachelorette party of a lifetime with the best group of ladies!The rooms are spacious and the beds are COMFORTABLE! The views of the downtown cityscape were amazing. The rooftop pool, Azul, was an absolute show stopper! My only wish was that I could've lounged around longer!The assistant GM, Nick, was truly a pleasure and helpful all throughout our stay! Every member of the staff has wonderful tips on exploring the city. The manager at the Stella restaurant gave us some great spots too!This hotel is a MUST in downtown Austin. Location. Friendly staff. Amazing atmosphere!"
5,Wonderful for a Bachelorette weekend in Austin,"As soon as we walked in to the Westin we could not stop talking along pictures of the beautiful walls including famous ATX lights. Rooms were great, clean and showers were amazing. Location even better for our group who ended on Dirty 6th and just walked back only a few blocks. Also, we always felt safe even stumbling back in the early morning hours as security was there to check our room keys before we could come back. Staff went above & beyond for our bride. Autumn the restaurant manager came down, congratulated our bride & gave us all the best tips on what we could do. Stay here if you are ready for a fun weekend with your bride, location could not be better!"
5,Bachelorette,"I arrived to Westin ATX. Came With family and friends, and bride to be, our time was so much fun, we celebrated, enjoyed everything, such a great experience. the food and the service was incredible, Nick was excellent."
5,Wonderful Hotel & Great Staff,"I was here to celebrate my cousins bachelorette party and we wanted stay somewhere a little nicer. The Westin did not disappoint!!! It was in walking distance to some of the nightlife which was very convenient. The hotel is beautiful, the rooftop pool is amazing, and the staff is great too! Management was very accommodating to our requests, and the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful as well. The restaurant/bar had a great food and drink menu too. I will definitely stay here again!!!"
5,Beautiful hotel and AMAZING staff.,We stayed here for a bachelorette party and it was a great experience. The rooms were beautiful and the staff was so attentive and nice to us. The hotel is in a really good location and walking distance from many bars and restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here if you are thinking only coming to Austin!
5,"Incredible stay, beautiful hotel","My friends and I stayed here for my bachelorette party and we had such a great stay. The GM, Nick knew it was a special event, and my friends had everything planned out for me. The hotel staff and guest went above and beyond to make our stay a great one. Would highly recommend visiting this gorgeous hotel!"
5,Great weekend,"Came to Austin for a bachelor party and we stayed here. The location could not have been better. It was near the most popular bars and restaurants in the area. We walked to all the places we wanted to go and didn’t have to worry about drinking too much cause we would always be able to walk back. The gym and the pool are really well done and the views from the rooftop are fantastic. The price was very high but I guess because of the events it was tough to get a great deal. The rooms were clean, but they definitely need fans in the bathrooms. The lobby bar/restaurant was delicious and the service there and from the front desk was excellent and very sincere. The design of the lobby was really well done. It was nice and easy to meet up there before our evenings out. The rooms were maintained nicely by the housekeeping service and we always had enough towels and accessories. Overall this was a great stay and I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Austin."
5,Friendly environment,"Me and my friends were here for a bachelorette party, stayed for 4 nights and it was a great experience, the hotel was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. Not to mention the assistant GM Nick went beyond his way to make sure we had an unforgettable stay!"
1,Beware of HOTEL THIEF!,"This hotel has a THIEF ON-STAFF. An expensive blouse was stolen from the closet of our room, and the hotel is refusing to take responsibility. Even as a Marriott Bonvoy Platinum, they are lie, lie, deny and won’t acknowledge that one of their team members stole the blouse from the closet of the room. SHAME ON THEM!"
5,Short visit; Incredible time,Had a great time at the Westin using the workout room and rooftop area. The staff was amazing in accomodating my last second flight delay and helping with locational recommendations for food and drinks.
5,Student Housing Conference Hotel,"Check-in and check-out was great. Service at the desk was very good. Room cleaning and restocking very good. Food and beverage service at Stella was great, but you need chips or nuts to munch on the stuff currently being served is terrible."
4,Very Mixed Bag,"OK, this is a vastly different Westin experience from the one we had two nights previously in the Westin San Antonio,While the SA branch is in a picturesque part of town, this is the centre of hard core party town.That's not to say it's bad. Just different.The experience here was alot different.First. The Parking.You are told online that valet is ""the best way, as parking options are difficult"".Not really true.There are lots of parking garages pretty closeby, as we found out going walkabout.I would have looked into this more closely if we went back again, as it cost me $100 (gulp!) for two nights parking. $100 plus tip, of course.The hotel itself?Reception wasn't quite as helpfull as the SA branch with my request for two queen beds.""none available"".We checked in at 3pm. Really? None available.?The lift only worked with this weird ""hold your key over a scanner then select your floor"" function.The decor is more clinical rather than relaxing with it's shiny,shiny fixtures, but each to their own.The big USP is the rooftop views. Very impressive.Didn't eat in, so no idea what the restaurant was like.Found a good value breakfast cafe two streets away.We wondered why they put earplugs in the room.Every morning at 6.30am, your question is answered!They are building a new hotel next door, and the digging starts early!!Be warned!!Excellent location as most tourist stuff is in walking distance"
5,"Here to spend my anniversary. Wonderful location, property and staff","I was here to spend my 5 year anniversary. When we checked in the front desk member offered us a $50 voucher to be used at the hotel which was very nice and they certainly didn’t have to do that but much appreciated. He also upgraded us to a higher floor and better room.The hotel is one block away from E. 6th Street for all local bars, restaurants and plenty of activities.The rooms are clean, big and comfortable. The beds are amazing. Almost didn’t want to get out of bed.The rooftop pool and bar are great. It was unusually cold when we were there but they had fire pits.I would def stay here again. This property doesn’t have an executive lounge but we were offered breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel but it’s Austin and there are plenty of food trucks around!!!"
4,Solid downtown choice with only a few minor challenges,"Pros: Room was very clean and (mostly) quiet. Thick double windows helped to keep street noise out. Good shower with strong water pressure. Location was very central and walkable. Front desk and housekeeping staff were very accommodating.Cons: We were on 19th floor, each morning we could hear people dropping weights in the gym above us. Busy hotel with a bustling rooftop/pool area with very little space available to sit and relax. Part of rooftop was closed for different special events on 2 nights during our stay. Rooftop food menu is very limited. Ordered fries, server brought them in a very large paper bag with handles (the kind you get when you buy clothing at a department store; 5 shirts and 3 pairs of pants would have fit in that bag). Very wasteful and not eco friendly. The giant bag had the fries and 20 ketchup packets but no napkins? Weird."
4,"Ok, but difficultif you have a car","Hotel was lovely, Stella Rest outstanding. Rained all weekend and w/2 kids and rainy weekend, we used it a lot. Food excellent, w/grt choices for kids. Pity no parking on site, valet parking ($49/night) egregious. Parking elsewhere a hassle in rain. Disappointing. Wifi poor."
5,Nice Hotel,We enjoyed staying at this hotel and would definitely stay here again when we come to Austin. They were sold out for the earlier part of the trip and the other hotel we chose wasn’t as nice nor as friendly even though it was part of the same conglomerate of hotels. Highly recommend staying here and the view from the rooftop pool was one of the best in the city!
5,Great Respite,A great hotel. Great location. Comfy room and bath. Nice staff. Wish restaurant and bar were bigger. The menu could offer more selections. The french press coffee and tea was wonderful. The bar tv should show live sports instead of loops of sponsored videos.
5,Gorgeous hotel with delicious food and drinks and excellent location!,"Cannot wait to come back again! Came for a work conference and had never been to Austin before. What a fun and cool city! Live music everywhere you turn, dancing, so many good food options. Will be coming back next time for a girls weekend!"
2,Tons of construction noise,stayed there April 1- April 3. There was jack hammering starting at 5 am every day! Made me sleep miserably and haven't been contacted by hotel mgmt around any sort of apology or compensation. The facility itself is nice but for the price I wish I stayed at the hilton. Check in was also really bad as they had our rooms mixed up. One person specifically was very rude. A gentleman with name starting with J.
3,Not a good time to stay here,Sadly my review was tainted to no fault of their own. The hotel is in a good location to convention center. Nice restaurants near by. Rooms are of average size and watch for surge pricing. Sadly construction is going on next door and the pounding starts at 7am. They don’t warn you about this but they are aware. Some of my colleagues got a note and ear plugs in their rooms. I had to call to find out what the non stop loud banging noise was. This ruined the whole stay. It’s consistant and like torture. Stay away while this construction is happening.
5,Nice Family Visit,Westin was a nice stay. Room was great and food was above average for a hotel. Front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating. My only concern was I am used to having a Consier Lounge when I stay and this level of hotel.
5,Great get away stay-cation!,"Great pool on top floor! Friendly staff and great opportunity to enjoy good food and location. Quiet and good sleeping beds. TV has good channel selection. The shower was awesome, and room service was great!"
4,Great value,What a fabulous hotel downtown Austin. Stayed in room 927 with a view over 6th Ave. I LOVED the windows in this hotel. Lying in bed I could see the lights at night and in the morning we could see watch the sun riseThe hair dryer was just average. But nice toiletriesWalking distance to most attractions and lots of restaurants nearby
2,NOT KID FRIENDLY,"If you are in early 20’s with no kids with you this place is absolutely 100% for you! However, if you have children of any age with you during your stay this place is NOT for you!! The pool is TINY, the photos online are SO misleading...... The pool is filled with young college aged day pass people wearing next to nothing. You cannot order food to be sent to the pool for the children and when I ordered room service it took 55 minutes to arrive and it was mediocre at best...... I asked when we arrived if this hotel was kid friendly and was assured it was.... DO NOT be fooled by the front desk staff and/or online photographs this place is NOT for kids or families."
5,"Great Hotel, sky high parking rates","The room was nice, very quiet on the 15th floor, except for the construction work on the 16th floor, you could hear people dragging stuff around up there. The Windows are double insulated, but that does stop the sound. Parking is 48/night."
5,Jesse and Roslyn are the best!,"I recently had a business meeting at Stella at the Westin Austin downtown during SXSW. Not only was the restaurant exceedingly pleasant, with lots of natural light, comfortable seats, and a cool vibe, but our servers, Jesse and Roslyn were fun, personable, and attentive but not overly so. Roslyn also had the coolest pin collection in Austin, hands down. Looking forward to seeing them next year!"
5,Azul Bartender David made our experience an absolute delight!,"Rooftop pool and bar (Azul) is a must visit at this Westin hotel in downtown Austin, Texas. Excellent views of the whole downtown matched with a great bar and wonderful drinks. Our Host/Bartender David not only went above and beyond catering to us with wonderful drinks but had some excellent suggestions of thing to do/visit in the beautiful city of Austin. If only all Bartenders were this sweet. We found it hard to leave that bar! ;)We shall return!"
5,Excellent atay,Kudos to Yisemia from housekeeping for making my 7-night stay enjoyable. Appreciate your attention to detail Yisemia!! Also appreciate the security staff for holding the fort down during a busy week with SXSW going on.
5,Mrs Keeli Wilson,"Jorge was the absolute BEST! Was so sweet and knowledgeable! Every question that we had, he had Great suggestions. Was very upbeat and energetic. Made our stay one of the best experiences ever. LOVE him!!!!"
5,Great location and Stella restaurant that is connected is a definite plus!,"Jorge was so very helpful with reservations and recommendations for local restaurants. He had such great energy and very approachable. Also, Matt was a huge help with our parking dilemma and didn't make us feel like we were a problem at all. The city is super busy and crowded for SXSW and the staff has been very professional and welcoming. We appreciate the awesome hospitality."
5,Great,"Great stay, would have liked a softer bed. Jorge the concierge was especially helpful. The area in Austin is fantastic, tons to do around the hotel, good food and entertainment. Great music around also."
5,Lunch at Stella,"Had lunch at Stella’s with some friends. Cesilee was our waitress and she did an amazing job waiting on our group. Food was amazing, great quality and excellent service. Try the deviled eggs if you’re wanting something unique. Highly recommend!"
5,Excellent Service,"Came in for dinner with a friend and was treated to the experience of a life time. Cesilee’s knowledge of the menu and wine was complemented by her infectious, inviting personality, and her attention to detail. We look forward to more great experiences with Cesilee in the future!"
4,Great location and friendly staff,"I was in town for SXSW and really enjoyed my stay here. The front desk staff was extremely friendly, and one woman remembered my name during my entire five day stay. The lobby is nicely designed and roomy, perfect for people watching. My room was big, especially the bathroom. My floor also happened to be fairly quiet, although the door to the room next to me wasn’t thick enough to keep some of the noise next door out of my room. The location was excellent for getting to anything downtown."
5,Front desk,Jorge Thank you so much for being so sweet. You were so full of energy and so funny 😀 First time in Austin and felt so welcomed by you 😊 Thank you so much for sure next time i come to Austin i will stay here again.
5,Front desk,First time in Austin and we recieved an awesome welcoming from Jorge at the front desk. He immediately informed us the ins and out of Austin. Thank you so much. I am most likely coming back to this family friendly hotel.
5,Fantastic Meal & Service,"Stopped by Stella for dinner tonight and had a wonderful meal. Our server, Chris, was a delight to be around and gave us great recommendations. I had the scallops with a citrus, fennel salad that was a breath of fresh air. Those biscuits are to die for."
5,Restaurant Stella is phenomenal,"There are a boatload of excellent restaurants in Austin, yet I liked this one enough to visit it twice. The biscuits blew my mind and server Chris was delightful. Absolutely worth a stop - I can vouch for both brunch and dinner!"
5,Unexpected Energy at The Westin Downtown,"Great hotel - perfect location and energetic vibe. Modern restaurant and bar- Roslyn is wonderful! - highly recommend this property. Newly remodeled, clean and crisp, large rooms, and those classic Westin beds!"
5,Complete Bliss with Chris,Our meal at Stella started off strong with the best server in town. Chris very knowledgeable about the menu and provided a full history of Stella’s DSD partnership with coke vs Pepsi. He followed it up with solid recommendations on the appetizers which he delivered with incredible speed. Chris for the win! 🙌🙌
5,Attention to Detail,Enjoyed my first-ever stay at the Westin downtown and will certainly be returning. It's nice to stay at a property where staff takes the time to get to know you and your needs. Hats off to Jorge at the Front Desk who continuously made sure I was having a great stay!
5,Amazing Stay in Austin,"Wonderful service at the Westin! The staff went above and beyond. They were friendly, timely, helpful and responsive. The property was well located in downtown and close to many activities. The hotel was clean and nicely appointed."
5,Great dinner at Stella,"Came for dinner at their first floor restaurant. Food was delicious and service was outstanding. Sit in Chris' section if you can. Highly recommend the biscuit appetizer, deviled eggs, and pork dinner."
5,Great experience!,"Stayed at the hotel and had a fantastic dinner at Stella Jac. Was in town for SXSW and the location was perfect for all the events, good people watching too. Great service from our server Chris at dinner. Definitely recommend!"
5,SXSW Dinner,Chris was a great host at the Westin!Can’t recommend enough. We had a team dinner and cocktails and Chris took care of us all and kept the whole crew well fed & beverages. I’m certain that we will be back this week and next time.Thank you Westin!
5,Dinner at Stella for 6,"Chris! Chris! Chris!Great service from the time we walked in. We’re a large party of 6 here for SXSW looking for a place to have dinner with vegetarian options and Stella was such a great choice.I did not order vegetarian but I do recommend the lamb meatballs, deviled eggs and biscuits. They’re the chef specialty for good reason!"
5,Stella San Jac Dinner,"This is my second trip here and a significant improvement from the last (staff wise, the food is stellar). Staff (specifically Chris) were extraordinarily courteous and attentive. #16 biscuits are worth it alone. I had a Sazerac to drink and holy moly it was smooth. Lamb meatballs are super savory (3 per order). The deviled eggs (3/order) are made with a stronger Dijon mustard than I'm used to which gives them and really savory and unique taste. Short ribs completely fell apart which is fantastic. The sweet potato mash was very buttery. Yum!"
5,What a treat!,"Highly recommend this spot.I come to work at the bar often and the guys here are amazing and the food and drinks are rather delicious.The bartenders are friendly and knowledgable and keep me coming back, Roslyn and Jessee are a treat Scott is always here and he is a pleasure also.Treat yourself and try the altos cocktail on tap, or the stellar spritzer."
5,Chris was fantastic!,"Great atmosphere with phenomenal service. Chris had a great attitude and made it an incredible experience. The music choice was upbeat and trendy with a creative food menu. We will be back!Thank you, Chris!"
5,Fun dinner at Stella San Jac,"Chris was an awesome waiter!! 10/10 would visit again. Good drinks, nice ambiance, great location! Best desserts. Don’t miss the light-up “ATX” sign in the lobby - it’ll be your next Instagram profile pic."
5,Above and beyond,"Visiting Austin for business and received fantastic service and atmosphere at the Westin. The restaurant, Stella San Jac, was great as well. Among all the many options in Austin, I would highly recommend the Westin."
5,Great experience,"Had an amazing dinner at Stella - must go! Love this location and the service is top notch. Ask for Chris at Stella!! We had the famous biscuits and they did not disappoint! Also, the fried avocado salad, oh and the short ribs AND the pork chop! I think i could go on and on😊"
5,A hotel to remember - loved it!,"This place is close to 6th street. Area felt a bit dodgy on arrival but once I got used to it, it was fine. In walking distance to the high street, Capitol, river, restaurants etc. Even walked to South Congress which took me about 40 mins. A really interesting walk!Now back to the hotel. It was fantastic. I had a suite (upgrade) with huge glass windows floor to ceiling. The view was right over to the Frost building. There was a great modern sitting room with sofas for watching tv and a dining/working table. Of course you had lots of wardrobe space, a tea and coffee machine and ironing equipment. The separate bedroom, with a second big flat screen, had a huge comfortable bed and gave way to a very big bath room with shower and bathtub. On the rooftop there was a very nice swimming pool, and a bar, which I did not use, as it was February, but the view was spectacular. The same great view was to be had from the well equipped gym on the rooftop.Breakfast was a bit confusing as you had to order it à la carte and the selection was rather unusual for my European taste. It was nice and tasty but if I stayed for more days, I would prefer a normal buffet breakfast. For supper I went to a nice barbecue place not far from the hotel, so can´t comment on the restaurant. I would go back in a heartbeat, great place!"
5,Rooftop Bar,Dave the bartender of Weston’s Azul rooftop bar is killing it! Great location up here with the pool and view of Austin’s downtown. Can’t beat a good drink with a good view in the pool. Would highly recommend.
5,Love The Hotel,I love Austin but Never Stayed Downtown before So Beside Me Loving the Location.. I was Greeted With Such hospitality As Soon As I walked through the Door Jorg’e Was Such A Sweet Heart! And very Accomodating
5,Excellent service!,"We checked in at the counter, and Jorge was very nice. He was happy to accommodate our room requests. For the most part, our room seemed pretty mediocre and even though the hotel location was great, it didn’t seem to really warrant the price, which I stated on an internal review after logging into the WiFi. Immediately after I submitted the review, the front desk manager Isabelle called up to our room asking if everything was okay and what she could do to make our stay more enjoyable. It was such a great gesture. Later that evening my husband went to the lobby and Jorge greeted him happily by name. The rooftop pool area was beautiful and clean and the breakfast in Stella San Juan was incredible. We had smoked salmon eggs Benedict and the lemon blueberry pancakes. The hotel staff really goes out of their way to be hospitable."
5,Fantastic hotel - what a great surprise!,"We chose this hotel through the Marriott site, needing one downtown, near a music venue. We were thrilled with it in so many ways. The hotel was close to the airport, right in the middle of downtown, near everything going on. The hotel itself was very cool. Great lobby, as you walked in - excellent restaurant and bar. We have to single out Jorge at the front desk. He was amazing and went out of his way to help. We ended up renting a second room last minute for some members of our son's band. Jorge was incredibly helpful, and went way beyond to make us happy. He is a real asset to your team there. We also loved our cocktail server, CeCe (not sure of spelling) who treated us wonderfully while we drank and lounged in the bar, waiting for the band to get there. The six of us enjoyed delicious hor's doeuvres and craft cocktails. The brunch was fantastic on Sunday! The biscuits are to die for. On our last night, not wanting to venture out, my husband and I enjoyed an excellent meal in the restaurant. I strongly recommend the pan seared chicken with grits. Delish! We did head up to see the rooftop bar and pool, although sadly, the weather was too cold to hang out there. We definitely would like to come back when it's warmer. All in all, this was a fantastic hotel and we would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Westin qualit!,"overall great experience.The Westin Hotel Austin Downtown is what you expect from the Westin chain/level.Location : excellent, in the middle of everywhereCheck-in: smooth and quickRooms: Clean and spacious.Common areas: very well maintained, nice bar with good selectionAll in all, great stay and highly recommended for business or pleasure."
5,Embodies My Top Four Priorities,"The four things I look for in a hotel are: safe, clean, quiet, and location. This Westin had all four. The hotel is two blocks from Congress street where there are many great hotels and bars. It’s in a very safe part of town, clean, and equally important to me it is quiet. I didn’t eat in the hotel because there are too many great places to eat in Austin, but they have a nice bar and they make good drinks, so it was great for the first and last drinks of the night. There is a restaurant across the street, Russian House, which has great food and more vodka selections than one can imagine. Definitely worth a meal or a drink.I’m happy Westin hotels are now part of the Marriott family. Just wish they had an M Lounge like the Marriotts do."
5,Great Weekend,"This has been our second stay at the hotel, and we would come back anytime. The service was excellent, starting with the front desk personnel. Christos, the receptionist, was particularly kind. Our room was immaculate and the housekeeping staff took care of every detail. The food was pretty good, too. My favorite breakfast dish here, Smoked Salmon Benedict is awesome! Overall it was a very nice stay. We really enjoyed it!"
5,GRP Connect,"The hotel was beautiful and the staff terrific. Special kudos to Jorge Padilla at the front desk, he treated me like my own personal concierge- so helpful and nice. My stay was a lovely experience. Never got to try the rooftop bar became of the weather, but the view was amazing."
5,Excellent customer service,"We were a group of 9 women who had to scramble to find last minute accommodations due to a misrepresented Airbnb property. The staff at the Westin were incredibly kind and accommodating. They placed our group together on the same floor and salvaged our weekend with their incredible hospitality. The rooms were great and clean, and the customer service was top notch. We would all return to the Westin in a heartbeat! Thank you!"
5,"Great hotel, great location, and great staff","Had an issue with getting into our room one night--- had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come up...and the hotel 'made it right'.Was incorrectly charged an extra night and the hotel again fixed the issue. Staff was friendly, location was great--- just off of 6th street.Thank you!"
5,"Great hotel, Great service!","Jorge was amazing! I really appreciated Jorge’s kindness and commitment to ensuring that I had an outstanding experience. While there are many wonderful hotel choices in downtown Austin, Jorge would be the reason I’d return to the Westin. For me, great customer service is more important than anything else. Thanks, Jorge!"
5,Overall good but valet overpriced,Valet was $49 per night so be prepared. Otherwise an excellent stay. Staff all went out of their way to help with anything you needed. Rooms were beautiful and very clean. Meeting spaces were nice and also very well appointed.
2,Connecting the Dots,"I'm a BonVoy Titanium Elite Member. The hotel itself was great; I plan to stay there for the next several months. However, my status was not acknowleged at check-in; this is just another example of how flawed the SPG - BonVoy integration has been."
5,"Fun spot, great service!","I've stayed here once before and was very excited to return. I should have chosen a cheaper hotel (for work reasons), but I knew I'd have a better experience here thanks to the excellent service. Jorge checked me in a d made sure my stay was perfect. The staff was super helpful whenever I had a question (restaurant recommendation) or request (more of my favorite lotion). Next time I'm here (I'll only stay here!) I hope I can try the roof top bar!!"
5,Great Hotel - Great Service - Great Training by White Lodging,"The hotel extremely clean, the staff was exceptional. After speaking with over 18 staff members in 3 days, I found all members to be out going, well groomed and showed exceptional customer service skills. I had room service twice and ate at the bar 2 times.The food was presented very well."
5,A great stay over event weekend,"I stayed at the Westin Austin Downtown over the weekend of the Austin Half Marathon with a big group of charity runners. The hotel was fantastic. It was easily accessible to all activities and from the airport, and walk-able to so many restaurants and entertainment. The facility was clean and comfortable. The staff was kind and helpful. Valet was easy. Room service was prompt and polite. The views from the rooms were even great!"
5,Stella San Jac Valentine’s Day Date,My date booked a wonderful belated Valentine’s Day Reservation at the Stella San Jac Restaurant located inside the hotel and it was superb. Service was fantastic and the ambiance was beautiful. Our waiter Chris was so knowledgeable and helpful with the menu and recommendations. The deviled eggs with andouille sausage was delicious. We had the Chicken Fried Venison Loin and Braised Short Rib. Chris was also kind enough to ask chef Comacho to come talk with us while gave our sincere compliments. A memorable night.
5,Really enjoyed our stay,"Recently stayed 3 nights & was able to get suite upgrade for 2 of those, with upgraded room for a free anniversary night. Smaller, with more individual service, but same upscale amenities compared to the JW just a few blocks away. No concierge lounge, but great menu for comped breakfast at Stella Jac. Rooftop pool has a wonderful view of the city, although we had rain through most of our stay. Looks like that could get pretty crowded in good weather. My only suggestion for the hotel would be to move the toilet paper holder in the suite closer to the toilet - it's a loooooong reach!!"
5,Wonderful,"My overall stay at the Westin was amazing! Olivia checked me in, if I’m not mistaken. She was very sweet and welcoming. The room was very clean and comfortable. Beautiful view of the city from the 6th floor. I loved every bit of It! Thanks to everyone at the westin!🙌🏽"
2,Don’t plan on sleeping,Nice hotel but this is my fifth (and thankfully final) night of being awake at midnight because all I can hear is music from the street below. I thought it would get better once the weekend was over. But no. And it’s not like I’m on lower floors. I’m on 19 and there are only 20.An Uber driver that dropped me off yesterday asked how I found the noise. Apparently this hotel is well known for its noise issues.Unfortunately the lack of sleep has left me too grumpy to say anything nice.
5,TC,"Besides being very clean and well maintained, the front staff was amazing. Jorge not only made sure that we were comfortable but also took care of our late night dinner reservation. What a friendly place in Austin!!"
5,Amazing,"We have very high standards when it comes to hotels and Marriott. This hotel went above and beyond to make us comfortable. There was an issue in the room they put us in and they immediately put us in an upgraded room and sent up a bottle of wine and snacks to apologize. We are almost ambassador Marriott status and we’ve never been treated so well from the check in, maids, valet, bartenders, etc. Well done."
3,Pretty Okay,"It may have been my fault, because I didn’t pester the hotel. But, I’m SPG Gold, not too high up, but it was my BDay week, and we really expected to get an upgrade. I’ve never NOT had one. They were very nice about it, but when the hotel cleared out, I never heard from them about an upgrade, so we had a small, standard, average room with NO BATHTUB!!!! They gave me a $30.00 lunch voucher, which was nice, but they never contacted me on our upgrade. Disappointing. Also, wine pours are lame and sure small, for $13.00, they should give you something more than less than 6 ounces. I want to state that everyone was nice, friendly, and sweet. But, they didn’t go over and above to try to accommodate our requests for a room upgrade, as we were anticipating. And it was our vacation. And my Birthday."
5,Dinner,We met our out of town family for dinner at Stella San Jac. We luckily couldn’t have chosen a better place for dinner! Our server Chris was a delight to dine with. He was knowledgeable about the whole menu and so friendly! The food and atmosphere were stellar too! Highly reccommend!
5,Stella san jac,Dinner was absolutely delicious.....The environment is great as well! Thank you to our wonderful server Chris he did a wonderful job suggesting food items that paired deliciously!!!! Thank so much Chris!
5,Stella San Jac,"This was my first time visiting Austin and we chose to have dinner at Stella San Jac on the first night. We were all blown away by the service and quality of food. Chris, our server was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. He had great suggestions, not only on the food but paired the wine perfectly. I will definitely be back when I visit again."
5,Wonderful Austin stay!,"I had the greatest stay at the Westin, from the moment I checked in! Jeremy at the front desk was exceptionally friendly and welcoming - a blessing, as it was VERY late at night and I was tired after working all day then having my flight delayed. He made sure I was in my preferred room type, showed me where the hotel restaurant (& bar!) was, and offered a number of suggestions for fun areas to explore that were within walking distance - and that involved food trucks! By the end of my check-in process & conversation with Jeremy I was no longer tired or crabby, but chipper enough to enjoy an Aperol Spritz & appetizers in their lounge. The room was glorious (King corner room) with a deliciously cozy comforter - which came in handy when snoozing through parts of this year's Superbowl...The gym is terrific, with plenty of cardio & weight machines, free weights, kettlebells (!), Bosu and Swiss balls, medicine balls and even a TRX station, which I love! Every employee I spoke with was happy to help in any way possible, and always with a smile. Loved the atmosphere - upscale without being stuffy! I will definitely stay at this Westin on my next trip to Austin!"
5,Team WOW!!,From beginning to end this staff at the Westin made me feel like I was the only guest. Olivia greeted me and made me feel right at home when I checked in. The biscuits are amazing. Roof top bar was fabulous.
5,Day trip to Austin,"This was an unplanned trip. We used points to secure the room and was upgraded. Great room, front desk and valet service was excellent. Even the folks in the restaurant were a delight. I think that the Parking cost of $49 was a bit on the high side."
5,Wonderful Service,"We would like to give our compliments to Jorge who was working at the front desk when we checked in. Jorge clearly loves his job and was extremely pleasant and friendly. Upon checking us in he asked my wife and I if we had dinner plans, we asked him for suggestions and without hesitation he called a nearby restaurant and made us reservations. Dinner was excellent. My job requires me to stay in hotels 60 to 70 nights a year, Jorge provided exceptional service well above to the normal hotel experience."
3,Westin-Austin,- Breakfast selection is very good but taste/quality could be improved.- Room has no power outlet near work desk.- Quality of soap / shampoo can be improved.- front desk staff very helpful and friendly.
3,Quality Convenience at a Price!,"While attending the Texas Association of School Administrators conference the last week in January, I was fortunate to book a room at the Westin. The quality of rooms and service was unequalled. However, because of the conference, all of the blocked rooms at the discount rate were booked and I had to pay full rate, which compromises my obligation to remain fiscally responsible to my district. Upon further investigation i found that the blocked rooms were sold out within minutes of opening, which means someone may have bought all of the rooms to make a profit, like ticket scalpers do. This concerns me and gives cause to report my concern to the conference host. Again, loved the service, location and quality of my stay, it just violated my trust."
5,"Very nice hotel, Excellent Restaurant, Friendly Staff",I stayed at the hotel for a conference. It is very conveniently located near the convention center. The room was comfortable. The staff is very professional and friendly. The highlight of the stay was the breakfast. The weekend menu was just wonderful while the weekday menu items were fresh and served in a pleasant setting.
5,Amazing views and customer service,"As though the amenities of this hotel weren't impressive enough, the level of friendliness, attention and help we received from the Westin team truly made us feel welcome and at home. Also, if you stay here—or even just come here for a business meeting—and don't take a trip up to take a picture of the gorgeous downtown view from the pool deck, then what are you doing? Priorities people."
5,Stay for Business,Stayed two nights for a conference held at the hotel. Customer service and cleanliness of the hotel were great! Close to great restaurants. Will definitely recommend this hotel for those coming to the Austin area.
5,Great hotel!,"Great hotel! Food was outstanding, service impeccable and centrally located. Highly recommend this property for business or leisure. Beds are very comfortable and hotel is walking distance to numerous restaurants ."
3,My Review,"I had a couple issues with your Morning Meal service. The first issue was waking up and noticing that no one picked up my meal order placed on my door - I placed it the previous afternoon. The second was an error on my meal order this morning. Fortunately, the representatives at the service desk resolved each issue pleasantly and promptly. I was disappointed to have experienced 2 morning inconveniences from a caliber of a hotel like yours."
5,Excellent Stay,"Everything that you would expect from a Westin property. Clean, Comfortable and upscale. Food was very good and the rooftop bar was amazing. Business meeting was handled professionally and every need was attended by prompt servers."
5,Great into to Austin,"Great location and overall environment. I got in after some flight delays and late at night and had a great experience getting checked in and working with the staff throughout my stay. Also, the rain type showers were amazing."
1,Overbooked,"Showed up for my 3 nights stay, only to be told they overbooked the hotel and I was relocated to the Omni. WTF...are they an airline? I will never stay at a Westin again. Only booked there because of a group meeting and if they can’t honor all members of the group then they lose my business at all locations. Buyer Beware"
3,Not a business traveler hotel,"Being Marriott Platinum Premier I have stayed at many Marriott and now Starwood properties. While this hotel is clean, has a good gym and a nice rooftop skyline view the internet service is beyond horrible. Logged in using the enhanced WiFi that most guests must pay for I cannot do a simple conference call let alone watch a video. If your looking to work from your room you should choose another hotel - would not recommend for business travelers (this issue occurred morning, afternoon and was worse at night)."
5,Staff Made Our Stay,Front Desk Staff was exceptional. Smooth check in and lots of tips for where to go. Spent a lot of time in the bar area. Friendly staff and delicious bar appetizers. Housekeeping efficient and everyone provided service with a smile.
5,Restaurant,Stopped in to grad a quick bite and was insteally greeted with lovely faces! Chris our server did an excellent job and was very friendly. Highly recommend him as y’all server! Such a great location and excellent food!
5,Amazing job Chris!,"Superb ambiance with excellent food and wide variety of drinks. Recommend this whether it's a convenient stop, or a leisurely dinner. My friend got a old fashioned cocktail, we enjoyed biscuits as a group."
5,Stella Restaurant,Chris was freaking awesome! he took care of us and gave me the greatest 21st birthday with his service! Coming back soon! Also big thanks to Nick the Gm who was also a big help. I recommend this place to anyone in the area.
5,"Hotel great, homeless people in area not so","All of the staff we encountered were top notch. The hotel was clean and centrally located. As for downtown Austin, if you don't like to be bothered all the time by homeless people asking you for money or giving you an unsafe feeling then don't stay downtown. I don't know if I will back some day but if I do I won't be staying downtown. The best experience we had was on S Congress Ave for music and food so I would look there as we didn't encounter any homeless people there."
5,Great Experience,"The hotel is in the perfect location, the rooms are big and comfortable. I love the gym, pool and rooftop nightlife experience. If you need to stay in Austin The Westin is an execellent choice. The staff is always welcoming and accommodating to every need that may arise. From the views to the location to the Heavenly beds and showers, this is my place to stay when visiting Austin."
5,Front desk,"Jorge Flores Padilla is honestly one of the most amazing and kindhearted workers ever. He made our check in and entire stay experience inevitably easy and amazing. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are comforting, and staff is so sweet, courteous, and always goes out their way to make our stay amazing. Especially Jorge in particular, he was funny, and greeted personally all the companions i had who were checking in with me, he also sent me text messages to ensure that all my needs were being met. Thank you Jorge for a memorable experience. Definitely recommend this hotel."
5,Merry Birthmas!,"I was visiting my sister right before Christmas for her birthday and chose this hotel for our stay.The staff was friendly and professional. Rooms were clean. Try the smoked salmon at the restaurant, it was great! The rooftop bar was BEAUTIFUL and the fire pit was super cozy. We had a great time and I would definitely stay again!"
5,Fantastic experience,"This review is for the restaurant, Stella San Jac. Visited with some friends last night and I was blown away by the experience! Our waiter, Chris, was very attentive and personable, and made great recommendations and conversation with us. I had the Texas redfish, which was excellent, and the Brussels sprouts and biscuits were also great. Cocktails were divine. And, last but not least, Nick is an outstanding manager! Hope to see y’all again soon!"
5,Outstanding Service on Every Level!! Highly recommended!,"If you are looking for a hot spot to stay in downtown Austin Texas look no further! The Westin has the finest amenities... from the moment you walk in until your departure you are surrounded by luxury. I travel with my dad who is a 99 year old World War II veteran and we were instantly greeted by Jorge at the front desk his recognition for my father and his excitement for his job, it's like none I've ever seen! The rooms are modern and spacious and we enjoyed fine dining downstairs at the restaurant! Abby is an incredible server and remembered us when we came back for New Year's Eve! Amy at the front desk is exceptional as well, she remembered my dad's name and his favorite chocolate! The location is perfect right in the center of downtown close to everything you need! There are a lot of nice properties in the downtown Austin area but the service here is what sets it apart!"
4,Gingerbread House Suite,Another stop on our downtown holiday tour which brings us to the Westin Austin Downtown. This is a very nice hotel and always enjoy coming here. It is right in the heart of live music with 6th around the corner and Antone’s Nightclub across the street. I have eaten at Stella San Jac and it is very good. The bar scene is great especially the pool which is the highest in Austin. Non guest can go up there for a fee.Today was to check out the holiday decorations and first I noticed was the enormous gingerbread house. It was so big you can actually dine inside it and nicely decorated. It was definitely a show stopper.The outside seating area for Stella San Jac is dog friendly with tables on artificial turf with doggie bowls.I went to the bar and rested by having a drink. The bartender was nice and did a great job
5,Wonderful Service,"When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted and helped by Jorge, who was absolutely great! He continued to check in on us throughout our stay and we felt very taken care of by him. The building of course is so beautiful and modern and our room had a fabulous view of 6th Street, as well. Overall, we enjoyed staying here!Give Jorge a raise!"
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"This experience was absolutely perfect. The rooms were immaculate, and the service was unbelievable. Every person we encountered was so kind and helpful. They made our transition unbelievably easy and joyful.Also, Jorge deserves a raise."
3,"Fairly good, but good customer service","Great customer service, but side of the hotel faces bars and clubs that are loud. The offer to switch rooms was nice. The gym was clean. The location was good to central Austin. Would have been nice to be able to turn the air down."
3,Great food and service,Honestly great service at this hotel. Try the club sandwich and have wine by the roaring fire.The room lighting situation was not greatNo ceiling lights and hard to find the lamp switches. They should make this easier
5,Wedding Anniversary!!!,"This was a FANTASTIC stay for our wedding anniversary!!! The property is nice but the service at this location WAS THE BEST EVER and defined our entire stay. Every staff member we encountered was so nice, helpful, and polite - honestly, the service by the staff was the difference maker. Bryce helped us get our cars in the garage and was such a welcoming and great person. This was followed by Jorge who helped us at the front desk and he was amazing. He made check in a breeze and helped us with a late check out in case we needed it in the morning. He also helped us with our Marriott points to make sure we got credit for the stay. He told us to make brunch reservations for the next morning and truly wanted us to have the best stay ever. The Stella restaurant brunch was wonderful and the service was incredible. If there was a down side to our visit, it was that there was no place to take our dogs to do their business and the front desk could only suggest to go across the street to a construction site which was not safe at that time of the night.Overall, we rate it a 5+ because of the service. The property is nice, but the staff go out of their way to help you have a wonderful stay. We will definitely have another stay in the near future!!"
5,An Amazing Experience,"The staff here were concerned about every detail of our stay. Jorge at the desk made our arrival memorable and the rooftop pool made our night. Next visit, we'll try a workout guest room just to change it up."
5,"Excellent hotel, especially for the price","Everything about this hotel was perfect. The service, the posh room, the comfy bed, the neat bar downstairs, and the waters the valet placed in our cup holders before we left. Granted we paid $42 for one night so a part of me hoped they left the rest of the case of water in the back for that price, but it’s downtown Austin. Anytime I stay in Austin this will be where I’ll stay."
5,Good experience,Big shoutout to Jorge for making my visit a lot better. He was so nice and helpful! I recommend everyone to ask for him when visiting the Westin downtown Austin! Thanks again Jorge for all your kindness!
5,A GREAT weekend,Our weekend at the Westin was nothing short of amazing. We heard about the Westin being a really great place to stay. I'm so glad we chose it!We had one of the corner rooms that had an amazing view of the city. All the staff were great! Very friendly and approachable when we had questions. The hotel is so relaxing and has amazing views of Austin from almost every corner. The pool and bar on the rooftop is breathtaking once you go up and see the views.Also want to thank Sam And Taylor for being such amazing people. We told them we had gotten the room for a friend who was graduating and they helped us surprise her with a hand written note and a gift card for dinner. Thank you for the amazing carefree weekend.
5,Best location!,We love staying at The Westin Austin Downtown every time we are in Austin. The hotel is amazing and in a great location. Staff is very attentive and always friendly. The rooms are spacious and very clean.
5,We will return here,"From start to finish the Westin, Austin Downtown was a great choice. Perfect location. We are Marriott Platinum members, and this is our first stay here. The hotel is updated, and upscale. Rooms were extremely quiet, and exceptionally comfortable. The staff from the start was professional, helpful, friendly and vey accommodating meeting our Every request and need. Taylor (concierge) steered us in the right direction completing our stay with plenty of great music venues and choices for the all the local fare to eat.We will revisit this Westin on our next trip to Austin."
3,Good but not for the price,"My overal experience was between average and good. Overal, the place is too expensive for what you get. It is definitely lacking some features for business travelers, like not much room in the lobby for meetings, or working. Loud music in the restaurant to have a conversation. the rooms were okay, not super clean but good enough. Food was decent, but coffee sucked. It was too cold for the rooftop and gym was decent, but it could use more equipment for the price they charge."
5,Explore Austin,Every was excellent from the service to the accommodations. I called “ service express” a couple of times for miscellaneous items and it seemed that someone was at our door almost before I hung up the phone! Terrific service. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
5,"Awesome experience, location and service!",Yisenia gave me directions for great burger places on arrival and place to go as a first timer in Austin Texas and specifically leveled my wants with her suggestions.Jorae gave me water when I really needed it on the last night since we went out for drinksBathroom keeps getting restocked and cleaned which is nice! The rooms are nicer! They gave me 2 bottles of water when they noticed I kept bringing water back. Which is intuitive! VERY NICE!
5,Great experience,I've stayed here a few times. Minor drawback is it can be a bit rowdy on holidays and sometimes a bit of a party spot.The rooms and facilities here are great.The staff is excellent. One example:I ordered some supplies from Amazon that I needed for a presentation and had them shipped directly to the hotel as I could not hand carry. The package was waiting for me at the front desk when I checked in. I REALLY appreciated this and have found this level of service to be quite rare at any hotel. Thank you!Jorge Flores Padilla was excellent at getting me the things I needed and making my stay perfect.Thanks!
1,bar service is terrible,"I was meeting a few friends for dinner and was waiting in the bar area. I sat for 25 mins and watched the tables on either side of me and front of me get service. I did not once in 25 mins get asked anything. I noticed that the other tables were full of 20 somethings, good looking women and the other was a white older couple that appeared to have money. I am a mid-30's white woman, I was dressed to the 9s. After about 10 mins of observing it became clear that I was being avoided. I watched waitresses avoid eye contact and walk directly past me time after time. I even tried to flag one down, she looked me dead in the eye and turned the other direction. I went to the bar after 25 mins to then wait an additional 10 mins and the bar to never be served. At this point I decided it was not worth any more of my time and waited for my friends outside. I have never been treated so poorly."
5,"Great hotel, location and amenities","I always stay here when I'm in Austin for work. The gym is great and the pool is the perfect place to relax after a long day of meetings. Couldn't ask for a better location near good food, bars and Austin highlights. Highly recommend."
5,Great Stay-cation!,"We sold our house and purchased a new one. For 2 days, our stuff was in moving trucks, and and we were without a place to stay. We could have stayed with family or friends, but decided to make a little stay-cation out of it. Nicholas (the Asst. GM at the Westin) hooked us up with a nice room and reasonable price. When we arrived, we found we had been upgraded to a suite at no extra cost, and they even threw in a nice note and bottle of wine when we arrived in our room.The service was wonderful, they text you to make sure you do not need anything during your stay, and the food and cocktails we had at the restaurant downstairs (Stella) were great!Thanks for making our stay-cation while we were ""homeless"" fun!-Gillian & Nick"
5,Awesome place!!!,"Everything about this hotel is top notch. Beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, super comfy beds, nice showers, & quick room service. The staff is the best part though. Taylor knows this city very well and has the best recommendations on where to eat and have a great time. Shout out to Jeremy too - nothing better than a happy, friendly face to greet you when you’re coming back late at night! Thank you Westin, we’ll be back!"
5,Thanksgiving,"The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel was very well kept and nicely decorated for the holiday. Our room was well equipped, always clean and had great views of the city. One of my favorite hotels."
5,Stella San Jac,"We had a wonderful dinner at the Stella San Jac inside the Westin. It was our son’s birthday. Chris our server took great care of us. I had the awesome Prawn and Foie Grad Pad Thai. My wife enjoyed the super tender short ribs. Overall, we had a great dinner with some delicious drinks and dessert."
5,Stella San Jack Restaurant,"We had a great meal at Stella’s! Chris, our server, started us with wine & terrific biscuits! Next we had a beautifully laid out meat & cheese tray. The onion relish and creamy Brie cheese with the meat tray was a fabulous appetizer and complemented the biscuits. The entree lobster Mac and cheese was amazing! As was the chicken dish, ribs & redfish. All 4 entrees we chose, we would all choose again. We ended the dinner with a delicious Stella Kit Kat dessert made in house and a cup of coffee! Great job, Chris! Thanks for serving us and making our girls night so special! I give Stella’s a great big “Yum’s” up!!"
4,Christmas in our hood,"Had such a fun meal at the Westin restaurant, Stella SanJac. They had a giant Gingerbread House in the lobby. Dinner was yummy and we especially loved the biscuits and the charcuterie platter. Chris, our server, very helpful with the menu and a great fun personality. Great location in downtown too."
5,Best Bartenders Ever,Stayed downtown for a friends birthday and stopped to have an evening drink...Scott and Ricardo won’t disappoint! Come and have the best drinks in town by the best bartenders. Can’t wait to come back and see them again!
5,Casey Smith,Scott and Ricardo are the best bartenders ever. We have never received serviced that great. I loved how personal Scott was. He was amazing. Amazing!!!!! I suggest everyone to ask for Scott!!!!By far the best bartenders I have ever had!!!!!¡
4,Westin doesn’t disappoint.,"Great location as far as being downtown and centrally located, rooms were nice with plenty of space, clean and a refrigerator . Only downside is having to stop on the street for the valet. Hard to get to and could be a dangerous situation."
5,Austin Thanksgiving,Awesome hotel. Had a beautiful 15th floor corner room with incredible views. Pool on roof was also really incredible. Could see the entire city. Staff had assembled a lifesize gingerbread house in lobby for dining. What a unique idea! Staff was super friendly. Would recommend hotel to anyone visiting Austin.
5,Stella San Jac,"Awesome food, environment and service from our server Chris! The biscuits are a must order. This is a great spot especiallt for a girls night. We were visiting and had a great dinner and drinks here :)"
5,Great experience!,We came to the Westin to eat at Stella San Jac and had an amazing experience! I highly recommend the Biscuits for anyone looking for a salty sweet treat! Our server Chris was great and very welcoming! Enjoy!
5,AMAZING STAY,"We had a lovely stay, Chris Abinsay was the most helpful and answered all of our questions about what to do downtown. Room was big and super clean. Loved it, we'll be back for sure. Thanks Westin, y'all are great."
4,Professional Staff,"Thank you Jorge for making my friends from Hawaii feel welcome and with a wealth of knowledge about Austin! You helped by taking our picture of us at your grand Gingerbread House! The lobby is warm, inviting and very welcoming!"
5,A perfect visit,"Visiting recently and assisted by Jorge who went out of his way providing professional and friend service. He graciously took time taking our pictures in front of the life-size ""Gingerbread House"". A visit to remember always. Thank you."
5,Unique gingerbread house!,I heard about the gingerbread house in Westin Austin from my friends and could not wait to see it myself. Christmassy music that plays in the hotel together with all decorations creates a perfect atmosphere for Christmassy mood. It's very cozy place to have breakfast or dinner with your friends or family. I have never seen anything like that in the hotel. When I arrived Alena was kind enough to show me around. Thank you for the excellent service! Definitely going to come back to have dinner
5,Great Hotel,Had a great time staying at the Westin! Perfect for group outings! Loved the rooftop and it has a beautiful view of Austin.The rooms and amenities were great!Big and spacious rooms. Would definitely stay here again!
5,Amazing hotel and service,We stayed here for a girls weekend and the service was impeccableThe room was so clean and beds are extremely comfortableWould definitely stay here again!Also a plus is the rooftop bar and the brunch at the hotel restaurant
5,Wonderful service!,We had a staycation at this hotel and it was wonderful! The service was impeccable! Our room was clean and modern. The Stella restaurant had some really delicious brunch options. We will be back soon!
5,Gingerbread Masterpiece,We went to the Westin’s restaurant for a birthday dinner and were put into their gingerbread house! It was a great surprise for my friends birthday! I will be sending all my family and friends to check it out!
5,Great Stay!,I was looking for a spot downtown when vacationing with some friends. Had a great time staying at the Westin! Loved the rooftop pool vibes. The food and service was also fantastic at Azul. Would definitely stay here again!
5,Mohib and his staff are an exceptional group of people.,I recently visited Austin to celebrate my birthday with some friends. The staff at the hotel and in the restaurants treated us with the upmost respect and made our vacation a memory that we will never forget.
2,Terrible Westin experience,"I always look to stay at Westin’s as they usually don’t disappoint, but this stay was quite terrible. Upon approval, I checked in and my first room was completely unbearable. The bed was hard as a rock, and the sheets were stained in a yellowish tint. They immediate changed my room upon request. 2 nights later, after a full day’s work I ordered a burger on room service which arrived with 2 hairs embedded in the meat. Disgusting. I’m completely appalled and would never stay at this hotel again."
5,Loved everything about this place and it’s staff,"Driving up to this hotel, my boyfriend and I were greeted by the hard working, caring, efficient valet staff. Wonderful gentlemen. Walking in to this hotel, it’s very festive, clean and smells amazing. The front desk staff was AWESOME. From the time or check, to food recommendations to check out. I seen someone different every time we walked to the front counter and every single person working up there was amazing. JORGE ACEVEDO checked us in and gave us an amazing room, with a great view. Made us feel comfortable, at home and actually made us feel like royalty! The rooftop bar had an amazing view. Wish there was more lights and music to dance too. We would’ve been there all night. But decided to walk down to a couple places that the front desk had recommended, and those place were amazing. Anything from food to a night out they knew the places! Rooms were clean, great smell etc.Nothing bad to say about this place. Definitely will be going back and staying there when I decide to go to Austin again."
5,We will be back!,"I have to say I was quite skeptical about staying at a chain hotel- but the Westin was awesome. My boyfriend and I were visiting Austin for a quick vacation, and we couldn't be more happy with our 4 night stay at the Westin. We were able to check-in early (around 12pm), which was lovely after our flight. Check-in was easy and the Front Desk was helpful. Our room was very spacious and clean! The bed was so comfortable- we passed out each night and had a great night sleep. We ordered room service twice and both times the restaurant was great and easy to talk to. The food was delicious and delivered in a timely manner for both our late night dinner (24 hour room service was greatly appreciated!!) and our breakfast as well. We visited the rooftop where we had a quick drink. Loved the atmosphere and the staff was excellent all around. The location was perfect, right in the heart of downtown Austin, so we were able to walk almost everywhere- although we did our fair share of scootering- we loved it!The Westin has it together! I would highly recommend."
5,Thanksgiving Lunch/Dinner,"Once we had made reservations and arrived at the restaurant, we were immediately seated and tended to by our waitress, Holly. She was attentive, friendly, very polite, and a wonderful server! The food was absolutely spectacular and a real treat! I’d recommend going there every holiday or for any occasion!"
5,Captive Meeting,"Great location, enjoyed my time there. I highly recommend the Westin to anyone who is traveling in the Austin area. Very close to all downtown attractions and venues. The hotel bar had great offerings as well."
5,Great ATX welcome!,"I recently experienced a foot injury which required that I be in a medical boot; therefore, I was very hesitant to travel. The staff did a great job accommodating me while ensuring my comfort. The property is beautiful and the rooftop view is spectacular! Shout out to Nick and the rooftop bartender (I forgot to grab her name!). Can’t wait to to luxuriate in this posh hotel again in the near future!"
5,Ben was amazing From Jojo and Jade / kids,"I loved it, we really enjoyed the dinner, the house is so cute! We would really appreciate the great service and the hospitality. The chef came to take pictures with us, we loved Bens costume, the whole feeling of the North Pole Experience!"
3,Not My Cup but great tea,"This hotel will appeal to many, but not us. The hotel is clean, reasonably bright, has great employees, wonderful showers, and so forth. However it is firmly in the ""Austin Mindset"". Many many of the clients wore skin tight, long legged jeans, and were clearly college or recent graduates. The music was ""modern"", with driving drum beats, and dissonance. The bell boys wore jeans on a warm day, and shorts on a cold day. The bar maid one evening was particularly helpful and gracious. Next morning there were no spoons for breakfast. That waitress was way beyond pleasingly plump, wore Timberline boots, and was stuffed into oversized jeans. I think baking powder biscuits means 3"" biscuits and white gravy. What I got was 1"" disks and an exotic red sauce. Wifes eggs Benedict was a salad creation. Dining chairs have bare legs on bare wood. Think chalk on a blackboard. The tea was served in absolutely the best tea pot ever. Just wonderful. The staff didn't know how to use it."
5,Austin's best,"This is a beautiful hotel and is close to everything. My room was ready early, very clean and the food at this hotel was great. I have been staying at Marriott hotels for almost 50 and have always found them to be the best. Marriott attention to details is always very much appreciated"
5,"Visiting family, we were all impressed with the friendly and helpful staff.","The room was very inviting, the lobby was fantastic, Jorge was very helpful at the front desk, the rooftop bar and pool were awesome. Also I can’t forget about Stella’s— the food is Devine. The valet was friendly and welcoming. I look forward to another visit at the Westin."
4,Austin friendly Westin,"Above average Westin, well managed and responsiveMy check in was a bit delayed due to a flock of customers. I mentioned this on the automatic survey for frequent guests. A credit to my account was promptly made with a personal note of apologyRoom service prompt, accurate & considerate. Many restaurants near by although in house options quite decentWhen you want more than Aloft & less than a W or four seasons, you likely will enjoy this Westin Austin downtown"
5,Great Property; Great Location; Great Service,"Though initially concerned as the exterior of the building is nothing worth architectural awards, my stay at the Westin Austin was fantastic. The location is ideal, the decor hip and interesting, and the rooms well appointed and comfortable. Also there's a great gym/pool setup on the top floor, which makes your workout visually attractive. Lastly everyone there provided extraordinary service - from the bellpeople to the front desk to the bar/restaurant staff. I highly recommend this property - plus it's only a block from 6th Street or a quick uber or cab from most of the downtown venues."
3,"Great location, Jorge is a doll, a misstep or two","We had a nice room on the 8th floor overlooking the 6th Street bar scene. We were in town for a wedding, so the central location offered us access to The Driskill, Congress Ave, the river, the Capitol, and, critically for me, Antone's. Our room was comfortable and clean. The hotel requires using the room key in the elevator to access one's floor-this was hit or miss, with some people not being able to reach their rooms, others not needing the key at all. Given the public accessibility, this could cause an issue. One feature of the hotel that could have been wonderful is the rooftop bar and pool, with its view over the city. For some bizarre reason, the hotel failed to add heaters up there, and the poor bartenders were freezing though in very good spirits. We wanted to enjoy that feature, but it was too darned cold. Jorge at the front desk is a model for how to extend hospitality-shout out to you, Jorge! Coffee makers in the room were a lovely perq, but it was a little jarring to read that we would have to pay for an additional coffee pod. Overall a serviceable hotel, nice staff, pretty lobby in a good location."
5,Excellent service and stay!,"All staff, from the folks at the front desk, housekeeping, in-room dining calls and delivery and many others at the hotel go above and beyond and made my stay at the hotel fantastic! I want to also share that the front desk and building engineering also were amazing when I needed some medical attention. I was traveling alone and flew into Austin on Saturday for a business trip. The next morning, I woke up and was unable to walk without falling - the room spinning and I was nauseous. I had crawled to get my cellphone, called a friend who then called the front desk. Within minutes, the staff was in my room, calming me and ensuring that I was going to be ok and that an ambulance was on its way. I was later diagnosed as vertigo and discharged from the hospital. I was able to finish my business trip and had a great experience at the hotel thanks to the wonderful men and women who work there. The city was great and I would highly recommend the Westin Austin Downtown if you are planning a visit to Austin."
5,Business Meeting in Austin,"We conducted a year-end meeting at the Westin Austin Downtown Hotel. All the hotel services were awesome. My special thanks to the Catering and AV professionals exceeding all expectations.. Joel from AV had his staff ready for any immediate needs (planned or not). We enjoyed breakfast, snacks and lunch from their menu offerings. I have to say, without a doubt, ""The Best"" we have had at such a meeting, especially with 20 people. It was a huge variety each day, well presented, and tasted amazing! Special thanks to Monica for providing soup (off Menu) for an attendee not feeling well. The whole time, we felt we were the only client there. Thanks so much for your personal services!!"
5,"Great Stay, Great Town","Central Location, Walking distance to Great Food and Fun music. Hotel was very clean and staff always helpful. The rooftop pool was closed, but then it was November! Weather went from Sunny and new high of 88 deg. to Rainy and woke up to 49 degrees. !"
3,NOT Texas Top Ten!,"This hotel boasts Conde Nast ""Top 10 Hotels in Texas,"" so we decided to try it. We made our reservation in May for a November 2 night stay at a prime $400 per night rate. We assumed we would be given a great room.We arrived around 5:00 pm and were given a room at the end of the hall overlooking the roof a/c units. It was a tiny, ugly room. Since it was unacceptable, we were moved to a room with Queen beds that had a better view. Still, given the reservation had been made 6 months before our stay, this was disappointing. I would bet that the hotel had not been sold out when we originally made and paid for the reservation.This hotel is supposed to be ""new."" While it is perhaps updated, it is very old with dated molding, Mr Coffeemakers in the rooms (nowadays nice hotels usually have Nepresso or Kuerig machines). It was very basic, not at all luxury.The thing that was the WORST was the housekeeping services. Our first night we had wine and food in the room. When we checked out two days later, the trash and wine glasses had not been cleaned or removed! The pile of towels in the shower should indicate that we want new towels. The housekeepers dropped new towels on the bed, yet did not remove the pile of dirty towels. I was amazed at the lack of attention to detail, and it made me worry other things had not been cleaned properly. The beds and sheets were crisp and fresh.For the price, and for the booming Austin market, there are far better choices."
5,Modern and close to everything,"Modern, clean hotel typical of Westin brand. Close to everything and yet a block or 2 away from the very busy areas (6th st for instance).6th st with its festivities can get very loud on the weekend. Managed to walk to the river and even to South Congress a 30 min walk. Special shout out to Alena at the front desk for her thoughtful and courteous guidance"
5,Ryan Cooper Stay,"From my first encounter with Minh, to Taylor being more than helpful with helping me find fun and exciting things to do. Along with the great individuals working the bar up by the pool. Everyone there were more than accommodating and friendly. When I make it back to Austin, TX I know where I'll be staying again."
5,Perfectly Comfortable & Perfectly Located,"My wife and I loved our stay here. We were in town for a concert and this was the perfect location. Just a block off 6th Street and within walking distance of everything we were in town for. Clean, modern, comfortable, friendly, helpful - everything positive you can say is not overdoing it. We'll be back!"
5,excellent perfect locations,"Jorge from front desk went above and beyond, making excelled recommendations . His professionalism and enthusiasm were amazing.we can wait to go back...everything was walking distance from hotel.it exceeded our exceptionsvery clean and the view was breath taking...Martha"
5,Excellent Hotel in Perfect Location,"I stayed here for a business conference and was very pleased with the hotel accommodations. The room was lovely and the fitness center is very nice. There is also a rooftop pool and bar. The front desk staff were extremely nice and helpful. The location is perfect, around the corner from 6th Street which is the popular bar spot. The hotel is also very close to an amazing running trail along the river. I would definitely stay here again."
5,Second visit in a month!,"Can't say enough good things about the Westin Austin Downtown! We are staying here for the second time in a month - which is really saying something. Jorge F at the front desk is an absolute gem. He makes everyone feel like this is their home away from home. His warmth and enthusiasm are unparalleled. Jorge lights up the lobby with a smile and is always there to help with anything we have needed, from a late night snack recommendation to a thank you card. Stella San Jac is an uncommonly good hotel restaurant with an eclectic selection of nicely prepared dishes. Location is perfect for pretty much anything you want to do downtown, from restaurants to bars to music venues to meeting spaces. Rooms are fairly spacious, beds are comfy, and the showers are ah-mazing (ooohhh, the showers!). Hotel decor is contemporary without being cold - a nice juxtaposition of Texas hospitality and modern culture. If you need a centrally located hotel where everyone will treat you like family, you can't go wrong with the Westin Texas Downtown!"
5,Workout Gear Lending really works well,I used the Westin/New Balance gear lending program and it worked like a charm. I got brand new New Balance tennis shoes to walk around the city of Austin since I didn’t have room in my carry-on luggage to pack my personal tennis shoes. Staff was very accommodating to make this happen! Thank you!
5,"Excellent, excellent! Must experience","Jorge was a great host and took care of me, my guys, and a lot of guest truly loved him, including us! The food was great, in room dinning is awesome, rooftop pool and bar was nice, and a great view, rooms were PERFECT, like JORGE!"
5,The best.,"Wow. So much fun. Wouldn't see stay anywhere else. Jorge is the best! No better place to stay for 6th street shenigans. Happy 2018!. The rooftop bar is great, dont miss it. Keep Austin crazy ain't a better place to stay."
5,Plenty of water,"Hotel was very nice, staff exceptional. Austin was under a boil water order the whole time I was there, hotel provided more than an ample supply of bottled water; no inconvenience at all for guests while it must have been a nightmare for staff. Well done!"
1,Disappointing stay,"I stay in many Westins around the world and this was the worst by a long way. Over familiar staff; absence of staff to help with parking, luggage and check in when arriving after 10pm; lectured by front desk staff when i dared say that I wasn't happy with my stay; poor attention to detail as things missing from room service and no laundry service at the weekend which is not mentioned on the laundry list. Revolting stewed coffee at breakfast - even at 7.00am. Old soft pillows and uncomfortable bed. The whole place felt very shabby. I will not be staying here again and will not recommend it. A huge disappointment when Westins are normally a haven"
3,Lovely Hotel but Service Inconsistent,"Stayed at the Westin Austin Downtown over Grand Prix weekend. A new, modern hotel in the heart of Austin. Greeted, or not greeted by the Valet and upon asking what were the parking options was told ""This is it!"" Went into check-in and treated like an annoyance - No recognition of loyalty...essentially, we should be fortunate to stay here as the Hotel is full...seriously, it was Grand Prix weekend after all - The front Desk agent wasn't doing us a favor for letting us stay at the Hotel. Was put in a room that was designated ADA without being told so. The Front Desk Manager called and reminded us that we were put on a higher floor after all...Again, seriously! Had diner at Stella - Very nice! Departed early this morning and of course was charged for an extra day valet parking which under the circumstances, seemed par for the course and upon departure, asking the valet person a question, he answered us without looking up even just a little and kept his head buried in his cell phone. Rude and therefore, the inconsistent service experience, beginning to end."
5,Great location and hospitality,The Westin downtown has a great location. Best rooftop pool and facilities and friendly staff. TyQuan was a highlight of the friendly experience helped with all my questions and great suggestions on where to go. Will be back 100%
1,BEWARE! THIS HOTEL OVERBOOKS...YOU MAY GET BOUNCED!,"We had a CONFIRMED , non-refundable room with Surge pricing due to ACL and Longhorn home game....but on the way to check in at 6:15pm, we were told our reservation was moved to another hotel due to the Westin ""overcommitted"" !How is it that if I had backed out, I would have been out $468.88 (yes, one night price with fees due to surge pricing for busy weekend) yet they can back out on me??? The 4 star Westin thought it was fair to move me to a 3 star, much cheaper hotel. We CHOSE the Westin, but due to their bad business, we were turned away. We were racing the clock to be showered and dressed for a dinner event across the street (the main reason we chose this hotel) and now we had no room there. Instead of allowing this hotel to move us to an inferior hotel , we chose to move on the Four Seasons, who graciously welcomed us. FOUR SEASONS WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY! SHAME ON YOU, WESTIN, SHAME ON YOU , MARRIOT/SPG GROUP!"
5,Great hotel with great people,"The Austin Westin is a wonderful property. Great location within walking distance to many restaurants with clean, fresh rooms and the folks working there are so hospitable!! Had a great stay and will stay there again when I return to Austin!"
5,Solid. Nice,Great stuff all around for corporate sales meeting 150 people. Solid restaurant s an pool and location idealWorkout facility was good. Great service. I forgot my toiletries bag and they provided everything free of charge
5,Almost Perfect,"The hotel is beautiful and the service is amazing! The only annoying thing was the lack of On Demand movies, which was only a problem for our teen son because the rooftop pool became a rooftop bar, which excluded him from being able to swim on Friday night. But everything else was perfect!! Next time we’ll bring a laptop if we want to watch a movie."
5,ACL!,Me and a few girlfriends went for the weekend for ACL and had an amazing time! We were at the festival most of the time but when we returned we were welcomed by friendly staff and tacos! We will be back next year!
5,Snack Bar,"There is a snack bar in the lobby that is open late, and it has a great variety of snacks: ice cream, tacos, candy, and so much more! We were helped by Jorge, who is so sweet and so kind. Great hospitality and service!"
3,High End but....,"We really like hotel and amenities but make sure you either ask for a room away from the music district. We were on the 12th floor and the 6th street music and bar scene filled our room. Had to request earplugs. And they KNEW this was an issue. It is very centrally located and it is a hopping area, but I would ask for the quiet side"
4,Oct business trip,"The service people were so nice and very competent. The hotel property was quite pleasant, although the music from a nearby club, though, made sleep a challenge. Room service breakfast and dinner were delicious but the salad I had a lunch in the restaurant was not so good. I would stay here again, though, simply because the people were so nice."
3,"Pet friendly, excellent breakfast","This Westin is very pet friendly, and even has pet treats out in the lobby!WeekEnd brunch was really nice, the fresh pressed juices were amazing.Rooftop pool is a bit small, but with great view of the city.Not getting a better review because:1) service was just ok, asked for the room to be made, but 4 hrs later we still didn’t get our room serviced2) from time to time, we smell something weird in the room coming through he air vent, like sewer or something like that, really unpleasant!3)staff at roof top pool was rudeOther than that everything else is just like a standard Westin."
5,Nice!,"Very nice hotel with an awesome pool on the rooftop. Stayed here for business and all of the staff were very accommodating. They do an awesome job cleaning the rooms, even lined up my shoes. Nice bar in the hotel as well as one on the rooftop. No complaints"
2,Disappointed,"Upon arrival, we were received with news our room was not ready, nor any room for that matter. They did offer a $50 coupon for use in their restaurant while we waited for about thirty minutes. Once we unpacked we discovered the pool is not kid friendly, the fridge was not really cooling, housekeeping did not restock all the amenities completely."
5,ACL Stay,"Excellent hotel for ACL weekend, walking distance to shuttles and convenient to downtown activities.Stayed here multiple years, consistent service. Stell San Jac has late night bites Fri and Sat nights"
4,Business Trip to the great city of Austin,"I was in town for a conference and stayed at the Westin in Downtown Austin for 4 nights. My check-in was smooth and speedy. I went to my room and loved it. It was so clean, and I loved the rain shower. I also loved the soft bed and pillows. The daily maid service was great. The restaurant in the hotel is incredible.The only down side of this hotel is the roof-top pool. It is beyond crowded and you can't even get a seat to sit near the pool or anywhere in that area. The pool itself was filled with so many people I worried how clean it would be. I have a photo as part of this review to show how crowded it was. We decided not to stay at the pool due to the crowds and how dirty the water might be. Later that week during our stay we decided to try to take an evening/night-time swim, figuring it would be less busy. It was not as busy, but the lights that illuminated the pool water showed a murky (at best) water so we again decided not to enjoy the pool (aka cesspool). I have stayed at many hotels and this is by far the worst pool I've ever seen. It's too bad, as everything else about this hotel is amazing."
5,"Great Stay, Great place to host event","I stayed and hosted an event at the Westin Austin Downtown Property. Experience from beginning to end was exceptional. I loved how modern the hotel decoration and style was. Loved my room location - far end of the hall. Loved my room - bed was very comfortable. Working with catering team for the event hosted in the hotel was fantastic. Great communication from beginning to end. Enjoyed working with Charlotte, Joel, and Claire - they made it easy. Plus, their on-site team working during the event did a great job with set-up and service. Would highly recommend this location as it a central space to 6th street, and other favorite Dowtown Austin locations. Felt central to things especially since I did not rent a car to get around. I either walked or took a Lyft, which was good for me, because I have challenges walking long distances."
4,Out of town wedding,"Very nice hotel in great location downtown. Big comfortaable room with great view. Only downside was front desk, which completely botched the billing using reward points. Took about a month to get it cleared up."
5,Westin,Went to the Westin hotel to celebrate my friends 30th birthday. Was blown away with how amazing this hotel was. The service was outstanding and let’s not forget about the restaurant Stella San Jac which has a great food selection. We ended the weekend off at the rooftop bar Azul which gives you the best views of downtown Austin. I definitely see myself coming back here in the near future.
5,Westin,I attended Westin for one of there pool parties!! It was amazing the drinks the food the musics everything! I highly recommend extending your stay if you have the opportunity! I will be back for more 🌴👯‍♀️🍾🙌🏼💕😁
5,Classy Hotel with Killer City Views,I felt the style of the Westin as soon as I walked through the lobby. It’s very clean and up-to-date on all the decor. My room (702) has THE best city views! The service was outstanding and the housekeeping left thoughtful touches. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. Oh! It’s also walkable to pretty much anywhere downtown!
5,"Lovely hotel, good location","The Westin is downtown on 5th, just a block from 6th where there are lots of music venues. It's a lovely hotel and the room was excellent, large, immaculate and quiet. There is a good gym and a rooftop pool and bar. The front desk checked in with me by cell phone message several times to see how my visit was going and whether they could do anything for me. That was a nice touch. Everyone was friendly and attentive."
5,Westin Austin Downtown business meeting,Excellent location in the heart of Austin with plenty of restaurants and activities within easy walking distance. The rooftop pool is incredible. Don't miss the Museum of the Weird and watch the bats come out at dusk from the Congress Avenue bridge. I also recommend the Segway tour of Austin.
5,Great Place,This was by far the nicest hotel we’ve stayed in. The rooms were spacious and had a great view of the city. The food and service was great. The rooftop pool and bar was an added bonus and a great time.
5,Azul Rooftop,Myself and a couple guys went to the pool party one afternoon and boy did it not disappoint! They brought it a DJ and we’re playing fire jams. The hospitality was also superb. Nick and staff (Vivian and Julia) were so great to us. Always there when you needed them but also not hovering or trying to sell you the most expense things.Would go back a again in a heart beat and will be sending any friends that visit Austin to this place.Job well done!Brian
5,Great Service at a great hotel,Me and friends visited the Westin yesterday and spent the whole day there. Great service from all staff in a very nicely modeled modern hotel. Food was with amazing and the rooftop views from the pool bar and lounge are the best in the city
3,Disappointed,"1 Disappointing ,starts with check in and from the off it went wrong got key to my room and walked in on a couple and it was not good opps 😳so got over that ,staff where very apologetic.2 filled out form for laundry same day service I went down to reception and asked for it to be picked up before 9 o’clock and of course I wake up next morning to find no laundry back ,rang down and person was rude and tried to say I had do not disturb on the door total lie eventually my stuff arrived ,late for work .Why no iron in room ?3. Rang down for room service ordered of the little drink and snack menu to be told they have no coke only Pepsi that they changed brand so then I asked for pringlesand sorry we don’t have them and she asked me are they on the menu .Order arrived and guess what they had Coca Cola bizarre behavior for a large hotel for staff not to know their jobs .4. Went to pay for rooms first room went through no problems and second room declined very embarrassing ,so I rang bank to see why and they said no issues with my card so went back to desk again and same issue ,girl recommended I go down to bank and see if they can help 1 hour later I came back bank told me it was hotel terminal issue not my card so I asked again the receptionist tried a different machine and it workedI found hotel to be in a great location food good pool area very nice but small and I can issues their if it was busy ,valet parking great"
4,Beautiful Hotel,"Hotel is beautiful, and has an excellent location right between 5th and 6th, walking distance to all the funCons:Valet parking is your only good option. No free parking in the areadownstairs bar/ restaurant does not give any additional perks to guests of the hotel."
3,Good location but expect more from a Westin,Right in the middle of downtown and close to everything which was great. But was to relax and watch a movie and couldn’t. Felt you would get a lot more luxury for the cost compared to other hotels at a similar price
5,Amazing staff!,"The staff were super-friendly, enthusiastic, and efficient! Particular thanks to the following hotel employees: Jorge, Taylor (Front Desk), Mathew, Brian (Bell Desk), Jess (Stella Restaurant). Rooms, lobby, and hallways alike were luxurious, bed was amazingly comfy, and the shower setup was amazing.Regarding the food at the Stella Restaurant, the Chicken & Waffle were delicious (rivalling Hollywood's famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, which is sacrilegious for a former L.A. resident like me to say, heh heh heh), and my girlfriend thought the scrambled eggs were THE best she's ever had anywhere!"
5,This is a fantastic place to stay,"The people here treat you like a King or Queen. They not only help you when you ask them for assistance, but the go out of their way to give you what you need or want. Why stay any other place when they have people like JORGE? We needed a little more time in our room due to a flight delay. The people at the W were more than happy to extend our time. It may not have been a big deal to them, but it really made things easier for us. Did I mention that JORGE was fantastic?"
5,Awesome,"Awesome room, pool, and meeting rooms. The room was clean and everything worked well. The meeting rooms were spacious and temperatures were good. Front counter staff was very helpful and courteous. Great stay!"
5,Great property,We used points to stay at the property. Good location. We did not eat at the hotel. People were very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in earlier than the 3:00 pm check in time. The WIFI was great as well.
5,Great location and pool with mostly great staff,"Most of the staff here was very helpful and friendly. All service calls such as room service, extra towels, or general questions were fulfilled without issue. The rooftop pool is great for relaxing complete with service staff. On a holiday weekend it was busy and later in the evening a DJ was playing. Great spot if you are looking to cut loose. The security did their best to make sure it didn't get too crowded with random people coming in although they did ask us not to bring in outside food that we had actually ordered through our waitress which was kind of odd, but it was an honest mistake.Rooms were okay for a Westin. The location was excellent if you are looking to stay downtown.Room service did a great job cleaning but didn't empty our trash or recycling bins for some reason. Maybe we had too much trash, but I'm not sure. No complaints as overall the staff was great."
2,Horrible Pool,"The room was shabby. The gym was decent, but the “pool” is more of a roof top bath tub. It is about 3 feet deep and quite small. We had lunch and the food was ok, not great, but not awful. I would not stay here again."
5,The Perfect Downtown Austin Hotel,"From the second you walk in the Westin Austin Downtown you feel relaxed. Whatever fragrance they have pumping through the AC is unwinding and relaxing. I live in Austin but I feel like I'm on vacation with the gorgeous details, the aroma and customer service in this location. The heavenly bed was oh, so heavenly. I slept well, ate well and lived well. You're able to walk to almost all downtown attractions, given the heat of the summer. The fall would be even easier to walk to spots a little further out. From the rooftop pool you can see the best view of Austin, only lacking the Capital Building. Town Lake, downtown, Congress, Frost Tower, Barton Springs, everything from this one spot on the 20th floor. Probably one of the best pools in downtown. The gym... Incredible. TVs on the machines, ice-cold after-workout towels, apples for an after-workout snack, and headphones for everyone. They even provide workout clothes for a small fee. (Less packing, what?!) Stella San Jac was fantastic, room service from the restaurant is equally as good and every little detail made it a wonderful stay!"
5,My best hotel experience this year!,"Great location and amenities. Restaurant was fabulous. Food service and quality during the conference was exceptional. Room was fantastic, great shower, heavenly bed gigantic room, beautiful TV monitor, fast internet. I couldn't ask for more. Staff was fantastic - Samuel was particularly helpful."
3,"Ehhh, but great food and great service",A 200 hundred chareacter minimum is a great idea as it will help sell your service with my time and efforts. I like your approach in the sense that you absolutely are offing nothing in return. Sounds like we are off to a great start or a fanatastivally meaniful replatiinship
5,Tax Resolution,"Nice location and service. The food and drinks from Stella restaurant were excellent. The seminar rooms were clean, great temperature and good illumination. The elevator controls in place made me feel secured."
5,Great Hotel; Even Better Breakfast!,"Over the years, I have stayed in several Westin's and they never disappoint; this one was no different. Friendly staff, great valet service, and clean, comfortable rooms. The one thing that made this Westin stand out was the amazing breakfast; definitely don't want to miss it. I tried everything from the lemon/banana child pancakes, to the avocado toast, to their one-of-a-kind hash browns. You can not go wrong with anything off their menu. The restaurant service was quick and very friendly. We will definitely be staying here again!"
4,Hip Hotel!,"Nice Happening Hotel, but quiet at the same time! We were concerned about party people but the hotel was quiet and the rooms have double pane windows! Many restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance to hotel!"
5,The Best Concierge in Town,"My buddies and I were on the fence about what we should do for our final night in Austin (celebrating a bachelor party). We were invited to a rooftop pool party at the Westin one evening and our group was divided on whether or not we should pay to attend. We didn't know where to turn but luckily, we ran into Taylor at the Concierge. We weren't even guests at the hotel and she treated us like VIPs. She took the time to really understand our situation, personalities, and preferences before setting us up with an incredible evening itinerary and making reservations for our group at one of the hottest cocktail bars in town. We had an epic night and the entire group agreed that it was the best way to end the trip. I'd like to think that other concierges would have pushed their own event/pool party, but not Taylor - she's simply the best and a big reason why I'll be staying at (and highly recommending) the Westin for future visits."
1,disappointing,"When check in to room the Small Refrigerator did not work and had to be replace. I slipped, hit my head and back. No small bath towels the following morning. Room was not clean property the next morning"
2,Additional charges added to your bill,"Great location, great that is pet friendly (which is why I stayed), AMAZING at adding additional charges to your bill that you did not charge from the restaurant!! At check out told the front desk that was not my charge and stated she would adjusted, but that they were going to look into it. If it stands that they would charge me at a later date, which they did. Now I’m trying to dispute a $51 charge to my bill that I did not spent on San Jac restaurant (an ok restaurant) and I’m just now getting the run around! But y’all are so damn quick to call me when I step out to walk to the convenience store a few blocks away, to tell me that my dogs are barking and I needed to return immediately!! Yes, travelers you can take your dog but you can not leave your dog unattended at any given point, even if your on the hotel premises! DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BANK ACCOUNT A FEW DAYS AFTER CHECKOUT!"
5,excellent location!,"The Westin was in an excellent location, able to walk to all the entertainment. The beds are amazing,so comfortable, I slept like a baby. Loved the lavender oil to help me relax, a nice touch. Would definitely stay again!"
5,Mother/Daughter weekend get away,"Brought my daughter to Austin (and Waco for Fixer Upper's Magnolia Market) for her 21st birthday and we truly enjoyed the city. We met a great door man (forgot his name but from South Plainfield NJ) who was super friendly, helpful, and checked in with us every time we came back to the hotel from exploring. Taylor the concierge was also a great help with advice."
5,My home in Austin,"I've had the privilege to stay at the Westin about 4 times now, i loved every stay. This hotel is probably my favorite hotel in the world. When you walk in you smell roses in the lobby this particular smell floats around and follows you to the room. Dave the front desk clerk is kind and informative. The AZUL rooftop is the place to be at, the beautiful view and the awesome music, we made some friends and even befriended the DJ who treated us to a few drinks. The shower in the room is my favorite and somehow i never manage to find even a grain of dirt. Truly, my favorite place."
5,Exceptional service in a perfect location,"Very impressed with everyone at The Westin Austin. I wish I could remember everyones names. We booked the room for Austin Pride.My friend and roommate for the weekend is on crutches and we requested an accessible room when I made the reservation. We we arrived the front desk person upgraded us to higher floor and certainly didn't notice my friend who was standing away from us. I forgot to confirm it was also accessible. It had a terrifc view and a walk in shower in a very big bathroom. We thought we could make it work but the shower was too difficult for my friend without a bench. So we asked to change rooms on our way our for dinner. The lady at the front desk was super nice, checked to see that there were accessible rooms available, and told us we could switch when we got back. We assumed we'd be sent back to a much lower floor. When we got back, she sent us up to gather our stuff and wait for a bellman to come. Bryce arrived a few moments later with keys to our room. We were in a even better room on a higher floor! What a pleasant surprize.Our entire experience was similar to this. We loved the rooftop pool and bar. The customer service here is truly exceptional in every aspect. Bryce even continued to greet us when we'd see him coming in and out. He was so friendly we'd come back just see him. Love this place!"
5,"Clean, comfortable, hip & great location","Love this hotel and for the money, can't be beat! Great location in downtown Austin. You can walk every where. The rooms are spacious, modern and clean. The service is friendly and the restaurant downstairs is good too. The rooftop is also fun. Love it and highly recommend it when needing an affordable, higher end hotel in downtown Austin."
5,Location location location,Very nice and modern hotel with rooftop pool and bar. Pool is small and very crowded on a Saturday afternoon when 100 degree is outside. The rooms are nice size with modern look. The bed is firm with too many soft pillows. Everything worked. Location is a block away from 6 street.
2,Not kid friendly,"We recently stayed two nights in Austin with our kids, 13, 17, and 19, the hotel isn’t for kids even on the older side. The roof top swimming pool is open to the public and after 6 pm turns into a club scene. Because of the pool being open to the public this allows them acesss to the elevators and all floors of the hotel. Needless to say we saw many females in next to nothing bath suits walking through the hotel lobby. Getting an open elevator was difficult and most often filled with highly intoxicated people with no regard to who else was in the elevator. We were on a floor under the pool and were kept awake by the music that was being played. Not to mention the intoxicated people through the hallways. Very disappointing to say the least."
2,Terrible customer staff,The front desk clerk was not friendly and she did not have a clue how to get the information needed. The beds were not comfortable it felt as if I were sleeping ona Rock. This is my first and last stay at the Westin.
5,"Great hotel, great location, and dog friendly!","This was an extremely hip hotel in a very hip town. The location was great, right near all of the downtown nightlife and attractions. It definitely caters to the party crowd. Lots of bachelor/bachelorette parties, so the lobby was extremely noisy in the evening, but our room was on a higher floor and was very quiet. Nearest patch of grass for the dog was only a block away, which was convenient. The running/walking path around Lady Bird Lake / Colorado river was also about a half mile or less from the hotel which was convenient. Get a room on a high floor if you are looking for a low-key stay in Austin. They had a social running program, but we did not try it when we were there. Valet parking only, which is a hassle when you are moving cross-country and have a ridiculous amount of stuff :), but not an issue if you flew into town and plan to walk/uber everywhere."
5,Great Stay.,"We stayed for a long weekend in July. The hotel is great- loved the decor, and the room was super clean. We were on the 11th floor overlooking 6th street and had no problem with noise from the bars. The restaurant was great too, I recommend the smoked chicken sandwich."
4,"Nice, clean hotel","The room, accommodations were very nice. Room was very clean. The rooftop pool was very small and crowded, very disappointing! Loud people partying it up, just gross gross gross. The conference room facilities was exceptional."
2,Bathroom Doors,Everything here is fine. Except for the guestroom bathroom doors. I can live with the fact that they are semi-translucscent and light up the entire room in the middle of the night. I can live with them being sliding doors that might cause minor limb damage when slammed since there's no safety dampening mechanism. But I can't live with with the fact that they DO NOT LOCK. It's equally disturbing that the door seems to have a 1 inch gap all the way around perimeter of the door. The bathroom is a private place where private thinks happen. I'd be horrified to have to share this double queen with anyone other then my significant other. And even then... And the cherry on top; there's no excaust fan.
1,Not happy,I came here with a group of girls for a bachlorette. We are really disappointed with the low quality of upkeep with the rooms. After 2 days we had to call and ask for someone to take out our trash and give us fresh towels. When we asked holly at the front desk gave us a hard time saying “we give you enough for your guests”. It’s 5 girls in 103 degree weather we take a few showers. The maids came were very nasty gave us towels and left. They never came back to refresh the room the whole trip! The front desk didn’t really care because nothing was fixed after we complained. For this money we deserve better service
5,Great Hotel!,This hotel was very comfortable and the hotel staff was great! There was even a nice smell throughout the whole hotel. I thought it was nice that the pool on the 20th floor was open to the public on Sunday Funday!
4,A Pleasant Stay,"Staff at the Westin are polite, helpful and provide welcoming attitude. I enjoyed the gym at the end of the day; clean, with equipment to suit any need while staying at the hotel. The meeting/conference room was an appropriate size and met the needs perfectly for the number of attendees. I enjoyed the location; it lent itself to walking distance for many of the activities happening in downtown Austin.My only drawback is a microwave not provided in the room. The great dining experience in downtown Austin can leave a person with more than he/she can enjoy resulting in a to-go bag. The person is in no position to bring a late-night snack back from their dining because they are not able to re-heat and enjoy. I understand this is not a usual concern and that is why I have no heartburn about not having the microwave. This is only a minor mention if that. The experience at The Westin was nice and I look forward to any future conference we have being held at your hotel."
5,👍👍 Talk to Taylor when booking!! 👍👍,"Had a last minute trip to Austin, so, naturally came to Trip Advisor to look at reviews/availability.Choosing Westin downtown was definitely the way to go. Walking in I met with a professional, yet very personable front office attendant— Taylor, who basically went above and beyond to make sure everything was taken care of and to my liking. She was very knowledgeable with the city, giving several options to choose from with venues and restaurants around the area.The pool upstairs was great, room service was excellent, and even when checking out, Taylor remembered who I was... asked if the options she’d given were helpful (which, she was spot on), and how my stay was; something you SHOULD expect at a high-end hotel.So kudos to her, and the Westin downtown. I’ll definitely be staying there again, and recommend to friends who plan on traveling to Austin."
5,"Fun, hip hotel","Loved staying here for a weekend in Austin. The rooftop pool is great, although they are really trying to do a whole Las Vegas pool party with a DJ and everything in the afternoons and evenings which is fun but a little awkward when there are children already playing in the pool. Despite this it's a fun spot."
5,Fantastic hotel,"Location is very good. Our room was on the top floor, overlooking 6th street. Incredible view. Beds were very comfortable and clean. Everything was clean, worked, and convenient. This is why we’re SPG members. We slept better here than we do at home. Great hotel. Oh, but $42 to park kind of sucks. Get ready for that."
3,Wanted to Love it,"I was at this hotel for a conference. The facilities are great and honestly the best hotel food I have ever had. The amenities and staff were superb. Set your expectations though, the hotel is near 6th st. Despite being on the 17th floor, I felt like I was in a club all week, the music was so loud below.One of the features I was most excited for was the pool. I imagined enjoying a nice book by the pool and relaxing. I was there for 5 nights and every day it was like Spring Break in Cancun up there. Very drunk people and very loud music.If you are going to for a party weekend, this would be the perfect spot. If looking for something relaxing, professional or family friendly, I would recommend heading downtown."
4,Great service,"Located in downtown, only two blocks from the major street called ""Congress""My stay was pleasant, the service is impeccable.The only thing is that the toilet flush doesn't work quite well, you had to press harder and longer for it to work. Room 1029."
5,Honeymoon,Thank u Jorge u were so awesome with getting us just what we needed for our weekend stay. Everything was so great. I'm in hopes of returning for our anniversary. Although the pool was awfully small it was a glorious view.
5,Great Stay at the Austin Westin,My wife and I recently stayed at the Austin Westin and it was a great place to stay. The location of the hotel was perfect for our trip and conveniently located for what we wanted to do. The hotel was clean and orderly for our entire stay. I would like to call out the exceptional service provided by Taylor at the front desk. She went out of her way to recommend things to do and places to eat and she was spot on for everyone of them. Service like that makes a trip so much more enjoyable and did not go unnoticed. Special thanks to her.
5,Customer service that really wows!,"This hotel is beautiful and has incredible views. Moreover, the food is delish, the service is outstanding and the rooms are well equipped for business travelers. I hope I get the chance to visit this hotel again soon."
3,"Great location, friendly people, busy and loud!","Stayed here for an office trip. Valet and check in speedy and friendly. Rooms were great, comfy beds, clean. Fridge, coffee maker, iron, water provided. Breakfast at Stella was wonderful, they call it brunch but opened at 7 on Saturday. The only cons to this place are 1. Very crowded. 2. If you have kids that want to swim, the adults have taken over the pool. Rooftop area small and crowded. The location of the hotelIs awesome, however some rooms that face 6th Street are very loud at night."
5,"Friendly, attentive staff, convenient location","This hotel is beautiful and located near many restaurants, food trucks and bars. The staff is so friendly, welcoming and ready to help. Rooms are quite spacious for a downtown hotel, with a large bathroom. Beds are comfortable as well and the room is equipped with a refrigerator."
5,The hotel was wonderful - but Jorge was the best!,"I attended a work conference July 11-July 13, and the hotel was incredible. Beautiful lobby, immaculate room (and having worked at a hotel previously, I'm pretty hard to impress), and excellent service. However, Jorge was the cherry on top of a perfect stay. Excellent customer service is pretty rare these days, and he was an absolute gem. I felt welcomed the moment I entered the hotel, and even though there was another person behind me in line, he didn't rush me and took the time to show me a few features of the hotel (the conference screen in the lobby and pointed out where the amenities were). And it didn't stop there - every time I (or our group) came back through the lobby, he greeted us and made sure to see if we were still doing okay. Truly, I cannot say enough good things about Jorge and the Westin in general. The rooftop bar was incredible, and even the workout facility was nice. I couldn't have asked for a better experience!"
5,"Great location, comfortable beds","The location is great, one block away from live music on Sixth Street. It is also very close to the convention center and well as the famous bat viewing bridge. I didn't make it there but it is also close to the state capitol building.The rooms were nice, the beds and linens are super comfy.The walls are pretty thin, one night the room adjacent partied until 2AM."
4,Stylish and great location,"This hotel is very nice and modern. The beds are comfortable. They have a great breakfast place attached to the hotel. My only annoyance with it was that they allow dogs (which I am a fan of), but there was a dog on my floor that seemed to be outside my door that wouldn't stop barking. I called down to the front desk as I was trying to get some sleep prior to an early wake up the next day. Basically the whole ordeal took 1-2 hours to fix, and I was granted some Starwood points, and a free breakfast for the ordeal. I didn't really feel this was a fair trade as the one thing you want when you get into a city late at night is to be able to go to sleep peacefully, but I'm glad they offered something for the inconvenice."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to staying at the Westin Austin downtown, but was very disappointed. The noise from 6th street kept me up until the early hours of the morning, the highly touted rooftop pool was so crowded there was no where to sit and I was charged an additional night when called away for a family emergency for not giving 48 hours notice. As a Gold SPG member, I would have expected better from the Westin."
1,"Don’t bring your swim suits, bring ear plugs","Every day the beautiful rooftop pool is used by crowds of college kids, you can go swimming at 7 AM & miss that crowd, but forget about using the pool to relax after an afternoon of sightseeing, hotel does not alert you to this. If I had children I definitely WOULD NOT use this hotel. Plus crowds of college kids running through lobby, using the lounge and it’s apparently a hot spot for bachelor and bachelorette parties. LOUD!! The food in restaurant was great and we loved our room but the customer service by hotel is limited to helping alleviate the problem of pool use. I would definitely not come back to this hotel and since this was a daily occurrence during our 5 day stay it really soured me on Austin. I was so looking forward to this first time trip but alas I will be looking for somewhere else to vacation."
5,Great Service,"I was at the Westin for one night, but it was enough to impress. The service was impeccable, from checkin, where I was greeted close to midnight with cheer and helpfulness, to a 1am request for toothpaste, to an amazing breakfast.Also, the location is great for enjoying Austin's nightlife."
4,Great 7 days at Downtwon Austin,"I stayed over at the Westin Downtwon Austin between 23 June to 29 June. I was travelling from Singapore. Due to bad delays I only got in at 10pm after a 30 hour journey and the lady at the counter was kind enough to upgrade my room.Casey (the manager) was also kind to help merge my two bookings into one. Jorge at the front desk was amazing too and was super clear with his explanations. Loved the Stella and the folks there were amazing.If you love to run, get the running map. Some amazing running routes along the river. I really don't have that much complaints re this place. Only bad experience was on my first night when there were a few drunk kids sitting along the hallway and being rowdy at night when I was trying to sleep after the long travel.Probably one of the coolest Westin hotels I have stayed at. Thank you for the hospitality Casey and team."
5,"Beautiful Hotel, Fantastic Location",I loved everything about this hotel. But our favorite part was the wonderful gal who helped us check in and told us about some amazing restaurants to try. These places she recommended served some of the best food we have ever eaten in our LIVES.
4,"Great Hotel, Questionable Pool","We have stayed at the Westin a few times and enjoy everything about it except the pool. Everyone is extremely helpful, and the hotel is located centrally downtown. The rooms are nice, and quiet. It seems however, depending on your preference, you may love or hate the pool. It is so very small with no shade. There are cabanas available for rent, but no lounge chairs with shade. The hotel allows day passes to the pool and bar area, and it becomes a very loud party quickly. We will stay at the Westin again, but we will not plan on using the pool area."
5,Jorge is AMAZING!,"From the moment we stepped in the door until the second we left, Jorge continuously went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. Not only was Jorge amazing, the rooftop pool was definitely worth the stay. We will definitely be staying here again in the future."
5,Great stay,"We had a fantastic stay here. Ricardo Moreno, Jorge, Holly, and Olivia took great care of us during our trip. The room was nice and clean, the decor was beautiful, and the people are nice. We stayed at a different hotel the fiest night, and I wish we would have stayed here both nights. The pool/bar is pretty busy and fun."
5,Anniversary night,I want to give a special “Thank you” to JORGE FLORES at the front desk of the downtown Westin for turning a bad experience during reservation to a wonderful experience and memorable anniversary night at the Westin... He went out of his way to make our stay one that we will not forget ...I hope he will be recognized for his personable personality.. The hotel was an ideal pkace to stay after attending a very late show at Antone’s Blues club just across the street.
5,Very Happy with My Stay,"I had a wonderful time at the Westin. In particular I want to thank and call out that fact that when I filled out the online quick wiFi server in the lobby one morning I mentioned how much I like getting the slippers when I stay at Westins and that they were not in my room. I imagine maybe for cost savings reasons they are not standard any more? not sure.....but, what really surprised me when I came home from a long work day I found two set of slippers in my room that same evening. I did not expect that someone would read and respond to my survey so quickly. It made a very positive impression on me. Also the front desk staff was very welcoming. Thank your for a great stay."
5,First Time in Austin,"Great place to stay, everyone was friendly and very accommodating. First time in Austin and when we check in they asked what we were here for and ungraded up without hesitation. We appreciated all that they did for us! Their restaurant in the hotel was excellent"
3,Issue Resolution Issue Resolution Issue Resolution,"First I would like to stay that the hotel was nice, clean, and the staff was extremely accommodating. upon arrival our room was not available until 5:15 pm. To compensate for the lateness we received a drink voucher and also a lunch voucher, which was very nice and very delicious. Once in our room we realized the ceiling paint was peeling off and there was black in the grout. I mentioned this to the front desk and they immediately moved my room to another floor room of the same caliber. Because it was a Westin I did not expect these issues. The location was great to get to the conference center and restaurants."
5,Excellent staff and Great Location,"The Westin Austin Downtown has outstanding staff who will go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and comfortable. Thanks for the loaner umbrella during a particularly rainy week! The rooms are large and comfortable and come with robes, water, a mini fridge, other Westin standard comforts. During my first night, I did have some street noise so if you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a higher floor. The gym is well-equipped and well-attended with nice city views. The restaurant has a grab and go option as well as a full sit down menu. The bar is comfortable and there are ample drink and dinner options. The location is great—an easy walk to music, the state capital, shops, and galleries."
5,Amazing experience,My girlfriend and I stayed at the Westin downtown Austin and had an amazing experience with the help of Jorge!! He was filled with happy vibes and went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible. I highly recommend this hotel for any couple stays!
3,Pricey parking,"$40 overnight parking is crazy for Austin. Totally not worth it.No bathtub, standing shower only. Stained tiles.We only stayed one night didn’t get to experience the hotel much.Bed was comfortable and clean.Coffee maker was really cheap.It’s a good location and everything is a walking distance."
4,Great staycation,"Stayed overnight downtown but live in Austin. The location is great for access to many parts of downtown, within walking distance. Great service at the front desk, nice room, gym and pool/bar. Also enjoyed the restaurant in lobby."
5,Perfect Location in Downtown Austtin,The best part about this hotel is it's location to 6th Street and other local dining and nightlife that is all within walking distance. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean and spacious for a standard king room featuring bathrooms with walk in showers instead of the standard old tub showers. The shower was a little worn but not a deal breaker. Drinks at the hotel bar were delicious. Room service was relatively quick and the food was great. I would definitely stay here again!
5,Excellent stay!,The Westin Austin downtown is a top notch establishment. The minute I arrived I was greeted by the staff who were very attentive throughout the entire stay. The room and bathroom was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The onsite restaurant was very good. You can’t go wrong with the Westin Austin downtown!
5,Awesome - all details handled,"This place is really nice and everything is top notch which includes, food, service and the location. I had planned to walk everyday but forgot my shoes - no worries they have athletic shoes that they loaned me for free in women's size 11."
5,Just Seeing The Kids,"My wife and I love this hotel. From check in to exit our experience here has always been great! The hotel is beautiful over all and the lounge and pool area rooftop is a wonderful place to relax and hang out. We’ve always stay here on our trips to Austin and always will. We love the place, the service, and everything about the place."
4,Girls Weekend!,Booked 6 rooms. The staff had some issues with my reservations. I was always told something different. I had to keep coming back to the front desk to fix something they missed. Besides that all was good. Pool could use some daily cleaning.
5,Business Trip -Great location; well maintained and great staff.,Highly recommend this property. It is centrally located and walking distance from all major attractions. The property is very well kept. I was upgraded at check in and the higjer floor room provided amazing views of the city!
4,Great food,"Do not expect to use the pool if you have small children. It was like a nightclub with wall to wall bodies. And the music was deafening. I would like to point out 3 staff members that made this stay great/ Jorge at the front desk was so warm, helpful and inviting, Sage did a fantastic job serving our food, and Sophie who worked the coffee area in the morning, always had a great smile and attitude!!"
3,Plan To Spend Twice The Bucks You Expect To Spend,"The Westin is truly lovely and immaculate. It is also boring (it feels like the corporate hotel that it is) but clean, and the staff is friendly. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious.What the Westin Austin Downtown is NOT: it is NOT forthcoming regarding the parking situation. The website refers to the valet as an amenity, but what it really is, is a requirement. This hotel is VALET-ONLY, and nearly $50 (a day? Not sure, because I didn't do it, so be sure to ask...) You may not park your own car on the property unless you want to park in the street (3-hour max parking meters) or a garage/lot potentially blocks away. And what made it worse was that the curt little valet dude told me that if I didn't want to valet, I could park in the outside lot next door for $25, but that I would be charged every time I left the lot. That seemed like a fine deal to me since I had planned to Uber once I arrived in Austin anyway. So, I headed to the ""lot next door"" and it was $10 an hour. $60 for 12 hours. So, curt little valet dude, that means the parking would be closer to $100 for my brief one night stay at the Westin.Also, while the rooftop pool view was impressive, the pool is smaller than most backyard pools, and the Friday afternoon that I was there (FRIDAY, not Saturday or Sunday), there were about 30 people standing in it just drinking and hanging out, and another 50+ just partying. I realize that perhaps the hotel can't really do anything about it, but I did learn that there were a couple of huge bachelor/bachelorette parties happening, thus the boozy crowd. Just telling you so that you don't think you are going to be enjoying a peaceful swim, or a snooze on a hot Texas day. However, if you are in your early 20s and are in a fraternity or sorority, this is definitely the place to be.Austin is not representative of the rest of Texas.There are finer, prettier, cleaner, friendlier, easier-to-traverse cities in the Lone Star State. And for me, the Westin Downtown Austin will only receive my repeat business if there is not another room in the entire city."
5,Excellent stay,The hotel is kinda new and i loved it. My stay was so nice. The pool on the top is amazing. They let me check in early and when i got to the room later an amenity was set up. The best location. Definitely i will come back.
2,Worst weekend getaway,"The homeless problem in Austin is out of control. We were approached several times for money while eating breakfast at the hotel. The hotel staff never came to clean our room, and we were there for three nights. We had to find staff in the hallway for clean towels."
4,"Great Effort, Skip Memorial Day","I choose this hotel for two factors: SPG Properties, and the pool. I chose this hotel over other Austin properties because Westin really does have the best beds in the industry, the rate was decent, and they advertised a gorgeous rooftop pool.Unfortunately, the pool was revolting over Memorial Day - they sell day passes to locals (fine, I’ve stayed at plenty of W hotels, I know the drill). Unfortunately, in this instance, they sold 100+ day passes for a 45+ capacity pool. The pool was so crowded with thong wearing, gyrating, locals that it was literally impossible to step inside. The water was cloudy - chlamydia cloudy, not chlorine cloudy, and there wasn’t an inch of cement to drop a towel and room key. It was basically a state of nature.I turned around and left immediately (and I’ve been to Cancun over Spring break) just in time to look down and see the heartbroken little faces of children (and disgusted faces of their parents) who thought they were going to spend an afternoon at the pool only to discover they’d arrived at a dirty night club full of 23 year olds twerking and eating club sandwiches in the deep end.I curled up in my “Heavenly” bed with AC blasting, instead & read a book, and responded to the hotel survey.This is where Westin really tried to save the day. They read my survey response and immediately called to make it right. It’s hard to make it right when I chose your hotel for the pool and the pool has become a disgusting septic tank, but I appreciated the effort. They sent up wine, a have written note, and a tasty bowl of snacks - more than I expected and showing their best effort.I went back to the pool around 9 pm and the water was still thick & cloudy with humanity, the cement still coated in mystery slime, but the hordes had left, so I enjoyed a moment on the loungers.Would I come back, yes. Do I think they tried their best, yes. Do they need to prioritize hotel guest count over day-passers, Absolutely! Do they need to significantly reduce the number of day passes - even just for safety & hygiene sake, certainly. Would I ever return on Memorial Day or buy a pool day pass here? Never in a million years, I’d rather not spend a day at the CDC afterwards getting checked for water-born illnesses. Of course the last part is 40% hyperbole ... but ..."
5,Central location.,"Came for a Dave Mathews concert . The location is hard to beat . It’s close to all the bars on 6th street . Walking distance to most attractions , the bat bridge , the capital , lady bird lake . The food in Austin is great dint forget the food trucks some of the best"
2,"Poor service, poor customer care.","Checked in on Monday 05/21, the first room was not clean. Changed room with not excuses from reception manager or management. Used the laundry service. To get back my leaned cloths I needed to talk 4 times with the customer care. Asked for folded shirts in box, the shirts were returned on hangers."
5,Graduation weekend,"This is a beautiful hotel, nice rooms and decor. We ordered room service breakfast for 6:30-6:45 and we didn’t receive it until almost 7:00 which was the time we needed to leave. Needless to say we had to eat fast. BTW, the time we chose is their earliest. The excuse was they got too many orders for the same time. Just know if you have a time frame, you might need to re-think early breakfast."
2,The worst Westin I've ever stayed at,"I'm a fan of Westin in general, but I had an awful experience at this hotel. First of all that beautiful, relaxing looking pool in the brochure was quite the opposite. It felt like Spring Break in Florida with loud music, dozens of people in the pool drinking and yes on the weekend they put those armbands on guests using the pool. We were there for four nights and the hotel was filled with young, people who clearly liked to party and came in drunk and loud in the middle of the night waking us up. In addition, we had two packages delivered to the hotel. The first time I checked to ask if they had a package, the person at the front desk said it wasn't there. I tracked it and found out it had arrived and was signed for hours before. When I went back to the front desk, they finally tracked it down and said that this sometimes happens when the hotel gets busy. This happened again when a second package was delivered. 48 hours after the package was delivered, we still were not notified and had to track it down. The rooms at the hotel were fine, but our drain was clogged and some of the linens were cheaper and scratchier than I've had at other Westins. This Westin was a blight on the brand."
1,Hotel horror,"Found trash and food at bottom of pool, employees were an hour late cleaning pool. Found used women’s pad in restroom. Had black stain marks on pillow. Couldn’t go to pool with children due to adult nature on rooftop, nightclub."
1,Weekend in Austin,"This is probably one of the least relaxing hotel visits I have ever endured. Planned to spend the day by the beautiful pool, as depicted by the on line photos. The pool is tiny and cannot accommodate more than about 25 people, and that is a generous estimate. The only thing beautiful is the skyline, but two and three people thick trying to get a spot next to the sparse pool. So very disappointing. There are lovely covered seating areas around the pool, roped off, I assume for private rentals. This hotel should not even advertise as having a pool. Rooms are adequate, however beds are hard and sheets are crunchy. Very disappointed and will not be back."
3,"Excellent location, good service","Recommended by a friend for our first stay in Austin and I'm SPG Gold. Very easy 20 min. ride to/from the airport ($12-14 Lyft). Right in the center of downtown - great location to explore a lot of Austin. One block off of rowdy 6th Street.Check-in was a breeze, though I don't think they have much of a concierge to recommend things to do. They didn't have my requested feather-free room available. The rooftop pool is a huge draw and on the weekends a lot of non-residents go up there. Bellstaff were quick on their feet and security was terrific.Room was on the -17 line - be warned - a little smaller than expected (isn't everything supposed to be bigger in Texas?) and the window was not quite the corner, but flat on the side of the bed. It was ok - helpful to sleep in - but you don't have an easy terrific view, per se. The room was very quiet though, as one side was the elevators. They provided some lovely smelling lavender oil to promote sleep - a great touch. In room safe was big enough for a laptop. Wifi was pretty good. We asked for some foam pillows and it was great to specify firm vs. soft. Plugs by the side of the bed for phone charging. Tea/coffee service in room. Complimentary 1 bottle of water (I think for SPG gold).Bathroom - was decently clean, though there were some hairs that weren't ours found on some towels. Requests for extra amenities (forgot toothpaste) had prompt delivery. We opted for the Green option (get points for eschewing the deep daily clean) for the first night but then wanted the deep clean because we ran out of towels, but they misunderstood and only took out the trash again. We just called for more towels and it wasn't a big deal. We also had to call for more shampoo/conditioner bottles. No body wash - instead it was bar soap, which was ok. My hubby loved the waterfall-type shower and neat drain. No nightlight - it was annoying because the door is frosted glass so if someone goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night and turns the wrong light on, it floods the whole room with a lot of light.Stella San Jac, the restaurant, was pretty good and apparently has a great brunch (though we went for dinner - the biscuits really are delicious).Overall, it was a pretty good hotel stay, especially for a first timer's trip to Austin. I'd recommend it to people who really want to check out 6th Street bars and clubs. We tend to be a little more low-key. We walked most places and they were quite a walk sometimes. I'd say if I were to go again, I wouldn't mind staying there, but I'd probably want to stay somewhere else. The level of service just wasn't quite there, and there were some cleanliness issues. But overall not a bad hotel."
5,I herat country music festival winner.,"The Hotel is beautiful, the staff very helpful and professional. Awesome location. If were ever in Austin again I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. Thank you all for a great weekend. Bonus the restaurant inside the hotel has wonderful hamburgers."
4,Pecan Street Festival,Location was amazing. Rooftop bar and pool was crowded but worth it for the view and the staff were very pleasant along with great drinks. The management immediately corrected an issue we had with being given a 2 queen bed room instead of a king which I requested. The front desk staff was amazing and super helpful. Now the negatives: Room service charged me and didn't show one night after waiting over an hour. The waitress in the lobby bar for breakfast was so slow and at $5/cup of coffee I need at least a refill in my hour it took to eat. The room service I left outside my room stayed on the floor for 2 days so not sure who cleans the rooms and the hallways but they missed it.
5,westin downtown austin,This was a fantastic stay everything was about expectations and a great area to visit. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a comfortable and fun stay. It is located in the heartbeat of the city and easy walking distance to shops and food.
3,great hotel location sadly very hard to rest or enjoy without loud guests and screaming guest in lobby,"sadly very loud guests all weekend...told both the front desk and manager....no action taken....i was told a hotel for people who come to Austin to have fun... told by manager.it is that kind of property....no shoes needed in lobby, men with no shirts...over $400 rate....beautiful work out room on roof unfortunately not monitored so people are allowed to run in there and extend party...vomit smell on chairs in lobby sad because it is a beautiful property with great location...comfortable beds excellent maid service and great restaurant"
2,Great location; Terrible staff,"I recently stayed at the Westin downtown for work, and while the location is great, the staff devalue and ruin the experience. Would not stay again.Pros:Great location near 6th Street & Convention CenterLarge, comfortable roomsCons:Desk Staff-my experience may have been a one off; but the staff was short of terrible. The check in person declined to assist with locating the credit card that should be used for direct billing, resulting in me charging to my own cardRestaurant staff-sat for about 10 minutes before being helped, despite the fact that there were 2 workers standing around talking to each other about their weekend plansCleaning staff-my room was not serviced the second day of my stayValet parking-not notes but expensive valet only parking.($42)"
5,Amazing,"Large rooms. Comfortable beds. Linens and bath towels exceptional. Robes perfect fit.However, the staff is second to none. Super accommodating. Very attentive to ones needs. Could not have asked for a better time.Nice touch? The tv comes with a white noise channel. Along with the blackout curtains, we slept like babies.Well done!"
5,Great stay with pet,No complaints - very friendly staff. I was here with my pug and everyone was more than nice and understanding - even the cleaning staff. Wonderful location as well - right behind 6th street but noise was not a problem
5,Conference weekend,I loved my stay! The entire staff was incredibly helpful. I needed some notecards for my presentation the next day and the staff went out of their way to help me find a solution. Best stay at a westin
5,Suite was awesome,"Very nice Westin. Had 1 of the 4 suites. Had breakfast at the restaurant. It was ok. they say they have fresh juice but they bring it in from somewhere else. Make sure to ask what day they got it to ensure freshness. Good area, close to 6th and SOCO"
5,Excellent hospitality,Food was great and service outstanding and the valet parking was extremely helpful. For business this was the place to stay in Austin by far. I would recommend this to the business traveler looking for value and quality and a great atmosphere.
3,"Overall a good trip, but the last night something happened that changed my opinion","My trip in general was excellent until the last night when I returned to my room. Upon returning, I noticed a note on the counter that was from an unknown person. Being a female, and traveling alone, and not knowing that person I immediately checked everything in the room, nothing was missing, and also checked that I was alone in the room. I then contacted the front desk to ask if someone had delivered a note to my room. They were uncertain, but sent someone to pick it up. Up until that point I had felt safe in my room and in the facility, needless to say that night was sleepless. If the staff had delivered this note to my room, I wish that they hadn't, if this person slipped in when my room was being cleaned this may have not been the fault of anyone on staff as they may not have known or seen the person. I would have given higher marks for service, but the front desk really dropped the ball in this case, and in hindsight I should have insisted on being moved."
5,Loved it!,We were in Austin for a wedding and this was the hotel the happy couple had recommended! Great food and drinks at both Stella and the rooftop bar. Customer service was competent and friendly. Highly recommend
5,Heavily!,"From check-in to check-out my two night stay was heavily! Very friendly staff, greeting you with big smiles, wanting to make everything perfect for your stay. I loved the amenities in the room, especially the lavender oil. One more thing to make sure you have a restful sleep....."
5,Texas hospitaily at the Westin!,I stayed at the Westin for a business meeting in late April. The staff was warm and friendly. Very welcoming. The room was very nice. Very clean. Nicely decorated. Wifi was easy to access and fairly fast. The hotel's recommendation for lunch was fabulous. Breakfast in the res very good. Certainly three steps above hotel breakfast. Try the biscuits!! The roof top pool was stunning and fun. What a view. Great experience. Loving Austin!
5,Fabulous sta,I had the pleasure of staying at Westin Austin Downtown and the experience was very good. The beds were very comfortable and the staff was helpful and friendly. I enjoyed all the dining which was exceptional for a large meeting.
4,Wonderful location for food and music dcene,"Great staff. Wonderful bars,pool,workout. Service a bit spotty. No coffee service refill one day. Room not made up on another day. But the staff was very responsive, concerned and helpful. Too few elevators. Long waits and often sharing the car with linen carts."
4,Lovely,"I want to stay here every time I come to ATX. The people working are lovely, the rooms are modern and clean. You feel like your business is valued. I love the succulents and other greenery in the lobby. I’ve stayed several times while in Austin for work and always enjoy the stay. Great views from the rooftop bar, too."
4,Stay at the downtown Westin,The night club across the street was blaring their bass so loud most everyone in the hotel could hear it until about 1:30am.....which sucked. The toilet handle wasn't working very well...kept sticking so the toilet ran continuously until I jiggled the handle again to stop it. Had a few homeless people I had to deal with on occasion. Otherwise the hotel was decent and the staff was pleasant.
5,Excellent hotel with good service,"Business meeting. Nice and clean facilities; excellent, creative and well-presented food; spacious room; good workout facilities; courteous and friendly staff; and fun rooftop bar with great views of Austin skyline."
5,Awesome and friendly Staff,"Enjoyed my stay very much. Each and every person was truly nice. Anything I asked for, they were quick to do it. Great information on places to visit and things to do. Austin was a great place to visit."
3,Would Have Been Excellent... But...,"Great stay... But.Comfortable room with COOL views.Roof Top Pool and the team are AWESOME.Very good meals and wine at the restaurant Stella San Jac and the team was FABULOUS.But... just called to get a copy of my bill and the first try was treated great, but bill was not itemized.Called back and was treated poorly... just rude and then did not even say good bye... just click.Everything was great, but sadly for me the last interaction ruined it.Give them a try! But I will not... again."
4,Comfortable,Friendly service good location and great food. Enjoyed the stay very much. Stayed there for 5 days and all staff were great. Only drawback was the window overlooked the roofs of other building. Otherwise everything was great
5,Fantastic friendly staff,"The hotel itself is what I would expect from a Westin property, which is to say of a high standard. What made this such an exceptional stay was the quality of the staff. From the moment I arrived everyone from the front desk,the bartenders,wait staff,housekeeping, and doormen could not have been more eager to please. This may have been due to Texas hospitality but I suspect it is an indicator of very high quality management and outstanding employees. Every single aspect of my stay regarding the hotel was perfect. I would recommend wholeheartedly."
4,Nice Hotel; Poor handicapped accessibility,"This hotel is in a great location in Austin. Very nice accommodations, lobby, restaurant, etc. But, the handicapped room was the furthest room from the elevator. For those with severely compromised mobility, the extra long walk to the room was very difficult."
5,Great hotel,"We stayed at the Westin Austin for a night on the tail end of our trip through hill country. The hotel was conveniently located to last bird lake, great food and shopping, and other attractions we wanted to check out (the bats!). The hotel was clean, staff was accommodating, gym was awesome!"
3,ADA Room is a JOKE,"The hotel itself is amazing. Location, food, cleanliness, atmosphere all great. Just don't stay here if you have ANY sort of special needs. Zero grab bars in the entirety of the ADA suite. None! They were very accommodating in finding us appropriate accommodations but labeling a room ADA with no grab bars is ridiculous."
5,"Woot, woot! What a fun hotel!","Fantastic customer service and attitudes. Fun bar, great rooftop pool. Excellent location, super comfortable rooms. Need more? We were there for business meetings in the hotel. I eat a lot of hotel conference room spreads. Mostly, they are dreadful. The food here ROCKED. Everyone at our meeting commented on how good it was."
5,Thanks!,Super awesome location in Austin - and lovely (as Westin does such a great job of always) service.I really appreciated being able to stay here for a week while at a convention. Thanks for the great stay!
3,Bathroom door is frosted glass which basically ruins the room.,"I am not sure why the new Westins have gone to frosted glass doors for the bathrooms. It is horrible. If you turn a light on in the bathroom, it lights up the entire room. I am guessing the architect of this design has never stayed in the actual room with a companion. No privacy in the bathroom. I am here now with my wife and infant. And if anyone uses the bathroom while someone else is asleep the whole room is lit up. Also no fan in the bathroom. No lock. And it is a modern sliding door so it doesn't close well. And like all bathrooms in hotels, the toilet is super loud. So if you flush while others are asleep, everyone wakes up. Also just like I read in other reviews, the shower door closes the wrong way. So water splashes up on the seal and leaks into the entire bathroom while showering. I have been platinum with SPG so I am familiar with Westins. Everything else about the hotel is great. The service, the location all great. $42 for valet parking is a little much. But the glass door on the bathroom is a joke. Nobody likes that."
5,Wedding Bliss,"Here for a friends wedding. Clean, comfortable rooms in hotel located in the center of Austin close to bars, restaurants. Car parking all by valet was efficiently run, somewhat costly, but then didn't tip for every pickup/dropoff."
5,Great Amenities and Service!,"We visited Austin for the first time on April '18 and decided to stay downtown at The Westin and it was certainly the right decision. We had a great time staying at this location, we enjoyed the terrace bar after work and had dinner right across the street at a great steak house."
5,"Good Location, Nice Rooms","We were in town for a wedding. The location is excellent and the rooms are clean and updated. The rooftop pool and bar are very cool but usually extremely busy. the hotel is fairly loud, but that is to be expected. Overall a good experience. Staff is excellent."
5,Survey,"The accommodations were great, but I forgot to ask for foam pillows. The location was great, close to many different areas including the work event that I needed to go to. The services was great and the people were very friendly."
4,Very nice - fairly priced spg hotel,I stayed here for the final four weekend. Overall my experience was excellent. They accomated my friend getting in before me and even upgraded our room (note - I am spg gold). The rooftop pool and bar is quite nice for what it is. Good drinks and a bit of scene. Closes relatively early but that is to be expected.Room was large and clean - no issues at all with the bedroom or bathroom. Westin is centrailly located and while there isn't a ton to do at the hotel - you are in a great spot to walk around a number of great parts of Austin.Would go back again.-Gordo Gekko
3,Waiting for an elevator...,"Great property! Great staff! Great location! Spent way too much time waiting for and, once in, trying to select my floor. Would not recommend for a conference when being on time is important. Make it impossible to run back up to your room during a break."
5,"Great location, comfy bed, great service",This was a sister trip and so we did a lot of coming and going. Great service from curb to room and back again. Valet parking is a little on the expensive side but well worth it in my opinion. Stella is a fantastic restaurant with impeccable service. Room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Our room on the 20th floor was right by the rooftop pool/ bar and the workout room. Enjoyed running on the treadmill while watching the sun rise over the city!
4,Austin,"This hospital is very nice and in a great location. My one negative, why I don't rate it 5/5 is the lack of parking. It is in convenient to have only valet as the option to park. I assumed (wrongly) the hotel would have a parking garage or lot where you could keep your car over night. The only option was $45 valet not including tip. The rooms were very nice though and all the staff was great. The rooftop bar with a view was worth choosing this hotel no doubt. It was an amazing view at night that really topped off a great stay!"
5,Fantastic conference expierence,"I spent 5 days at the hotel for a conference. The facility was amazing, the conference food was SO good, and the STAFF was on their A game. My room was perfect, clean, and very well appointed. The hotel restaurant Stella was so good. The rooftop bar and pool was such a LUXURY and an amazing place to spend the afternoon or late night."
4,Weekend trip to Austin,"Staff were very nice at the hotel, room accommodations nice and clean. It is very close to 6th street, but don't drive your car at night as a lot of streets are blocked off. I was on the 17th floor, so I didn't hear a lot of noise but not sure about lower floor rooms."
5,Westin April 2018,I have stayed a the hotel numerous times for business trips. Rooms and service are always great. Rooftop pool for drinks provides an awesome view of the city skyline and is prefect for drinks with clients.
5,Everything I needed and more,"I was here for business so I wanted a place where I could sleep well and get some work done. The Westin had that! The gym is one of the best that I’ve seen in a hotel. I appreciated the cold towels since I wasn’t used to the humidity. The WiFi worked well enough to operate my computer, which is not always common in hotels. The pillows weren’t too fluffy which is something I really appreciate - many hotels the pillows are so fluffy it hurts my neck. I also really like the option where you can forgo cleaning to receive SPG points as I want to help the environment and am pretty neat so I don’t need a daily cleaning. I used the workout wear rental which was nice to do on my last day (so I didn’t have to pack sweaty clothes) but overall I prefer my own workout gear as the gear I rented seemed a bit overused with the elastic running out. It would also be nice to have a microwave onsite (not necessarily in the room) to be able to heat up leftovers. Although I love eating out, I also enjoy some in-room meals occasionally as eating out three times a day can get quite heavy after a week."
5,Really COOL hotel to stay at,"Here's the reason why I'm giving this hotel a 5 star.1. During check-in they upgraded us to a nice king size room with AMAZING view of downtown Austin. Thank you Rachel for the awesome upgrade!2. There is no fee for my dogs to stay here which is totally cool! It's a very dog friendly hotel. All the dogs were well behaved...except ours. I did not smell dog urine at all anywhere in the hotel.3. They gave our puppies 2 treats and dog root beer. I thought that's pretty sweet of them.4. Our room was very comfortable and the king size bed pillows are really soft. I go crazy for soft and comfortable pillows.5. They made our stay wonderful and I love that they were giving out cotton candy on Easter day. This hotel is also right next to 6th street where all the live music and entertainment at.Although, there is a valet fee of $42 per day plus sales tax. I'm not sure why there's sales tax for valet which I thought is really odd. Either way, I definitely plan to come back and stay at this hotel next year."
5,Awesome stay at the westin downtown,I had a great experience at the Westin Austin Downtown. I had SUCH great service and everyone was very friendly. The location was very convenient. I also loved the rooftop pool and bar. The gym was also nice.
4,"Modern hotel, stylish rooms",In a great accessible part of town. Modern and new. Good size rooms. Restaurant generally open but slightly limited menu. Staff great. Azul on the roof says it opens at 2pm with a lighter menu but staff weren’t opening it until 3pm when I was there which was disappointing.
5,Greatest hotel room I’ve ever had,"I want to shout out Sam at the front desk and the SPG gold program. Make sure if you are in any way eligible for SPG gold that you take full advantage. I booked a deluxe king with a city view. With SPGG, I get a free room upgrade so I was really curious what this would be. I dropped off my stuff and went while my room got ready. While waiting I thought, you know what, I want to pay a little to upgrade whatever upgrade I’m getting. Sam writes back almost instantly, “I assure you that will not be necessary”. I get to my room, it’s a corner suite with giant floor to ceiling windows. The nicest hotel room I’ve ever been in. Cannot thank Westin Downtown enough. I had the most amazing stay."
5,Excellent hotel!,"I like all Westin hotels and the Austin Downtown site is no exception. Great customer service, beautiful accommodations, great city views and extremely comfortable beds. The pool on the roof was fun, the fitness room next to the pool with nice equipment and open 24/7. Staying at the Westin made my trip perfect."
5,Perfect location for weekend getaway to Austin,"My wife and I drove in from Houston and had a wonderful weekend in Austin. It was her first time so I wanted to be in a central spot, close to the action ubiquitous to Austin, so we chose the Westin Austin Downtown. I'm a seasoned SPG member and was therefore familiar with the Westin brand. This place was very much Westin, with a slight touch of W on it, which was great. The Stella San Jac bar was lively Saturday night, and the rooftop bar Azul was great and provided awesome southward (and east/west) views of the city. All in all a wonderful experience and the staff was very kind and accommodating."
5,Pool and Bar on the roof,"I'm a big fan of the Westin downtown if for nothing else - the view from the 20th floor. It take a key and an elevator ride to get to this part of the hotel but it's worth it. Spectacular views and a great little bar. Once you are up there you will not believe they can fit so much into that space, a pool, bar and plenty of seating. Watching the sun go down behind the downtown skyline is beautiful and the Westin has done a great job of lighting that space after dark.It's worth the trip!"
5,Vacation,The Westin hotel was lovely. The room was very nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful and my room was cleaned daily. I highly recommend the Westin Austin Downtown.
3,Just okay,The elevators were down and we had to wait 12 minutes one time to go downstairs. The restaurant attached to hotel only had one server and we gave up on getting service. No one seemed to care if we were waited on or not.
5,Great stay at the Westin,"We were at the Westin for company meetings and had the overall best experience of any hotel we have utilized for these meetings. The food and service was outstanding. However, at bit spendy in the Stella restaurant it was all very good."
5,Bar at the top- amazing view,"Didn't stay here, but did go up to the bar/pool at the top of the hotel. The view is amazing. Drinks are pricey and you must request a key card from reception. However, there are fire pits by the seats, towels to cover up with if cool, and an amazing view of downtown Austin."
5,Westin comfort,"A wonderful hotel, responsive and professional staff; my stay was pleasant. The facilities were top notch and the property is clean, welcoming and thorough. Next time I'm in Austin, I'll be staying at the Westin."
5,A welcomed refuge!,"My husband and I found ourselves in Austin without an available room. The Westin had space and all the staff treated us wonderfully from the time we dropped off our car with the valet. The room was clean, comfortable and the WiFi was easy to use."
5,Stylish hotel with a fantastic pool,"Our family of four thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the Westin Austin Downtown. The furnishings were elegant and contemporary, the service was very pleasant and the rooftop pool was simply outstanding."
5,Allergy Free Room,"I have bad allergies and I would like to commend the assistance of Alex in particular for helping me get on the hotel's allergy free floor as the hotel was full for SXSW. On that floor you can get a room without feather pillows, comforters, etc. Also, if requested they won't use fragrances in the room. Ryan was also very helpful. Hotels aren't always so conscientious about these requests but it makes a big difference for someone with allergies or intolerances."
1,Charged my card twice for incidentals and still haven’t released the hold for either charge,Charged my card twice for incidentals and still haven’t released the hold for either charge. The extra charges caused my account to be charged insufficient funds fee and now my account is negative. Little to no explanation except for a card they put under the door saying a bunch of nothing.
5,Stay at the Westin Austin Downtown over SXSW,"Amazing hotel. I stayed here for 2 nights while in town for SXSW. It was the perfect location as it's central to most everything in the downtown area. Great service, clean rooms, and probably the most comfortable beds/pillows of any hotel."
4,Cleanest hotel room ever,"I travel for work 100-150 nights a year and what amazed me in this hotel was it was sparkling clean every night.For a Westin, I don’t know what was up. The sheets were really rough!The views from the rooftop bar are amazingLocation is great!I didn’t have a great experience with the restaurant. Both dishes were not great. One had only three ingredients and two were missing. 😂"
5,"Great hotel, staff and location","Our hotel got changed to the Westin at the last minute and we couldn't have been happier. No issues, very friendly staff, nice decor, clean/modern rooms and a great location. Food/drinks in lobby restaurant were great as well. Not anything bad to say about this place."
5,One of my favorite Westin's!,"I really liked this Westin because of it's location, location, location. It is in the heart of downtown next to plenty of great restaurants, the infamous Voodoo donut, bars, and more food. It is also close to the financial district for visiting companies. Granted downtown Austin isn't enormous, you can walk everywhere from this hotel (as well as others). The rooms were great, clean, and inviting. Hotel is new, modern look and feel. It's pretty much a W Hotel (usually my preference) disguised as a Westin. Service was good. I will say, price wise wasn't the cheapest though so I would check other hotels if you're on a budget."
1,Was Incorrectly Charged Almost $300,"Not only did my room somehow overlook part of the hotel's dirty roof, but I was incorrectly charged $300. I spoke at a conference, and I was ensured at both check-in AND check-out that my stay would be charged to the conference's card on file.I have spent most of the day on the phone trying to get a refund, and they are saying it may be up to a week, but no one is giving me straight answers."
5,The Best Service,"We had our business conference at this hotel. Service throughout the entire hotel from our banquet team, the bar, housekeeping, front desk was nothing but accommodating and professional! Suites were clean, comfortable and modern! I would stay here again for business or pleasure!"
5,Fantastic time at the Westin!,We recently had a business conference at the Westin Downtown Austin and everything was fantastic. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the service was excellent. The food was wonderful and the day ran smoothly thanks to the amazing staff.
5,"Great place, awesome service.","The hotel was wonderful from start to departure. Great amenities. Superb service and staff. Cozy lounges and bar. I’d stay again when’s the area. Food & beverage staff went above and beyond. Thanks, Monica!"
5,Right in the heart of Austin but quiet.,"Good atmosphere in the bar along with good live music as one would expect in downtown Austin. Friendly staff and great service. Rooms were quiet, even though the hotel is right next to 6th street. Would definitely go back again!"
5,Excellent hotel in Austin,"The Westin Austin Downtown it’s an excellent choice, the location is great close to everything, the staff is very good ( special thanks to Yisenia ). The room is spacious and clean. The rooftop it’s super cool with the pool and a bar in the 20 floor with nice view."
4,Very Nice,"The room was fine, the view - not so much. My only complaint was the lobby ad the restaurant were very cold The desk staff had jackets on as did the guests using the lobby WI-FI. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly."
