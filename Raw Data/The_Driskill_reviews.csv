5,Great Experience,"The hotel has a great history complete with the occasional ghost. The hotel was located if a great part of town and there were plenty of things to do with in walking distance. However, what really mad the experience was the people. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their jobs and dedicated to make our stay a great one!!"
5,Impressive first night,"I just arrived at the Driskill this evening, and have had a great stay so far. I was emailed with my room number a few hours before my requested arrival time, and after a long day in class and a fairly painful Uber ride through downtown Austin (traffic was rough), arrived at the hotel. The doorman welcomed me and held the door, lobby was beautiful and spotless. The front desk clerk welcomed me to the hotel with a smile, quickly reminded me of my room number, informed me about breakfast options and directed me to the elevator. Check-in was fast and helpful, and I appreciated that.There was fruit-infused icewater, which was a nice touch.I'm staying in suite 413. The room is attractively and comfortably furnished, and management obviously has put effort into keeping the rooms functional while choosing decor to honor the history of the hotel. As has been the case in every part of the hotel I've seen so far, the room is spotless. Mattress and bedlinens are comfortable, and the thermostat was set to 70 degrees, which I think is about right for most people. I do not hear excessive noise from the hall or other rooms, and feel like I will be able to relax tonight and maybe get some postcards sent home and do a bit of work.I went down to the hotel bar for dinner. I got off the elevator at Mezzanine level, which takes you into the back of the bar...I was not sure if there was a hostess for seating or it was self-seating, so I asked the first server I saw. As has been the case throughout my stay here, I was welcomed with a warm smile and invited to seat myself. The server who welcomed me was Sara, and I sat in her section of the bar. She promptly brought a menu and took my drink/appetizer order. I had the crispy Brussels sprouts. They were delicious. I was only able to drink one bottled water at lunch today, and guzzled water like a camel, but Sara kept up and never let my glass get more than half-empty despite it being very busy in the bar. I had the smoked French dip. I asked for A1 or Heinz 57 for my fries, and she informed me that they didn't have those. That was okay (she brought ketchup), and I started my meal. The sandwich and fried were good. Sara returned within a couple of minutes with a bottle of A1. I think this woman went to another of the Driskill's restaurants and found it for me. It was busy in that bar, and she had a lot of tables with multiple thirsty guests, but still took a minute to get this done for me. This is obviously someone who takes pride in doing her job well, and I really appreciated the extra effort. I hope the hotel's management will take note.I worked in restaurants in my early 20's. I traveled for business around 70% of the time during my late 20's and early 30's. I've since changed careers and don't travel nearly that much now, but I still do a fair amount of leisure travel and some for business. I feel like I have an understanding of what excellence in hospitality is, and I feel like the Driskill has provided that. I hope the team here is proud, because you've earned the right to be."
5,Great Experience at my recent stay at the Driskoll.,The bed was comfortable/ sheets amazing. Quiet and very roomy. Clean nice size bathroom. Spacious area for working and liked you could close off the work area from the bedroom. Hotel was very clean and friendly staff.
5,Most Excellent!,Wow - didn't know anything about this place and needed a place to stay one more night. What an incredible surprise. Full of character and history. Great live music in lounge and nice cafe. Rooms impeccable along with the service.
2,Worst hotel ever,"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. They gave me a room 3 feet from the elevator. A room like this should not even exist but if it has to, then it should be given to someone who books at that minute or with some crazy discount; i booked 6 months in advance and paid full price. So, every morning we are dealing with loud people in and out but worse is that the service elevator is also right there with the staff slamming the door every 5 minutes from 6 in the morning and on. If I sound a little cranky writing this it’s due to the lack of sleep I’ve had the last 4 days. The staff is not rude but stand offish. The dinner menu ends at 10pm. I called for room service at 10:02 and they wouldn’t let me order potatoes because if was after 10. Not even a, “let me check with the kitchen”; just an F-u. They charge prices like they are a high end hotel but don’t have the attention to detail. My room was pretty spacious but there was only one trash can. There were 2 desks but one chair. Most reservations have 2 people, so what happens when you order room service; one person has To eat standing over the sink? They don’t t even 3 towels in the room, standard is 4. One roll of toilet paper. When we got the room serviced they didn’t replenish the water. There is one tiny towel bar in the bathroom but plenty of wall space. where are you supposed to hang your towel? I tried to get a late checkout, and you would think they could accommodate this given they stuck me next to the elevator but all they could give me 1130 which is the normal checkout time anyway. When i offered to pay they told me it was $100 and could not guarantee it. For these prices you are better off going to the Four Seasons where it’s consistent."
3,"Nice, but not impressive.","Nice, but nothing to get too excited about. Rooms are small. Valet were rude on check out. We couldn’t find a seat anywhere to eat or sit in the bar or empty restaurant at 6pm bc everything was reserved and we were sent to another restaurant across the street. I don’t need to return and you wouldn’t be missing out if you didn’t visit either."
4,Very pricey but nice,"We stayed here for two nights while visiting with family. Rooms are expensive, and you won’t receive much space for that price. But you will be staying at a historical hotel with a good location. Concierge was quite helpful, but the service at the lounge was awful. Our family sat in the lounge for 30+ minutes with no waitstaff approaching us. Won’t stay here again, but it is a beautiful property."
3,"Great, with conditions!","Having grown up in Austin but now living overseas, we decided to stay at the Driskill for a special family event (even though we still have family in town with whom we can stay). We thought the nightly rate of $519 (plus taxes and fees) for a queen room was crazy high, but this was a special night so we booked it. We figured there must be something going on in the hotel or in town to cause a high demand for rooms. As it turned out a large wedding party was in the hotel. After we booked we were offered an upgrade to a king room for $50 plus $8.50 taxes and fees, so we accepted it. Upon arrival the valet was welcoming and friendly and took our car away. Both the outside and lobby of the hotel are regal and grand; a real historical gem. The lady at reception checked us in…"
5,Beautiful Hotel Downtown Austin,"Fun bar and restaurant in the hotel right in the heart of downtown Austin. I have been here a number of times, the most recent for the Austin Film Festival and always have a great time. I’ve never stayed here, living in Austin, but it is a popular hotel"
5,BEAUTIFUL HISTORIC RENOVATION,"The Driskill is an A+ hotel centrally located in lively downtown Austin. This historic structure has experienced numerous sensitive renovations over the years since it's opening in 1886. If you're an architecture lover and don't mind a smaller sized room and bathroom, this might be the spot for you. Many of the hallways are appointed with oil paintings featuring Texas themes. Although they are not necessary original art antiques they create a lovely gallery vibe as you stroll from the elevator to your room. The service was exemplary and the hotel was spotless. There is a lovely breakfast and lunch cafe off of the lobby, where you can buy tasty pastries with your coffee and in the evening, you can relax at the mezzanine bar, where there will often be live music Austin style!…"
4,Visited for F1,Really great historic hotel. The architecture and artwork in the hotel bring all sorts of visitors just to see the lobby.Rooms are nicely done in a very historic theme. Bathrooms a little small but not unusual for a historic property.Food is good. Concierge (Chris) was great and very helpful.They do need some work on housekeeping and front desk. Housekeeping acted annoyed any time you asked for something (like can you come back in 10mins to do room service) or they just did not do it. Front desk was nice enough to extend checkout by 1hour to 1200 which is really more standard than 11. However they invalidated the keys at 1100 so you were locked out of room. Another wait at front desk to get luggage and check out.Otherwise again nice hotel but at the price point they set details matter.
5,LOVE THIS HOTEL!!!,"LOVE The Driskill. My home base when in Austin. What a historic hotel should be. Unique, interesting and best location in town.Rooms are really well done and the nods to Austin’s history.Can’t wait to go back."
5,"Fantastic Conference, Book Fair, and Film Festival","From the moment we arrive we were greeted and helped by staff who bent over backwards to make us welcome. We were able to immediately see the Day of the Dead parade outside the hotel, visit the book fair down the street, and the film festival in the hotel, as well as attend a stunningly good CME conference from University Learning Systems. Bravo."
5,Driskill 10/19,"One of my favorite hotels anywhere. Beautiful architecture. Great location. Excellent staff. The walls between rooms seem fairly thick for an old hotel. Comfortable rooms. Not much of a view, but no worse than any other hotel in that area."
4,Driskill Review,"Besides the rooms being slightly uncomfortable and no hot water, hotel was beautiful. Amazing food, bar and great staff. The entire hotel was squeaky clean and I loved the old-time vibe the hotel captured."
5,Never Disappoints,"My husband does a great deal of business in Austin and whenever I am in tow, we usually stay at the Driskill. The Driskill never disappoints! My last visit there we stayed in one of their spacious suites. An elegant and prominent feature about this room was the double glass French doors leading out to a terrace that provided great views of the city. Indoors there was a fireplace, a soaking tub and workspace, a small walk in closet, and a sitting area. These features made for a comfortable and pleasurable stay. There is a small, but efficiently run café that serves both traditional American style eggs options and fun Mexican style breakfast cuisine. Make sure you are hungry, because the portions are quite large. The coffee and fresh baked muffins made on the premises are another…"
5,Top Notch Hotel,Wish I could have stayed longer! This hotel along with the staff and food are exceptional. One of the quietest hotels (especially being downtown) I've ever stayed in. The staff were attentive and extremely accommodating. I was attending a conference. The food served was not your typical hotel food. It was also exceptional. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The room details are above 95% of most hotels. Highly recommend The Driskill.
4,"Stay in a historic and luxury hotel downtown Austin, TX","Excellent location in downtown Austin, TX. Oldest operating hotel in the city, offers a good approach to luxurious place. Good service and nice rooms. Try to avoid staying in the first floor as it gets noisy (even inside the rooms). The bar seems to be a very popular hanging out place for both locals and guests."
5,Try the Driskill Grill,"Weekend getaway with a gf. We enjoyed the history of the hotel as well as the world class service received by the hotel staff. We spent a lot of time exploring the hotel and admiring the artwork. Don’t be surprised if you see a spirit or two. Supposedly haunted hotel. We stayed in the Governor Suite 😉. Try the Driskill Grill for awesome food and drinks, reasonable prices."
2,Need a massive renovation.,"Beyond the beautiful lobby and rich history of the hotel, it needs a complete gut and an entire renovation. The hotel is extremely long in the tooth. It could be an amazing hotel given it's location and history but it need a $100m renovation."
5,Unique and beautiful,Hotel has such a cool history; you really feel like you have stepped back in time. Elegant decor and bar with glass piano is awesome! Beds are very comfortable and coffee room service came up within 5 minutes at 9 am
5,Beautiful building!,"Food is amazing, staff is friendly, the sites within the entire hotel are beautiful. You must try the 1886 cafe, expensive, but so worth the funds. My only annoyance was that the shower water would range a lot between lukewarm and hot while you were in the shower. But, old buildings have weird issues like that."
4,Loved it,"We only stayed one night at The Driskell while passing through town, but it was fantastic. The hotel is beautiful and historic with lovely details throughout. Check-in was easy and the staff at the front desk were friendly and very helpful. We loved the historical pamphlet available as well as the page about the resident ghosts - very interesting! Our room was clean and comfortable. The bar upstairs was very nice as well and we enjoyed having cocktails and taking in the decor. There was a wedding taking place the night we were there, so it was a bit noisy during the reception hours. (somewhat late) The hotel was very convenient and we were able to walk to sight see and eat. We would highly recommend it!"
4,A historic night's rest!,"Did you know this is where Lady Bird and Lyndon Johnson had their first date? This century + year old hotel is still dazzling in the center of downtown Austin. The location can't be beat as you can really get anywhere in the greater Austin area in minutes from here. If you're up for it, we recommend getting a Lime or Bird scooter right outside and really see the city! The rooms have been kept in their natural state... which is both good and bad, hence 4 stars vs. 5. Some rooms are even claimed to be haunted, although... we did not encounter any such ghosts. Be sure to get a picture in their bank vault and bar :)"
1,love the Driskill,"we love staying at The Driskill - not only is the location perfect for walking to restaurants and bars, the staff is top notch - so friendly ! The bar is also a great place to go - the live music was really good - quite enjoyable"
5,Excellent,"Our stay was great the hotel and staff were amazing. We will stay here everytime we’re in Austin. The room was very clean and there was so much to do in the hotel, as well as it was in a perfect location on 6th street so much to do within walking distance"
5,Great location & staff,Everyone was very helpful and friendly. Great location and rooms were period friendly with high ceilings and crown molding. Room service was great even late in the evening. The bar was also a definite plus for FBS games.
5,WOW! They just don't make hotels like this anymore...,"We came to the Driskill for a wedding and WOW, the rooms, staff, service and everything was simply incredible. The elegance and story behind this charming piece of history is outstanding. We stayed in one of the suites with 19 foot ceilings... My husband and I travel quite a bit and both agreed, we'll never see a room like that again! Such a wonderful trip visiting friends. We can't wait to go back!"
5,Great Location,"Architectural beauty. Suite had a tiny bathroom. The room had a moldy, stale smell. TV in bedroom could be enjoyed. The location of the TV in the living room made no sense. Excellent staff, friendly and knowledgeable."
3,Historic in all senses,"Stayed here during Austin City Limits weekend so maybe they should have some slack but didn't love it. Don't have tables set aside for guests in the restaurant, you have to put your name down behind people who just walked in off the street and wait 45 minutes to eat breakfast, rooms are small and the whole place smells a bit funky. They could take a leaf out of the Westin's book and introduce their own room scent spray! On the upside staff are very polite and friendly."
5,Time for relaxation and plush pampering,"Staying at the Driskill always reminds me to pamper myself. The quality of the linens alone elevates the hotel stay above almost any other I have recently experienced. Being in a central location in the music and business scene is a plus, even for a relaxing getaway. The staff delivered quality as expected."
5,My favorite place in Austin,"This place has become my favorite place to stay while in Austin. The staff is great, the food is better than expected, and the bar is a perfect place to unwind after a day of work. The rooms are on the smaller side, but very comfortable. If there is a negative, it's the small and slow elevators."
1,Happy birthday,"You would not expect this horrible experience from a hotel like Driskill especially a Hyatt, I came to enjoy my birthday in Austin from San Antonio and night out at Fonda San Miguel restraunt. My wife book room for my friend and I on hotels. Com but on arrival they would not check me into room because there policy require person who made reservations. We have booked hotels thru out the world on hotel. Com and never been a problem.I finally received room and the hotel check in clerk gave me a ugly handicapped room for $300 a night. Do yourself a favor don't book Driskill go for Fairmont hotel much nicer rooms and professional staff at front desk.I ask for hotel manager and they give you the run around of where he might be hiding. Room floors are dirty windows were dirty . Stay away from Driskill hotel."
5,Familiar Surroundings,"Had a conference in Austin again and stayed with the Best!!Best service,best rooms,and treated like royalty!! I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Austin! Walking distance to some of the best restaurants and local entertainment too!Highly recommend!!"
5,best place to stay in Austin,"This was my second time at the Driskill, and I will stay there again when in Austin.Great bar, music every night, really good food and truffle popcorn! The rooms are large and quiet, the hotel is centrally located and has a great history. If you are going to ACL, there is a shuttle bus in walking distance."
2,Disappointing Experience,"The staff was excellent but the hotel room was a problem. My wife and I arrived at the hotel and were told our room was overbooked and that we would be given a room with two queen beds and a $50 credit. This was disappointing but not a huge deal. We carried on optimistically and made our way to our room. My wife quickly found it was impossible to shut the bathroom door because the door was rubbing so badly against the door jam, also not a big deal but an annoyance to fight with the door and the scraping sounds everytime we user the restroom. This is also not something that should be happening at a 4 star hotel. We then opened our curtains to find that our view was looking directly at the side of the a/c units and of course all the pipes and moisture that goes along with it. We can only wonder what our view would have been like had we gotten the room we actually booked. Anyway, we had gotten a baby sitter which is not easy for us and we're still remaining optimistic. We closed the curtains for good and carried on to dinner at Eddie V's which was awesome! We returned to our hotel room with high spirits and decided to lay in bed and watch a movie. While laying in bed we were interrupted by the very loud flushing sounds of our neighbors toilet. This carried on throughout the night which I can tell you hurt any chance of feeling romantic. To summarize, they have a beautiful lobby and maybe some nice rooms somewhere, but it was definitely not our room."
5,Perfect combination of history and comfort,"This trip was partly decided upon because I could get a room at The Driskill. I had always wanted to stay there, but past overnight stays in Austin I had not been able to. Historic charms, professional staff, top flight food & drink, all things I had heard about the place and my stay confirmed it. I will definitely make a point of continuing to stay at The Driskill on future personal trips"
5,Great venue for a small conference,"The event, food & beverage and AV team were the best I have worked with! There was not one thing that I had asked for that I didn't have within minutes, and the staff consistently checked in with me multiple times throughout the event. Could not have asked for better service!"
5,Amazing weekend in the Heart of Austin,Had a great weekend with my Fiancée before I deploy for 9 months. The Staff was very friendly and they made it a wonderful experience. I highly recommend a stay at this beautiful hotel and I look forward to coming back for a visit when I return home.
5,Located in heart of fun in Austin Texas!,"TheDriskill Hotel is a gorgeous, classy historic hotel with a great breakfast (helloooo pitchers of mimosas!) and tastefully decorated rooms. The bar has friendly bartenders too. The staff and all needs were met. I partook in a massage at the hotel, but they have outside contractor masseuses and unfortunately for 50 min and $140 (no tip) it was not great. But that had nothing to do with the hotel.The hotel right on 6th street where the street closes down and the fun really begins in the evenings - and VooDoo Donuts is just a quick walk down the road too! this hotel is in a great location!a short ride to the Austin City Limits Music Festival too!"
5,Austin wedding break,"First time at a beautiful hotel, excellent amenities and tastefully decorated. We appreciate the age and decoration and would happily revisit again. We found the atmosphere in the car to be enjoyable and with easy access through the various entrances to get out and about in Austin."
4,paying for convenience,"The location is what you are paying for. The basic room is ok, but if it wasn't for the location you would be paying too much. Customer service was good. Everyone was more that accomodating. Very clean. It was our first weekend away for anniversary without the kids. Safety was never a concern. Overall, a good experience. Just dissappointed in the room for the price we spent."
5,BUSINESS TRIP CUSI CONFERENCE,see previous note. i stay from 9/25/19 thru 9/27/19. the hotel was beautful and enjoyed sight seeing at the capital. the lobby and the conference rooms were georgous. there was alot of homeless people asking for money just as soon as you walk out the looby doors
4,"Location and history are good, staff were great, but the room was not nearly as nice as we expected.","Do NOT pay extra for a balcony room. The Balcony is bare bones, boring, dirty, and had a view of a parking structure. Staff were fabulous, food was very good, especially breakfast. Noise was not an issue for us. $45 a day for valet is expensive."
5,Amazing stay,It was a really beautiful place to stay. Very well kept and clean. Loved the decor and art throughout. I enjoyed the stay and must include that the fifth floor is very spooky. If you’re up for that sort of experience in your travels as well I do suggest this hotel.
2,Historic yes but not charging historic price!,"It was neat to stay here and all but I wish we would have stayed elsewhere and just came in to the bar for a beer and looked at the artifacts. The bed was hard and the maintenance was lacking. The location was optimal if your into 6th street night life. However, the negative with the location is only valet parking at $45 a night!"
2,Room Location Issue,I would not stay here at all. The room I had was next to 6th street. The sound of music from 9-3 AM was non-stop. I hardly got any sleep. My company had meetings at the hotel for two days. Most of our customers agreed that they would not stay here
5,Old school ambience,"The bar at the Driskall looks and feels like an old school saloon. Historically, it’s where Lyndon Baines Johnson had his campaign parties. The wood work around the bar and rawhide barstool covers add an elegant cowboy flair. The drink and wine selection was impressive and the bartenders were skilled and attentive. Great location for a date night or enjoying a cocktail or 2 with friends. Live music was a treat."
2,My business three day trip,Overall disappointed. Room maintenance was substandard. Room service was terrible. Online reservations was terrible. Prices quoted was significantly less than reservation confirmations. Repeatedly cancelled and rebooked. Same result. I would never stay at the Driskill again nor would I recommend to others.
5,Great historic location in the heart of downtown,If you want to be very walkable to Austin nightlife but in an upscale classy place with a lot of historical tradition - this is it! Great food; great service; lively atmosphere; rooms are a bit small but very well done with great decor
5,Amazing experience,Our room was amazing and Christine surprised us with a bottle of champagne and an amazing dessert when we returned from dinner as she found out it was our anniversary. We were also upgraded to a beautiful top floor suite. If ever in Austin again we will definitely return to the Driskill.
4,First time in Austin,The hotel has a musty smell to it as soon as you walk in. Our room was on the 11th floor and was very loud. We were woken up numerous times throughout the night. Staff was very nice. The bar is cool but I do not recommend the French Dip sandwich. There are a lot of homeless people outside of the hotel. Everything is pretty close by which was nice.
5,Stayed for a conference but will be back for pleasure.,"Excellent customer service, lovely room and great food. Loved the old feel of the building and that it was walking distance to many restaurants, great location . I'll be back at the Driskill next time I visit Austin."
5,Great historic hotel.,"When visiting Austin don't miss this great historic hotel. Excellent service, bar and location. Excellent restaurants abound in the area within ready walking distance. Decent entertainment in the bar nightly. Rooms are small but very comfortable."
5,Great hotel for weekend getaway!,"Let me preface this with maybe we just caught it on a great night? Though it was a Friday night before a UT Home Football Game - would have thought it would be crazier, but it wasn't. We found the lobby, the bar, the 2nd floor mezzanine (including balcony overlooking 6th street with comfy wicker chairs) to be very inviting, fun, not noisy or overcrowded at all - plenty of places to ""hang out and enjoy the atmosphere with a cocktail."" Our room was quiet as well. My husband is a Hyatt Globalist, so we were upgraded to the 12th floor. We found the room to be very clean and bed very comfy - like all Hyatt properties. (The ""upper"" floors are adjacent to the property - in the ""tower"" they call it - you have to take a second set of elevators - but it's just like the original…"
5,OUTSTANDING STAY,My stay was short but excellent. I would absolutely stay again. The room was so very comfortable and if I had room in my luggage I would have taken one of those awesome pillows. I went for a business meeting and my only complaint was the conference room was freezing but it was still an outstanding hotel.
4,The devil is in the details,"Beautiful architecture and effort put into the minuteau. The shower curtain is embroidered and the drapes stenciled. A few minor issues...the lobby had a faint mildew smell to it. Second, 6th Street noise carries over a bit which wasn't great in prepping for an early morning conference. Had drunken neighbors stumble in at 2 a.m. and their noise carried through the walls fairly clearly."
4,The Driskell. Bueaty ruined by the RiffRaft,"What a beautiful Hotel with so much history. Sadly, it has been ruined by The City of Austin allowing Crack Heads, Drunks and Vagrants to take over the Streets and allies around it. The Pan Handlers are so bad, you can't walk around without constantly get hit on for money or cigarettes. It is un-safe to be out alone. Especially for a female. The Cat Calls and other rude behavior is appalling. I went on a business trip, but I would never- NEVER - take my Wife, Kids or Grand Kids to down town Austin."
5,Sublime,"Outstanding from the moment the valet waved us to park. Beautiful lobby, friendly and welcoming front desk staff. Ryan is quite the singer! Champagne (prosecco) and treats in our room, unbidden, for my birthday. Ridiculously good coffee and baked goods to start the day. We are already planning to return."
5,Driskill Stay,The Driskill was an amazing place to stay! Everything was more than perfect. It was my husbands birthday and I surprised him with staying at the Driskill Hotel. He loved it. The staff had a special treat waiting in our room when we arrived. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast and the service and food could not have been better. Everything about our stay was amazing!!
3,Not like the Pictures,"First things first, change your room upon arrival, the rooms are very small as are the bathrooms as is the closet. The bar is lovely except the bar staff lack personality, there is musical entertainment and the food is very good.The lobby and hallways are far more grand than the rooms, a number of guests that I spoke to had either changed or tried to change their rooms, some were tied in due to the price they had paid but wished they could move to a better hotel. The neighbour hood is run down with lots of drunks, drug addicts and homeless people. Although the hotel has a lot of history, which is interesting, it’s current day standing would not be worthy of a mention. In my humble option it’s worth a visit but not a stay, there are a lot better hotels in the vicinity that you could pick in far better areas than the Driskill."
5,Great Historic Hotel,"If you ever travel to Austin Texas, stay at Hyatt's Driskill in downtown Austin...You will NOT be disappointed! Great location, wonderful staff and very nicely appointed rooms that are QUIET! They also have a wonderful art collection on floors 4 ad 5."
4,Very good historic hotel,"The Driskill is a beautiful hotel with many original architectural features. Located next to the very lively 6th Street and a short walk to the State Capitol, we particularly enjoyed the stunning bar area with the pistol bar lamps and stained glass dome. Our room was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful."
5,Great stay in austin,"historic hotel that integrated all the modern comforts without compromising the vintage aspects. Room was great, staff was great, location can’t be beat. Highly recommend to anyone looking in Austin !!"
5,Great and Historic Hotel,"Simply a great stay and I loved the watching your team. The food at our reception was amazing, staff attention resolved every issue that arose and the atmosphere made this one of the best meeting stays I’ve had in years."
4,Beautiful hotel but sketchy area.,The hotel itself is fantastic. Beautiful historic interior. Staff is top notch. Austin however has a growing homeless issue and is apparent as soon as you step outside. People stumbling around the sidewalk or passed out (even during the day) harassing you as you're walking to various areas. Didn't see a police or security presence. Felt very unsafe.
1,Don't waste your money.,"The room here was no better than something you would find at a Motel 6. Broken bathroom faucets, ugly repairs, and a huge blank white wall. Lumpy beds and useless pillows. Don't be fooled by the grand lobby as I was. I wasted my money staying here."
3,Pretty but Pricey,Be prepared to spend a lot for a room and unless you spend a LOT be prepared to be underwhelmed. Very cool historic building with a beautiful lobby and expensive rooms. Now that we've stayed there once our curiosity is satisfied and we will plan on booking elsewhere on future trips to Austin.
5,An amazing and unique place,"I found this place to be completely magical and mysterious at the same time. Extremely family friendly and simultaneously very classically elegant and somehow very haute couture. Lots of fun to be had in and around the hotel, as well. The food was amazing, the staff was so gracious and kind. A special place for business or family!"
5,Outstanding/magical,"Lee, was able to help make my fathers wedding day an unforgettable experience!!! Best service and outstanding food!!! Only hotel I will stay at in Austin!!! And ask for valet worth every penny. Thank you Driskill!!!"
5,Austin classic,Classy old hotel with nice rooms and comfy beds. You really get a taste of Texas in the western themed bar. Great central hotel to enjoy Austin at its finest while you play like you’re a cattle Barron!
5,romantic time in austin,"we loved the stay in historic Austin! We would return when we visit our family. Good location, friendly staff and great exercise facility. we loved the coffee, the cafe for breakfast and the bar for dinner. Great value!"
5,Love this hotel,"As a yankee living in LA, i love this hotel because it feels like Texas to me. It’s very old school and full of charm. It’s definitely showing its age a bit but there is nowhere I’d rather stay in Austin (but I could make an argument for the four seasons). Nice bar and restaurant as well. Excellent service. Located in the heart of Austin. I’m a big fan of this place."
5,Wonderful Stay,Everything was top of the line plus the decor was perfectly maintained! Really enjoyed the artwork - an extra and unexpected find. Extremely quiet. Pillows were perfect. Everything was clean and worked perfectly.
5,Business trip to Austin,"My trip to the Driskill Hotel was outstanding. There for business just one night, but the hotel lobby and restaurant were truly highlights. Great hotel, the staff was courteous and professional. I will stay there again on my next trip to Austin."
5,Perfect location,"Located in the middle of everything we wanted to do and see. The condition of this old hotel is incredible. It is a definitely must see even if you choose to stay somewhere else. It is spotlessly clean and just has the best feel to it when you enter. The lounge is great, lots of different seating options, couches, and tables/chairs. Our room was well appointed, metal head and footboard, plus a couch. Ceilings were probably 14' high to make the room feel even more spacious. Bathrooms had been remodeled with upgraded fixtures. Bath products smelled wonderful and the bedsheets were the best!"
5,Lovely old hotel,This hotel was historic in feel but the rooms were up to date. My room was nice and spacious. Bar was spacious with lots of seating groupings. Breakfast and lunch menus in Cafe were good. Food was good.
4,interesting history,especially enjoyed all the historical aspects. enjoyed the bar area and the unique architecture of the building. requests for amenities were responded to immediately. 200 words minimum is asking a bit much don't you think.
4,Need to hire more cleaning staff,"For this price (and it's a beautiful hotel with good food) there's no reason you should have to wait until 5 pm to have your room serviced. There's no way to indicate you want the room cleaned early, so if you go out and spend a whole day in 104 degree heat, you get back to an unserviced room that you can't sleep in because the cleaners are about to knock on your door."
5,"What a grand, old hotel","We ate a great breakfast in the cafe in the hotel when we were here 2 yrs ago. We are so glad we have s chance to stay here this trip. It’s a beautiful, classic old hotel. We love our room (#428) vaulted ceiling, large open room, and a balcony (not that We will use that in this heat and humidity today!!) the bathroom is large, with a shower/tub, toilet and sink. Not only a beautiful room, but comfy and roomy. We are looking toward to having a drink, later, in the hotel bar. We walked through it earlier and it is a beautiful old classic bar. We hear they make a really good “old fashioned”, we plan to try it later. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown on 6th street. Location location location!!!"
5,Consistently well done,"Checking in, bar and restaurant were excellent...valet, breakfast, house keeping and concierge, all excellent. By far my preferred upscale hotel in Austin. Every staff level was very professional and well trained."
5,Stay at the Driskill,"The Driskill is a beautiful hotel in a great location. We visit Austin at least once a year, and we'll be back to stay at the Driskill again soon! Book a room with a balcony. There was a bird egg on the ledge!"
3,Homeless,"The homeless situation is out of control. They are everywhere. They block the sidewalk, harassed my daughter, yell at you if you don’t give them money. In the evening/overnight make noise. This unfortunately takes away from the hotel. The lobby and bar area are beautiful. We had a junior suite which had NO direct light. The windows were frosted over because a wall was right there. According to the management this was a Feature of this room type. They were nice enough to move us to the bridal suite which was greatly appreciated. The room could use some TLC which I informed management. The staff were excellent. They too expressed frustration with the homeless situation. It seems the city of Austin is more concerned as the homeless having a police record then tourist/visitors feeling safe. Disappointing."
3,Disappointed,"You can hear noise from multiple floors. Elevators, some type of machinery constantly clanking. It is definitely not a good night rest. No bar service during HH. No parking area, it is valet only and it is expensive."
5,"Wonderful Hotel, Neat Experience!","We hosted 30 employees from around the country and had a wonderful experience. Very attentive staff and Riley the event planner was outstanding. Historic, interesting, personal, and memorable. Thank you Driskill!"
5,Excellent Service,was on a business trip and the facilities were wonderful. Riley and her staff took excellent care of our team and made the meeting a huge success! The rooms were clean and my double queen was quite large in size. The breakfast was excellent and the jazz singer in the bar was top notch!
5,Step back in Time,"A stay at the Driskill hotel is like stepping back in time. The grand entryway complete with columns and a prominent staircase leading to the bar/lounge makes an impression on you as soon as you walk in. Tour the commons area, lounge, mezzanine balconies and ballroom, and let your imagination take you back in time. The rooms are large including the bathroom areas. Ask for a pamphlet which describes the history of the Driskill. Definitely eat breakfast in the bakery - the food is delicious."
4,Great location historic hotel,- Can’t beat the location- Lobby and bar area were beautiful and very “Texan”- homeless sleeping all over the sidewalks around the hotel - and really all over Austin- no sink space to put toiletries- polyester sheets- friendly and responsive service- expensive parking- good and free internet
5,Nice evening at the Driskill.,We wanted to experience something special in Austin and the Driskill did not disappoint. The hotel is beautiful. The bar was cool with a pleasant wait staff and good happy hour prices. HighY recommended.
5,A great value,"The Driskill is a beautiful, historic hotel right in the center of the Austin downtown entertainment district. You feel like you are stepping back in time when you enter the beautiful lobby. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Our room was small but clean, comfortable and quiet. I think the overall value of the Driskill is very high - I think you get more for your money when you stay here."
5,Best getaway,We had such a great time at the Driskell and Austin area; the hotel is beautiful and all the history and charm made staying there so appealing. Most definitely will stay again! The bakery was amazing and the food was great!
4,Great Location!!,"Beautiful historic hotel centrally located in downtown Austin. Near nightlife and many restaurants. Watch out for the homeless laying around everywhere!! Hotel had a great happy hour in the bar. Breakfast was delicious in the cafe, but service was a bit spotty. Don't pay extra for a better room because they are all about the same because it is a very old property"
5,great hotel; great location,"very nice classic old style hotel in the middle of downtown Austin. Comfy beds, friendly staff and a nice happy hour. Only had breakfast at the cafe, and the service was marginal, and you had to beg for a refill on your coffee, but the food was tasty. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Austin."
5,What a Treat!,"The Driskill Hotel took me back to the grander days of hotel hospitality. My room had all the modern amenities one expects in the modern hotel, but had the charm of by-gone days that is sadly missing today. The staff could not have been more gracious, and the food was top rate. Rather than explore nearby alternatives, I ate every meal in the hotel. The steak and blue cheese mini flatbreads are not to be missed, and I especially enjoyed the waffle with fresh fruit, I would not consider any other hotel on my next stay in Austin."
5,Great for business trip,"Room was good, staff were very friendly and helpful. If access to 6th Street venues is important to you this is perfect. Lyft and Uber drivers seem to have a hard time with the address of 604 Brazos so give them exact pickup details if using those services."
1,Hyatt destroyed this historic hotel.,"First, the redesign took away from the historic feel of the once charming hotel. Second, don’t eat the bar food....”horrible” would be a compliment for our dinner.Overall, not worth the cost...stay at one of the nicer hotels, you won’t regret it."
5,Highly Recommended,"Very nice, clean, comfortable, convenient location, and great staff. The décor is lovely and reminds me of a movie set. The beds are very comfortable and the room is very accommodating. The great variety of restaurants in the area and it's very quiet."
4,Nice historic hotel,"Overall a very nice hotel, it's older but has some nice updates. AC was very noisy in the room but could not hear anything from outside the hotel with the added glazing added inside the old windows. Nicely stocked mini bar fridge, the 1 liter bottle of water was a bit steep at $6"
5,beautfiul and classy,a place my family and i enjoyed on a busy weekend. lots of live music- fun and late night food.Try it out and see what you think- love the architecture... comfortable beds- nice linens and breakfastAustin is a must due
5,Family Wedding,"The staff were very helpful, the bedrooms very clean and the wedding event was well received by many of the people present in such a prestigious hotel. All of the family members who flew in from overseas said how well they were received by the hotel and it's staff."
1,"The hotel smells, the place is run down","What a disappointment. The rooms are super run down, the hotel smells, the AC is noisy to a level a normal person can’t sleep with the system on.The reviews we read do not reflect this zero maintenance facility.‘Oh and there was no concierge to boot - it’s Sunday “her day off”.What a let down"
5,Historic Driskill,"We loved this hotel! It's absolutely beautiful and the staff were wonderful. We always love staying in historic hotels that have a story. This was on our bucket list so we'd been trying to find an excuse to get to Austin to stay. A draw was that it's haunted, but, alas, no ghost stories for us this trip. They don't have a pool, but you're allowed to use the pool at the Hyatt Regency (which we did), or they have passes for Barton Springs."
5,Best kept secret in Austin!,"The Driskill will be my top Choice when visiting Austin! Great location, huge balcony overlooking the city, fabulous food, nice amenities, walking distance to the river, food, entertainment and shopping. Gorgeous stateroom!"
5,A magnificent hotel,"The building is impressive and the staff were extremely accommodating. We were there for 10 days for our son’s wedding. Hotel staff accommodated our large groups in the bar and grill and the 1886 cafe.We needed to have my son’s tuxedo shirt pressed, some of our guests needed last minutetransportation to the church, a boat cruise to see the bats was arranged by the concierge. We even needed a ballroom to rehearse the mother-son dance. Everyone took care of every detail."
5,First time - won’t be my last!,"From the time I arrived with the valet service to the time I left, it was an extremely enjoyable and memorable experience! The rooms were clean and quiet. I especially enjoyed the historical photos and displays throughout the hotel."
2,Not a true Hyatt,$45 overnight forced parking and be prepared to wait a minimum of 20+ minutes for your car to be retrievedWarm water at best in bathroom but customer service at desk and location were great. Just expected more
5,Beauty inside and out,"This is a must see hotel while visiting. It was restored in 1970. So much grandeur to take in from the entry to the grand staircase, marble floors and a multitude of columns. There is a beautiful bar upstairs as well."
5,Excellent place to stay!!,"OMG, one of the best hotels to stay. Not only has excellent customer service, but one of the best stories. I was able to visit the Crystal Hall and the Hall of Mirrors. The experience was phenomenal as through these rooms you can transport yourself to the past! I recommend it 100%."
5,Great hotel for Conference or a weekend away,Loved this hotel. Very historic and great charm. Location was perfect for our conference and business meetings. Rooms were modern but cozy. Would definitely visit again for pleasure with family. Great staff as well.
5,A MUST SEE HOTEL,This hotel was incredible! If you are visiting Austin you should look no further when choosing a hotel. Their customer service we above expectation and bartenders were so friendly. There is an attention to detail here that you will not find anywhere else.
5,Historic spot in the heart or Texas,"We attended a wedding which took place in this beautiful hotel. Our accommodations, the wedding, the location, the staff, the food, the bar, the music - everything was perfect! I love historic hotels and this is a beautiful one located in the heart of Austin, Texas. Colonel Driskill knew what he was doing when he had this hotel built back in 1886. This is Texas at its finest!"
5,Summer Wedding at the Driskill!,"You will not find a more charming experience in Austin than at the Driskill! The hotel staff is world class, the food is always delicious, the rooms are charming and comfortable, and the venue has some of the most beautiful and historic views around!"
5,The Driskell is always a hit!,"While my latest stay was for work, I’d stayed just a couple weeks before for pleasure. This place is wonderfully “Austin”, it’s texas enough, it’s classy enough and it’s got some age on it! There is a Gold’s gym across the street, a P. Terry’s burgers a few steps from that and EVERYTHING in downtown austin is a short walk away."
5,Gem in the Center of Austin,"I return to the Driskill each time i visit Austin because it feels like home. While the character of the city has changed over the years (and is still inexorably changing) the Driskill is an oasis of calm and genteel living amidst the hubbub of scooters, hipsters, hipsters riding scooters, and other fol-de-rol that accompanies the local populace's efforts to ""Keep Austin Weird"".I shall inevitably return, just as Austin shall inexorably change...."
5,Pleasant stay,"I stayed three nights in this hotel. Parking is a bit expensive - $45 per night. Otherwise, it is an excellent hotel in the heart of Austin. Pleasant staff. Quiet,clean, comfortable room. Nice gym and great steam room.."
4,Best in town,"while visiting my friends from College I stayed at the Driskill and love it. The staff were pleasant and the rooms were very clean. Best of all is the location, easy to get everywhere without having to go too far. I would recommend stating here, very nice place"
5,Loved it,Really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is beautiful and full of history. It is centrally located. The staff is courteous and friendly. The restaurants and bar are good. Live music at the bar Thoroughly enjoyed our visit
5,Amazing night at the Driskell!,This hotel is stunning with the beautiful architecture! Sydney made sure my surprise to my husband was a special one. The location is perfect and next to 6th Street! Perfect for site seeing! The food is also amazing! This is a perfect hotel for your stay in Austin!
5,Great base to see Austin,We had an excellent 4 night stay. The hotel is full of character and has a great buzz about it. The staff are extremely helpful while the bar is of particular note with a great range of excellent cocktails. Would definitely stay again when in Austin.
5,First Austin visit,"Great hotel, very nice amenities with spectacular classic furnishings. The staff is second to none and the location is perfect if you are exploring 6th street. If you want to experience a great hotel that has class and elegance, the Driskill is a must."
5,awesome hotel and service,"They pay attention to the small things, both with the service and the hotel itself. The hotel room price is a great value. Room was nice and cool when we checked in, music was playing, and they bought the luggage up to the room for us."
5,Great Stay,"Stayed here for 6 nights; friendly staff upon request provided me a room on the quite floor (on the tower side). Great concierge who always answered questions, gave cold water bottle as we were stepping out of the building, and even gave a teddy to my 14 month old. That tells you that they have empathy/appreciation towards their customers. The quality of the service is top notch."
4,Gorgeous Hotel,"Overall the Driskill was a beautiful hotel with a lot of heritage and appeal. The room was fairly comfortable, but the bathroom was far too small to have an inward turning door. There is no parking nearby so expect to valet. Valet was prompt and courteous, but be cautious of overcharges for the service. The biggest issue is the smell. It is a very old building so some smell is expected. We knew going in from friend's recommendation that the smell was a thing but was shocked as to how strong it was. Upon asking I found that the public areas of the hotel have an artificial ""old building smell"" (musk + dust + decay) piped into it. This was extremely strong and gave my wife an almost instant headache. The smell was less powerful in the room but still very noticeable. Once the room had cooled and the A/C shut off the smell seemed to reduce further for me but my wife reported that it never subsided for her. If you don't mind strong smells it adds to the allure of staying in a hotel that is over 100 years old, but if you are sensitive to smells you might consider something more modern."
5,Living History,"An historic hotel and THE place to stay in Austin. Wonderful hotel evocative of an earlier time, but providing a thoroughly modern experience. Great room with all amenities. History permeates throughout this beautifully decorated hotel. Staying here is a unique experience. While the hotel is wonderful, it is the staff that provide a genuine welcome and the highest level of customer service. Everyone made us feel at home. This is a special place."
5,Driskill for Business Travel,"Had a great 3 night stay at the Driskill for work related purposes. It's a grand hotel, large rooms, quiet. And the food in the downstairs restaurant is excellent. Stay there if you can. It's close to everything - lively downtown 6th street and Rainey (where all of the bars and great restaurants are located). Also used Bird to travel."
4,Neat hotel!,We were extremely pleased with the room and furnishings at the Driskill and especially the location to 6th Street. Their pricing was so much more reasonable than several of the other hotels in the same area.
5,"Best Hotel in Austin, TX","Amazing in every aspect. Clean, A/C, beautiful and modern in a historic setting. Very charming and staff was wonderful. The location is perfect in downtown Austin with access to everything closeby per walking or Uber"
5,perfect,"perfect stay.perfect hotel.perfect service.perfect location.perfect room.perfect ambience.perfect scene.perfect haunted.perfect staff.perfect atmosphere.perfectlocale,but quiet expensive though."
5,Outstanding Service and Beautiful Hotel,The highlight and finishing touch to our family vacation. Will be back soon! Amazing staff and big thanks to Joaquin and Jeffery at the front desk and another big thank you to Jay at the door for everything!
4,Weekend in Austin,The Hotel is Beautifully decorated. Staff were nice and helpful.My favorite part was the large soaking tub and the shower room.The food in the restaraunt was very good. The stained glass in the lobby was beautiful.The bed was very confortable also.
5,Individual attention,"It's difficult to describe our amazing stay at the driskill. The location, perfect! Right on 6th street, close to popular nightlife and great restaurant, without leaving the hotel! The hotel has beautiful history that is well preserved and displayed! I loved our stay and highly recommend. It's a high dollar hotel with equally great service that is personalized for the guests."
4,A fun staycation.,"I surprised my wife by booking the governors suite for July 4th and we were both very impressed. The oversized balcony overlooking 6th street was ridiculously cool! The hotel lobby is beautiful end the artwork on display throughout the facility was top notch. We love our hometown and had a really good time indulging in a special night out. The only thing that kept me from giving the Driskill 5 stars was a somewhat disappointing but expensive dinner in the hotel restaurant. This was probably just an unusual occurrence based on how wonderful everything else was during our stay. I will add that my wife was satisfied with everything she ordered and I do plan on trying the restaurant again. One experience is certainly not enough to pass judgment. Overall, I highly recommend the Driskill for those looking for a beautiful, historic downtown Austin experience."
5,Amazing and unique property,I stayed here the week of July 4th and was not in the least disappointed. The entire property is unique and beautiful. The rooms were very clean with plenty of room and house staff was exceptional. The location is perfect- in the middle of everything yet quiet retreat when you need a break. There is a Royal Blue Grocery on the same block and Congress Bridge (bats!) is just a short walk and from there you can catch the trail around the lake. The bar is beautiful and different. Did not have any ghost encounters! I would definitely stay here again.
5,Excellent Service!,"Our room was very clean, front staff very professional and pleasant. Hotel restaurant breakfast delicious! Best banana bread! Coffee the best! I loved the vintage decor. Next time I'm in Austin I would love to stay here again."
5,A Charming Anniversary Stay,"We were pampered from the moment we arrived at the Driskill. Very special (albeit small) room and great food at reasonable prices. Superb location for the nightlife on 6th street, as well walking distance to the Capitol and several other tourism spots. We felt that staying at the Driskill was a step-back in time into the history of Texas, and a ""destination"" stop for our touring of Austin."
3,Downtown Austin.,"Too many homeless. Hotel was great, but was surrounded by hordes of homeless. They were sleeping in the sidewalk, harassing visitors, and trashing up the entire area. Unless Austin and the Driskill get a handle on the homeless problem, would not recommend anywhere in downtown Austin."
5,A timeless classic,I stayed here for a week with my daughter. I can not recommend it highly enough. The food is excellent and the reception staff are simply amazing. If you need a great hotel in Austin then look no further.
5,A great weekend at the Driskill,"My wife and I have a tradition of spending a weekend at the Driskill to celebrate our anniversary, and this year was a phenomenal success! The hotel is in a perfect location to hit any of the great restaurants in downtown Austin, and the on-site Sunday brunch was scrumptious. The staff even went so far as to provide champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries to help make our anniversary special. Thanks to everyone at the Driskill for helping us have a great weekend!"
4,Really cool historic hotel.,We stayed at The Driskill for two nights in February. The location was great for nightlife and we were close to the Capitol building. Carriages were parked in front of the hotel each night offering different tours around the city. We had breakfast in the restaurant each day and were very impressed. The meals were excellent and a good value.
1,Musty Odors,"The Driskill has a wow factor upon entry to the large lobby with large glass chandelier, then that's about it. The front desk was helpful in accommodating us as we had originally booked the junior suite and found it smelled musty, had pillars throughout the center of the living room and had no windows facing the outside as it is in the center of the hotel. They gave us a downgrade to the Deluxe Suite, which we were thrilled with as it was much nicer, more welcoming and smelled less than the junior suite. This is not to say, however, that we were happy. The hotel is not cheap and we were overwhelmingly dissatisfied. Our switched room décor was a bit more modern and light in color but, still had an air of old and a smell. The room itself was very large and bathroom had old tile work and fixtures, the shower had a curtain, ewe! The tiles and fixtures weren't new styles that mimicked old it was just old. Part of the issue of this hotel is that it is historic and it is apparently limited on what can be updated. I am a fan of historic, old buildings, but this one with the smell just didn't do it for me. The fitness center was good and the attached 1886 Café & Bakery was good. The Driskill Bar had a fun old cowboy look, but stunk of old ""uncleaned"" booze. The location is good, but not a reason to book. After wandering past/through other hotels I would have preferred to stay at The Line or Kimpton Van Zandt which had equally good locations. Super disappointed."
4,Very Old and Very Cool - Pluses Far Outweigh Minuses,"One of the most iconic hotels in Texas, with a great location right on Sixth Street (right at the beginning of ""Dirty Sixth""). The rooms are small and the bathrooms tiny, but the beds are great, the AC cranks loudly but strongly, and the bathroom vanity is more than large enough for a well-stocked couple. Love the bar, one of the great bars in Texas, live music most nights, just classy and comfortable. Also love the huge veranda/balconies on the Sixth Street and Brazos sides - great for that late-night cigar you suddenly just have to have. Fair rates in the mid-200's, but $40 to hold your car (ouch!!). The breakfast/brunch place is excellent, always have to catch at least one meal there.You know, if it's really all about location location location, this can't be beat. You're only 10 feet from the throngs on Sixth Street each night, but inside it's quiet and cozy - you'd never know it.One last thing: If you're thinking of staying here or anywhere else downtown, be aware that the homeless situation is completely out of control. I'm a big guy and I was accosted every block or two, and if you're a woman you may be a little scared to walk around at all. One guy in a wheelchair lunged at my wife and barked at the top of his lungs when she tried to walk past him, scared the crap out of her. On the way home she said, ""Maybe next time we stay somewhere out in the country""."
5,Reunion,The hotel was the first hotel I checked into flying in from Chicago. It was a perfect location on a Saturday night. We smoothly checked in. We walked outside onto Sixth Street. We enjoyed our evening.
5,Delightful Stay - With One Exception,"We checked into this beautifully restored and well-maintained old hotel in Austin, TX for a night's stay on our 30th anniversary. Neither of us had had ever stayed there before, but I had the opportunity to stop into the lobby about 12 years ago while on a business trip. The hotel has been though a few owners over the years, most recently being acquired by the Hyatt Chain which has the financial resources to keep in in such fine condition.We had booked on-line and then contacted them directly to see if any special perks were available for an anniversary celebration – there were. A bottle of Prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries were brought up soon after we checked in. The room included a large sitting area – actually a separate room from the bedroom – in which could be found a flat screen, writing desk, a sizable sofa, coffee table and coffee maker. The bedroom – as you might guess – held a king-size bed, an armoire that hid a fully stocked mini -bar refrigerator, and room for anything you did not want left out in the room. A safe could be found in the small closet along with a luggage stand, ironing board and iron. A full-length mirror was discreetly mounted on the inside of the closet door. The bathroom was tiny. There is no other way to describe it with the close proximity of the toilet to the tub and the sink no more than a few inches. The door to which was narrow, and the shower/tub lacked hand hold bars making it not ADA complaint. My guess is though that the hotel does have rooms that are retrofitted to accommodate people with disabilities – just not our room.Both rooms had their own thermostat controls to a very efficient well working HVAC system. Comfort in the summer heat of Austin was easily achieved in these rooms that had at least a 10-foot ceiling, maybe more.Like all chains today, there was a large selection of local television programming available and expensive movies to rent ($19.99). We found PBS without much trouble.We took our dinner in The Grill Restaurant just off the bar lobby and both chose the same entrée – a rare occasion for us – the Basque Chicken which we both found quite tasty. Desserts were offered at a reasonable price, and coffee at hotel prices ($3.50). All -in -all, a wonderful evening was had. That is until we returned to our room just in time to see another hotel guest cast a dirty diaper into the hallway. This – as you might guess prompted an immediate call to the guest services. There were apologetic and promised to “send security right up to investigate.” Well, the following morning the diaper was not only still there, but it had a companion. So, I took photos and promptly elevatored down to show them myself. They were aghast and shocked, and the on-duty manger promised to go directly up and remedy the situation. When I checked out they compensated me with a significant amount off my room charge. It was a nice touch which I accepted. It seems the hotel did not want to interrupt the offending guest’s stay by knocking at their door to inquired why they were chucking dirty diapers into the hallway. Go Figure. Austin does live up to its adopted slogan of “Keep Austin Weird.” Fecal matter in the hallway, does seem to phase them.If you go, there are a couple of things you might consider before booking. First, there is no parking. You have to pay a parking charge – or select a room rate the includes valet parking in a nearby lot. Second, the hotel does not have a pool, but in all fairness they offer a free pass to an outdoor place called Barton Springs municipal pool – no mention of how you get there once your car has been sequestered by the valet, or what you will encounter for parking once you arrive there. Third, you don’t really want to drive in Austin anyway, with the scooters, bicycles and indifferent pedestrians, it is a zoo. Finally, our bill included a City Occupancy Tax of 9%, State Occupancy Tax of 6%, a State Cost Recovery Fee totaling $2.36, and a State Cost Recovery Fee Occupancy of $3.44. All totaled, $52.53 for services that I paid for, but did not receive. Keep Austin Weird."
5,Wonderful,"I've stayed here before and will continue to stay here when I'm in Austin. Still waiting to see the Ghost of the Texas Ladies' Man who is said to haunt the place. I enjoy the bar and hanging out in the lobby before venturing out into the night for some dinner and music.Great accommodations, Texas deluxe."
5,Great Experience,Very good experience with great services. Food was fantastic.Staff was exceptional. Restoration impressive. Two hundred characters for a review is expecting wat too much and has altered my impression of the organization.
5,Excellent stay at the Driskill,"The Driskill hotel is like a step back into an elegant time. The hotel retains the opulence and details of 1886 when it was built. We stayed in a smaller petite room which was beautiful with high ceilings and period woodwork. Bed was comfy with nice pillows. The bathroom was a bit cramped but we didnt mind as it was part of the experience of staying here. The hotel bar had live music and a nice relaxed atmoshpere with plenty of places to sit and relax with a drink. Breakfast in the 1886 cafe and bakery is not to be missed. While I was initially hesitant about the valet parking, it was very efficient. When you want your car you just text your ticket number and your car will be out front in less than 15 minutes. The hotel location is perfect for checking out the capitol building and grounds, the action on 6th street and walking up and down Congess Avenue. We will be staying at the Driskill again when in Austin. One caveat is that 6th street is blocked off on Friday and Saturday nights so if you drive back to the hotel late, be sure to come from the congress street direction down east 5th to Brazos."
5,Great location.,"We have never been to Austin before and the Driskill was in the perfect location for us. Very close to the river, 6th, So. Congress and Rainey St. lots of places near by for great meals. Live music in the bar. Quiet room at night👍🏻"
5,Grandsons wedding,Loved the online check-in. Staff friendly and helpful. Room clean and housekeeping staff friendly. Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. Loved our visit and will return soon. We had at least 40 family and friends staying at the hotel and no one had anything negative to say.
2,One night at the Driskill,"So we stayed here on a weekend trip from San Antonio because we wanted to go to Franklin BBQ. My fiance picked this hotel because of the decor she likes the colonial style. The inside has an old fashioned colonial feel and is open and looks nice. The lady at the front desk was very short and to the point not very nice or friendly. To get to our room we had to take two separate elevators in two different parts of the building. It was like walking through a maze trying to get in and out from our room. The rooms themselves were clean but very small, especially the bathroom. The beds are very stiff and hard so unless you like sleeping on a SUPER firm mattress this is not the place to try and sleep. The pillows were just as bad one of them was so thin and soft it like split the filling when you laid your head on it and it was equivalent to just laying your head on the mattress. The other pillow was just as firm or firmer than the mattress itself. Only reason why I would recommend you to stay here is if you want to party it is right on 6th street but there are much better options for the same price just a block or two away."
5,Charming History in the heart of Austin,"History in the heart of Austin. Very centrally located. Beautiful rooms. Modern amenities. Great history, you can stay anytime at a chain hotel this is special. Great staff. We had a conference there and we’re very well taken care of. I will definitely recommend you stay at this one of a kind charming hotel with lots of history and modern amenities."
5,Best place to stay in Austin,2 nd time staying at the Driskill and I still amazed at the place. Great decor great staff great rooms. All kinds of history and very cool unique place. Civil war era but up to date amenities for the modern traveller. Love this place
5,Amazing Stay!,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights for a personal vacation. Great historic hotel, great location and great food! The concierge (Chris) was so informative and made our stay so much fun. The access to Barton Springs Pool was definitely a ""cool"" experience, too."
5,Great stay!,Road trip with my daughter for an overnight stay on the way to San Antonio. Great service and interesting history of the hotel. Beautiful place to stay and great live music in the bar and grill. I would definitely stay here again!
3,For an average person it was sort of average.,"Be prepared to pay for parking, and high Austin taxes. I am an average guy so spending lots of money on drinks and dinner is not my thing. The location on 6th street was the thing that sold me. My wife and I wanted to be right there at that spot. So for that it was perfect. I guess my rating of average means that the room was clean and comfortable, there was a tv, a coffee maker, clean towels, and good service. Thats what 300 bucks a night gets you in Austin! Seems like you should get more for that much, breakfast not included. They wanted to charge an additional forty bucks for breakfast! If your an average guy, 40 bucks for breakfast seems outrageoulsy high! How awsome could an egg possibly be?"
5,Stay in Style - Like a Texas Cattle Baron,"Truly impressive, the Driskill is like a trip back to the days of grand old hotels and cattle barons. The lobby is breathtaking and looks like something from a movie set. The rooms, though not huge, are beautiful, very comfortable and well appointed. The bar is gorgeous. The service was impeccable throughout our stay.Austin has definitely moved on from those days, and not entirely in a good way. Within a block of the hotel there are panhandlers and some seedy looking bars. Although on second thoughts, maybe that was the case back in those good ol' days of Cowboys and Saloon Girls!"
5,The Driskill...the best place to stay in Austin,"The Driskill's history and ambiance is amazing and the hotel itself, the incredible service provided by all the staff, and the food and drinks are excellent. This is the only place I stay when in Austin."
5,excellent,Wonderful hotel. The hotel was clean and comfortable. it was very quiet at night. The bar was fun and lively. I would stay here again. It was also within walking distance of many restaurants which made it very convenient. The convention center was a few short blocks away.
2,Don’t bother ...,"Don’t bother until front desk improves! The service in other areas of the hotel were great, the valet was good, the food and bar area were good, our rooms were very clean and the Location is great! The hotel is charming but the overall service at the front desk.....not so good! Come on Hyatt you can do better! Disappointed!!!"
4,This place is haunted!,"1) Put the baby to sleep with the nanny in the room before we left at 10:00PM to go out for drinks. When we left baby and nanny were asleep with the lights off. When we returned at 1:30AM two recess lights were on and nanny said she was asleep the whole time.2) Wife and I hung out in the lobby looking at the Grand Staircase at about 1:15AM. She sees a young girl dressed in white shorts and purple shirt walking down from the top. I saw no one but heard a kid whispering.3) The nanny, who is a also a Brasilian nun, became violently sick and almost past out the next morning."
5,Awesome Hotel,"The Driskill is an iconic building in the heart of Austin, you can help to notice it, a reminder of an era long gone. We had visited the driskill many times when in Austin and always wanted to stay there. The experience was absolutley everything who tough it was going to be from the minute we check in to time we left.Everyone was polite and friendly, a big shout out to Joaquin who did not hesitate to tell us all he knew about the history of the Hotel.The 1886 Bakery cafe had a great selection of food, we decided to have breakfast and it was so delicious, we ordered the hang over omelette and the Texas waffle, definitely money well spend and reasonably priced. The location of the hotel is phenomenal since you just walk out and there you are in the middle of the 6 Street action, lots of bars and live bands playing.Richard at the front desk make check in very pleasant, our waiter Jesse was very attentive and Maddie the Host at the Cafe had a great attitude, overall we will come back to The Driskill, it is an 1886 building that has been renovated many times and has all the amenities of any modern hotel."
5,Driskill,"Was visiting Austin for a convention. This was my first time to stay at the Driskill and hopefully not my last. Room and service was excellent. Beds are very comfortable and service in the bar area was excellent. Try the chocolate cake, you won't be disappointed."
5,The Driskill hotel,"Driskill hotel, a bit pricey, make sure you know the fees involved, my original bill was $210, final invoice over $300 with $40 parking, $6.50 water (I was told were free to a discoverist), but other than that, I love Hyatt, and it was interesting."
2,Grizabella from Cats?,"Run down mess. Iconic hotel in need of renovation and upgrade in staff morale. Not at all friendly and guest oriented. Great location and history, but disappointing. Damaged furniture in room. Damaged, dilapidated elevators to name but a few of it's shortcomings. I am happy to pay $300 or more per night, but this place was not a good value for my money."
5,A Grand Hotel in a very cool spot,Love this hotel right in the center of the 6th Street music scene. The double paned windows kept the ruckus outside on the street where it belonged. Fitness room was a real bonus and the bakery was filled with attentive waitstaff and delish choices!
3,Beautiful Common Areas; Food and Service Need Upgrading at These Prices,"The lobby, grill, bar and common areas (excluding ballroom and conference areas) are vintage grand hotel. Lovely and welcoming. The bar waitstaff were also efficient and pleasant. The bar sandwiches and salads were a huge disappointment for a hotel of this pretension.What really turned us off was Sidney at the Front Desk who checked us in. She was not so welcoming, and her answers to each of our questions was phrased with an supercilious edge - not good. She also failed to give helpful information on area self-park lots, as well as failing to give accurate information on the valet service at The Driskill (which costs $48). We have traveled all over the world, and stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels, and rarely see a case of attitude at the Front Desk.Our tower room 603 was fine; charming, fitted with two luggage racks, small for two Queen beds, very traditionally furnished. Corridors outside were very narrow, and loud at night.Be aware the this area is full of homeless people, which is a huge problem in the heart of downtown Austin. We were repeatedly accosted on the street, and cursed. Having lived in major cities such as Chicago, Boston, NYC, we are familiar with the problems, but it did not appear that Austin was doing anything to manage or help those involved."
5,Yellow Rose Suite,"I booked the Yellow Rose Suite for my girlfriend for her birthday, and the both of us were incredibly surprised. The price of room service was of course quite high, but overall the room service, response time, and experience was great. The tub has a built in Jacuzzi, there were two very comfortable robes for us to wear and incredibly comfortable furniture. My only complaint was that I booked the Bed and Breakfast, and it only covered $56.00 of the breakfast bill and our bill came to $68.00. So the Bed and Breakfast has a limit."
2,Historical building,"I spent 4 nights here. Building is beautiful and characteristic, but service is not impressive at all. Staff at the front desk need more training in hospitality. The first thing in hospitality business is a simple smile and warm welcoming which they lack both!"
5,Thank you,"Beautiful architecture, and location. If you arent stating here, you should definitely visit. have some breakfast or dinner. I came here for work/leisure with my sister. I book corporate travel so I was fortunate to stay here and get a taste of Austin. Happy to say it was a lot more fun than I anticipated. This hotel is located off of 6th st so theres is plenty to do within walking distance."
4,Honeymoon start,"We were quickly greeted by a welcoming valet who loaded our numerous wedding bags up. Checking in was quick and easy. Our room had chocolate covered strawberries and champagne to celebrate our wedding night, which we loved. The room was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Nice sheets and great AC. The amenities were what drew us (room service) as well as the history (Lady Bird and LBJ had their first date here). We had a great breakfast in bed- strong coffee, eggs Benedict and a Texas shaped waffle. The room we stayed in overlooked 6th Street, which was (to be expected) noisy on Saturday night. Our hallway was quiet and we slept great. The staff were all friendly, quick to help, and efficient. The only negative was when we ate brunch Monday morning at the 1886 Cafe. We felt ignored and rushed. The service was poor and the atmosphere doesn't match the elegant and sophisticated feel of the hotel. That said, the food was good."
3,Loved the history,"Hotel is beautiful and has a lot of history. I enjoyed reading and knowing how The Driskill bought by Jesse Driskill ended up with Hyatt. The paintings, to vault, room decor, hotel decor takes you back to the 1800's. Impressive!The room was nice and clean. I enjoyed the soft pillows. Bed was comfy. Nice historic hotel.Ate at the Bar - The food was ok. Ate at the 1886 Cafe & Bakery - Food was good but there were food flies flying everywhere. Over the food and my daughters head. That ruined the meal as it's such a historic landmark in Austin and an upscale hotel with a pricey menu to experience eating with flies all around you. Due to the 1886 Cafe & Bakery experience i gave The Driskill 3 stars. I will definitely stay there but not eat there as there are some great restaurants in that area."
5,gem in austin,The historical hotel has enough renovations to maintain itself as a competitive quality hotel with so much charm and character! I felt the lobby and bar area had a good vibe and the dining experience was awesome for breakfast.
5,Really beautiful historic hotel,"You can read the very interesting history of this hotel in the room guide. Unfortunately I have a terrible memory so I can’t remember much of it, but it was interesting! This is a gorgeous historic hotel - I think the oldest in Austin - that has had presidents visit and even wait out their elections. There is fabulous memorabilia in the hallways on each floor, from the original owners. Also lots of beautiful paintings. The mezzanine is huge - great place for a wedding or other large gathering. The lobby is gorgeous - lots of marble. The main restaurant is sadly closed Sundays and Mondays (the nights we stayed) but the bar & grill had amazing buffalo wings, although the service was a little slow. The breakfast restaurant also had wonderful food, and great service. The main thing I noticed was the pristine condition the hotel is in. You can tell it’s been recently updated (carpets, drapes, etc), but it still has the feel of an old hotel.I believe it may have housed one of the first banks in Austin (don’t quote me on that). It has an original bank vault in the lobby with the original safe deposit boxes."
5,Nice Hotel,"The Driskill is a lovely historic hotel in the heart of downtown Austin. It’s a great place to visit...clean, elegant and friendly. The staff provided outstanding customer service. We appreciated the yellow rose left on our bed and loved the wine and chocolate birthday cake! We will return!"
5,Had a great week,"Great location, very clean and special hotel, will love to come back. pretty quiet in the room, and I loved the comfy bed. staff is very friendly and helpful, great bar in the hotel with nice music and food."
5,Best Wedding Venue in Texas,"The facilities and staff were amazing and the mezzanine reception was the perfect venue to end a magical day. The food, beverages and dessert were 5 stars. Thanks to all the staff for making my daughter's wedding even more special than it was."
5,Just plain nice. And historic. And nice.,"Great stay this week at The Driskill. Started off in advance with good communication with the property (Jeffrey) to arrange for a minifridge in the room (gratis) so we could keep our BBQ nice and cool.The place is gorgeous. Service is friendly. Room was a bit tight and ours had a view of another hotel across the alley (and they had better wifi) but we weren't staying there for the views! The location is excellent for the bars and clubs in the area and we walked down to the river each day. Great on site bar with live music, too."
5,The perfect weekend getaway,It was our first trip to the Driskill and it did not disappoint. The room was very comfortable and the hotel was more than expected from a building 200 yrs old. Dinner in the hotel was perfect as well. The check in staff and valet were above helpful. We can not wait to return.
4,Great history,A very clean but dated hotel that has a lot of character. We were glad we stayed for an evening but anything longer and we would have been very uncomfortable in the room as the air conditioning made the room very humid.
5,Stay Here,"Where better in Austin to stay to get access to 6th Street, capitol, and all that Austin has to offer. The rooms are spacious, service is over-the-top great. Food is very very special. Wonderful!We came from New York to Austin for the first time and are grateful that the Driskill was where our business meeting was scheduled. What a great hospitality experience all around!"
5,Beautiful Historic Hotel,I felt like we were at a cattle barons lodge. The hotel is beautiful and the lobby breathtaking. The rooms were amazing and full of historic pics and info. The food for breakfast was very tasty and selection was wonderful.
1,There are Much better options available,"As many others have commented, this location is in a Very Bad area! Overwhelming amount of homeless, drug addicts and aggressive beggars! I could not find one employee that actually liked working there.There are Much better options available"
5,Beautiful hotel,"The Driskill is a wonderful hotel. The lobby is gorgeous, with it’s beautiful ceiling and old fashioned safe deposit box door. The pictures in the hallways are a lovely touch, and the rooms were well-appointed. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially the valets."
5,I liked rolling my luggage through the crowded martini bar to the elevator.,"Staying there was great. After 7 PM two blocks away a taco stand opens streetside I recommend it, if you like tacos. The rest of the reviews will cover everything else. Why is there a 200 character minimum? On these reviews"
5,Texas Classic,"This timeless, classic Texas tradition just doesnt get any better- Bar is 2nd to none, atmosphere is classic. rooms are smaller than newer construction hotels but the room is every bit big enough.will stay again and again"
5,"Excellent Location, Ambiance and Service!","We appreciated The Driskill's central location in downtown Austin, close to restaurants, the music scene, museums, and the capitol. Historic architecture and decor in the gorgeous lobby, restaurant and bar added ambiance for our romantic vacation.Our queen petite room was spacious, attractive, comfortable and quiet. Bathroom was small, but functional. We wish the sink (basin) had been larger. High-quality towels, linens, shampoo and soap. Elevators occasionally had wait times.We felt welcomed by the service-oriented staff. Complimentary Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Austin American Statesman newspapers were available in the lobby.We would stay at The Driskill again!"
1,Historic means old,"Attending a wedding held in Austin and stayed at the Driskill for convenience. We got a junior suite since most activities were at night and we would be spending off hours in the room. Everything is outdated at the Driskill except the lobby and the bar area. Reminded me of a NYC hotel, all lobby, no room. The room furniture was worn, the walls marked up, hospitality and room service was archaic, and the bathroom was laughably small and cramped. With so many options in Austin, there is no reason to pay top dollar for a one star experience. The worst!"
5,Very nice!,Very nice hotel with great service!Its also right down in the heart of live music and night life!We ate at several of the restaurants and found the food to be great!Make sure you enjoy a great steak in their “ steak house “:
1,Bad Experience,My stay was awful because of how me and my family were treated. This was my son’s prom night and from the start my wife was basically tossed out of the hotel because we wanted to take a few pictures. Then we were followed around the hotel like we were thieves. Other senior students who were white were allowed to take pictures right in front of us without any hotel staff saying anything to them. They were not guests of the hotel like I was. This was the most upsetting experiences me and my family have ever endured. As a superintendent of schools this type of treatment would be unacceptable at any of my schools or functions.
5,Charm sets Driskill Hotel in a class of its own,The charm and history of this hotel is apparent with the first step through the doors. I thought it was unusual that so many reviews mentioned the wonder smell until we stepped inside. It truly does smell divine. Our room was lovely and so comfortable. Most of the staff I encountered had been with the hotel for years and spoke with great affection and pride about The Driskill. Can’t say enough nice things about this place.
5,LOVE the Driskill,"Had a fantastic stay, always consistent, excellent service, great location. There was a lot going on in the hotel but still very quiet. Only negative was valet took 45 minutes, would be nice to give guests a heads up on this so you know to call for car much sooner."
5,Downtown Austin,Great experience. Lots of attractions within walking distance. Staff was very helpful. It was nice to be in a hotel that did not resemble a chain. Lots of nice features to the hotel. the only thing missing was a pool.
4,Great time at the Driskill,"Location, location, location! The Driskill is conveniently located in the heart of the city. If you are staying over a weekend, you are in the perfect area to have the time of your life. The city closes off 6th street for a Bourbon-esque feel!The hotel in general is super cool. Rumored to be haunted, but in a good way. Service was good, and the bar area is always lively with live music."
5,Fantastic Hotel,"This was our first time staying at the Driskill after numerous recommendations. It did not disappoint. We were able to walk to all our destinations and we enjoyed the amenities the hotel had to offer. The room was comfortable and despite being by 6th Street, it was quiet. Would definitely stay here again."
3,"Lovely public spaces; teeny, tiny rooms.",Have a delicious breakfast and stay somewhere else.The public places are gorgeous and spacious. The breakfast room serves wonderful food. But the private hotel rooms are the smallest we've ever seen anywhere. Our windows looked out on the building next door--so close you could almost touch the building? Claustrophobic.
5,Conference,"Stayed at the Driskell for a conference. The conference was also at the Driskell. Conference facilities, food, hotel room, and bar were excellent. Would definitely go stay at the Driskell for a personal trip."
4,Business trip to Austin,"Lovely, renovated old hotel that is much more charming than a new high rise. The rooms feel like a throwback to the 19th century, but will modern-day comforts. The location is perfect for wandering the bustling streets of Austin."
5,A great old hotel with old fashioned excellent service and F&B.,"This was our second visit to the Driskill and we will be back. It’s nicely majestic and old world but with very modern room convenience. The staff were great, the breakfast as good as expected, we just love the place, and right there in the middle of the action in austin. It’s not cheap but if you want quality then you have to pay (mostly anyway)."
3,"Beautiful hotel, fine property. Service not the greatest.","We upgraded our room after we were sent an email telling us what was available for upgrade. We received a confirmation of the upgrade, but when we arrived, we were told that our upgrade was no longer available. The restaurant was poorly managed, at least for breakfast, we didn't attempt to eat there for other meals. This is the reason for the ""poor"" service rating. The pillows on the beds were very, very flat, this is the reason for the ""poor"" sleep quality rating. However, the wedding reception we attended was wonderful and the property and atmosphere was top-notch as well as the cleanliness of the property."
5,I'd stay again just for the smell,"Y'all... this hotel is my new favorite Austin hotel. The location is perfect, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the accommodations were absolutely perfect. I loved walking into the hotel after a day of exploring and felt the comfort and good smell (seriously) of the hotel."
4,Friend's Weekend,"Four couples, friends from high school, planned this special weekend in Austin and San Antonio. The Driscoll in Austin was chosen for its location and because of its history. It was very nice, and the staff was polite, but not very warm and friendly."
2,Not worth it!,"We only spent 1 night here thankfully. Location is very central, walking distance to lots of bars & restaurants. Staff friendly . The hotel is old & historic but it needs some work. The noise level was unbearable during the night. Every conversation in the hallway can be heard, every door closure, toilet flushes SO loud, & air con is loud. The hotel does not feel luxurious at all. You have to take 2 extremely slow elevators to get to your room. Don’t waste your $$ go elsewhere."
4,Need to be careful with this hotel,"You need to be careful with this hotel. Most of the reviews actually relate to the building and the bar, rather than the accommodation. Because of its ""historic"" nature the rooms are not all similar in quality. Rooms that end with ..01 are next to the lifts. Room 421 has huge air conditioning units outside the windows which means for people who are sensitive to the sound of a ""jet engine"" landing in your room, best to avoid it. Having said that the staff did their best to re-accommodate us and were fairly pleasant about it. We were shown a room that had no view with frosted windows so that you don't look out at a brick wall. Check the room before settling in. The bar is interesting and you feel you are having an authentic texan experience. As with other comments on tripadvisor the wait staff can be abrupt and passive aggressive. Would recommend it, but with caution."
3,"Ending a weekend of visiting family in Central Texas with a night at the Driskill in Austin, TX","The Driskill has a long standing tradition as one of the iconic places to stay in Austin. It has a great history and is centrally located to Austin's city life.. The physical fetures are beautiful and the rooms are a delight to the eye with the high ceilings. Unfortunately, our first room had some issues. There were chocolate covered strawberries on the desk along with a small bottle of champagne in a bucket of melted warm, water that had obviously been there for a long time, which does not speak well for housekeeping. I called the front desk who did not know anything about the strawberries. The gentleman indicated we could keep the warm bottle of champagne. The rug had a large bump running the length of the room and my wife was concerned about someone tripping over it. Sure enough, this caused me to trip, (and having had multiple joint replacements and back surgeries), could have been painful. We asked and were given another room. We meet the enginner who came to look at the rug. He indicted that they had known about this for some time, This does speak to a certain callous disregard for the safety of the guests. The new room was nice. However, the bathroom door had a nosey creak that would have been perfect for a horror movie! My wife and I learned to just leave it ajar. That evening we went to theThe Driskill Bar which lived up to its famous reputation. The atmosphere was delightful; the service was excellent as were the drinks and food! The next morning we had a late breakfast at the Driskill's 1886 Cafe and Bakery. Looking at the quality food being delivered to the guests around us really worked up our appetite. We ordered the poppy seed biscuit and sausage gravy covered with a scrambled egg. This was simply fabulous. Unfortunately, the service from our server was pathetic. He was slow to respond, forgot to bring us items that were requested, etc.There are good qualities to the Hotel Driskill but the negatives influenced our overall rating of 3 stars out of 5"
5,Beautiful hotel.,Beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Austin. Great location and centrally located to restaurants and local sights. Food at the restaurant was delicious and the staff could not have been more helpful. Rather costly but very nice.
3,"Great location. Average service,","The Driskill is perfectly located. On 6th Street and one block from Congress. Lots of history. Good restaurants.However, maid service was wanting. Out of the room for four hours between 10 am and 2 pm, but no cleaning was done. Instead of knocking and asking if you need towels or trash taken out, they slip a note under your door. If you don't notice it for a couple of hours you're out of luck. The maids have gone home.Also, bathroom shower area was microscopic. I realize it is an old hotel from the 1880s with limited room, but come on."
5,"The Driskill Hotel, Austin TX","Parking, fees and Taxes will add about $100 to the bill, but that's not the fault of the hotel. Other than that, this place is an exceptional, comfortable and all around cool place to stay, I will recommend it every time."
5,Best hotel experience ive ever had,"From check in to check out I had the best experience ive ever had at a hotel. The room was ready when we arrived with out specifications we requested. The hotel was beautiful, the staff were helpful, the food was great."
3,"""Deluxe"" ... Really??","I'm a native Texan who has long appreciated the lovely Driskill from afar, and finally had an opportunity to stay, for leisure, with my spouse, this past weekend. What a mistake!I booked a ""Deluxe King"" and I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a hotel room in this price category. I walked in and before I even set my bags down, I went back to reception assuming they'd given us the wrong one. I figured there's no way the room (516) we were given is an upgrade from ANYTHING on this lovely property.Here's a breakdown of what you get with this particular ""deluxe"" king:- Tall, grand windows... that look directly into the exterior wall of another building. Like a joke about a fleabag NY hotel or apartment. Pull back the big, luxe curtains, and voila! A dank cement wall. Why bother having a window?- The website says rooms in this category have ""350 to 425"" sq feet. Yet in this room, you can sit on the bed and reach out, with your hand, and grab both TV stand at the foot of the bed, and the side walls by the bed. The nightstand is wedged between the bed and the wall (literally crammed in there) and there's just enough space at the foot to squeeze between the bed and TV if you keep your arms at your side.- The bathrooms are ""upgraded"" / ""renovated"" and yet are strangely shoddy. Super white, high-gloss, bare walls and gas station lighting, complete with mismatched bulbs on the vanity. There's non-existent water pressure and we had two faulty shower heads in the four-nozzle ""spa"" shower. The shower leaked through its caulking onto the floor around the toilet.- The website claims that these rooms have a ""separate sitting area"" which I guess in 516 is the one little chair and weirdly huge ottoman crammed in the corner by the windows? So you can sit in the little chair and stare at the view of the brick wall? (Not quite the ""sleeper sofas or two leisure chairs"" pictured on the bait-and-switch photos on their website room gallery.)What a cramped, leaky, dreary bummer. With so many new cool or luxury hotels in Austin, I feel like a complete dummy for booking the Driskill. (And I especially feel bad about raving about it to the point where I booked it again.) Enjoy it from the outside and stay somewhere else."
5,Weekend getaway,"A very unique hotel that has a lot of charm. Close to great restaurants and night life. A bit pricy, but worth the experience. Has a lot of amenities and prompt service. Just a few minute wait walk to the state capital."
5,The Driskill - Hyatt Globalist,This hotel is pure class and has active night life. Staff is amazing. Loved the high ceilings in rooms and classical look. A nice weekend getaway and reward nights well spent. Would certainly go again
4,Beautiful historic building in great location!,"The building is absolutely gorgeous and the staff was mostly welcoming. We stayed in a city view the first night, and the LBJ suite the second night. The basic rooms are a bit of a let-down, and have no amenities like coffee, and water is not free. The biggest disappointment was the cleanliness; the bathrooms just weren't very clean. I'd consider staying here again, as the location is great and the building is breathtaking, but they need to seriously revisit the cleaning standards."
4,Wonderful Hotel but needs some attention to details,"This historic hotel is wonderful in most respects-location, ambience, food, rooms. However, our shower wouldn’t work & even after being fixed was still very difficult to use. As Hyatt members we were offered 2 complimentary bottles of water but were charged for them on our bill. They offered late checkout which we accepted but then locked us out of our room."
5,One of my favorite hotels!,"Can't go wrong with a stay at this historic and beautiful hotel ... great staff, great rooms, absolutely stellar food service. I look forward to coming back for a longer stay! The bed was perfect, and the room very comfortable and well laid out. If I have a suggestion, it's to put a better desk chair for business travelers in the room; the chair is attractive but not very ergonomic."
4,Very nice hotel but not perfect,"The hotel is situated on 6th street which used to be much nicer but is now full of homeless people and the noise from the street permeates the rooms facing the street. We were on the 5th floor overlooking the street and there is daily noise (club music, cars, motorcycles) till around 2am.Service at the hotel bar is not great with servers taking a really long time to take an orderInteracted with the concierge twice and both times seemed clueless as to what to recommend for dinner etc. We did better by just looking for dining choices on pentacle or trip advisor."
4,Historic and well located,"You can't get much more central than The Driskill. It's right on 6th Street, which can be good or bad depending on your desire to be close to the wild bars and night clubs. That said, the rooms were quiet and relaxed, and the place has that Old World grandeur that makes you feel like a wealthy cattle rancher. Rooms and beds were really comfortable. We upgraded to the Deluxe King and felt it was worth it. The bathrooms were clean and modern. The one negative was the wifi, which didn't work on my Mac laptop the entire time we were there."
5,40th Celebration!,Loved the older historic style of the hotel. Food was wonderful. Located where you can't get bored:-)) Sooo much to do right out your front door. We had a group of 23 who traveled from CA and we had a great time!!
5,Lovely historic hotel,"Pricey but lovely. Had the small queen room but was much roomier then expected. Bathroom was very small. Hotel staff were very nice and helpful. Location is fabulous, the Capitol building is just up the street."
1,Think Twice Before Booking - Extremely Sad Experience,"From the very cold reception, to the worn out condition of the rooms, clogged sinks, worse housekeeping - had to call room service as they had missed doing the room in the morning. Do not take breakfast with the room. I had to wait close to an hour for a table and it is ala carte. All this after paying $500 per day for a standard room."
4,Anniversary Celebration,"Hotel is located well, very well preserved property, staff very attentive, only had breakfast however decor was well done and service was good. Took the upgrade with balcony enjoyed being outside, however construction noise was intensified."
5,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great service, nicely appointed rooms, very comfortable bed. The lobby bar has a fun happy hour with music!Very good breakfast at hotel restaurant. All was reasonably priced for this quality."
5,The Awesome Driskill Hotel,"The Driskill Hotel is an Austin institution, built in 1886 they say more politics was conducted here than in the Capital Building on Congress.President LB Johnson had a suit at the hotel. The place just oozes history from the incredible lobby to the paintings that adorn this amazing hotel. If you are in Austin and not staying here it is still worth popping in for a look.The bar is the hub in the evening with quality live music every evening, check out the pistols and Spurs used as light fittings, all original.The hotel has class and it is busy so if you are going to stay over in Austin at least check it out you won’t be disappointed.The Rooms; we had a 2 room suite with a large bedroom with a high ceiling and a living space with comfortable chairs and a sofa, there was a writing desk and chair. Both rooms had a large flat screen TV.The bathroom was a good size with a shower over the bath. A safe was hidden in the bathroom cupboard and robes were supplied.The only minor inconvenience was no drawers to store clothes which seemed quite an oversight given the size of the 2 rooms."
4,Old World needs updating,"Hotel overall needs updating. Bedrooms very old/no full-length mirror. Very small bathrooms - yes, old hotel, but could have more modern appointments. Front desk clueless as to what is available in hotel and in the neighborhood. Concierge, Chris, Super. Driskill Grill Maitre'D, Kevin: Super. Would look at other hotels in area - in same nice neighborhood."
3,Austin landmark,"I love this old hotel, especially the bar which has live music and a lot of character. The location is great. I found the service to be underwhelming except for the bar staff and $4 for a cup of coffee seemed a bit steep.The bar staff was friendly and efficient but I found the rest of the staff to be not so friendly. The cleaners were speaking extremely loudly in the hallway at 9am Sunday morning, valet staff was also not so friendly. Our waiter in the restaurant seemed very stressed.I will say that I asked for the bathroom door to be oiled so I wouldn’t wake my family on one of my frequent trips to the bathroom and that was resolved quickly and efficiently."
4,A nice hotel,"This hotel was nice - but not great. The rooms are a bit tired and need a refurb. The beds are comfortable though and the room (junior suite) was a good size. It easily accommodated our baby in a porta-cot. The housekeeping staff were very nice, as were the staff at the bar.We ate and drank at the bar twice and the atmosphere was good."
5,Lovely Stay,"Several of my family members stayed at the Driskill in early April, 2019 to attend a wedding. We were all pleased with our rooms and staff. It does seems a little expensive but we did enjoy staying there and hope to be back someday."
5,"The Driskill - Austin, TX","All staff were very friendly and helpful. Check in and out was a breeze. Hotel is exceptionally clean. Awesome mocha from the breakfast café, best in the city. Great live music in the bar & grille. This is a great site for both a personal trip or a business meeting."
5,Wonderful Hotel!,"This is a beautiful hotel. I stayed in a room with two queen beds, and though I did not find them very comfortable (due to my own health issues), I believe most visitors would. They are reasonably but not very firm. The mattress does have a pillowtop.The bathroom was pretty and private enough that you could access the sink but shut off the bathtub and toilet for privacy for more than one person staying there. The closet had good hangers, robes (which I didn't need, but still), and the closet light goes off or on automatically when you shut the closet door. There is a keyed safe in the closet, big enough for a tablet or small laptop and jewelry. There are plenty of snacks in room (which I also did not use). The room was quiet, and the curtains really did black out at least 95% of the exterior light.I'm very glad my company chose this hotel for us to stay in and have our meetings."
5,Great hotel...not so great neighborhood,"Hotel is beautiful, staff is great, the food spectacular. Step outside and the homeless people are all over the place. I live in NYC and it's nothing compared to Austin. There are at least 8-10 homeless per block and they are super aggressive. It's a shame..its like the hotel is in the wrong place. If you're looking to party, the bars and entertainment are right there and if you dont mind the aggressiveness of the homeless people then def stay here. Otherwise look outside the neighborhood where its quieter."
5,Why leave?,"Great old hotel with lots of history. Walked up to check in and guest was ripping on staff about lack to tp in their room. When my turn came I asked for a room with tp and they took care of it with a smile. 6st was a little dicey for us at night, so the Driskill bar was a fantastic haven."
5,Anniversary Splurge,"Close to all the action. Make sure you have dinner at the Driskill Grill one night- unbelievably good steak and sides, fairly priced. Also spent several nights in the Driskill pub, listening to great live music. Had breakfast at the 1886 cafe and the Eureka, across the street, both good. Irish pub just up the block had great Irish music during the day, and authentic blues band at night- no cover!"
5,Experience of a lifetime!,"I chose the Driskill to do something I hope I never have to again...propose to my girlfriend! The experience was amazing from start to finish- from the helpful concierge, Chris, to the head of the kitchen, Erika, I was completely blown away at how they went out of their way to help make our special day come true.Overall, the room was great- very large, modern and clean. The only downside was the view in an interior room, but outside of that, this hotel met and exceeded all of my expectations."
3,not worth the price,The lobby and restaurants are nice and the location is good. However the rooms need to be refurbished! I would not stay here again unless I heard that they had done a lot of work on their guest rooms.
5,Best location in Austin,"A very elegant hotel in the center of the action. Great breakfast and lunch. Nice bar area with live music for dinner. Quiet exercise room. Beautiful decorations and paintings. Very quiet rooms. Overall, an excellent hotel to stay at."
3,Staying at the Driskill,"Beautiful and historical hotel Lobby and Exterior. Rooms were clean. Otherwise if you end up in an interior room, the view does not exist and it will be dark. I much prefer to stay at a newer hotel with better amenities and lighting. Downtown Austin is full of homeless folks and they congregate around the Driskill and much of downtown."
5,the driskill is for ballers,"beautiful, clean rooms. super friendly staff that goes above and beyond. DELICIOUS 1886 cafe and bakery. good live music. loved our stay here. and i need to have a bunch more characters to reach the 200 minimum."
5,Beautiful Historic Building,Stayed here for a multi-day meeting and the accommodations were really nice. Food served was great and staff was very helpful. Bedding was very comfortable and loved the pillows. The building is beautiful and very historic and the room I was in was actually appropriated with a white noise machine which I did use because the first night the person in the room above must have been very restless because lots of creaking boards above (or was it a ghost!! LOL)
4,"Hot room, then no view but nice staff and hotel","I paid for an upgraded room and was allowed to check in early which was nice. When we got to our very nice room (545) it had no air and was very hot and it couldn't be fixed while we were at lunch so they did move us to another room. However, the new room certainly didn't appear to be an upgrade and only had 1 window up so high you couldn't see out of it. Overall the room was disappointing and the fact I didn't get my paid for upgrade didn't seem right, but the people were very nice and the hotel was nice and in a great location."
5,Great Historic Hotel,"Stayed here recently on a trip with friends. Our room was spacious with twin queens. The bath was large with two sinks, one on the outside of the bath. We had breakfast every day at the 1886 Bakery. The have great variety and the food was delicious. There is a fantastic bar on the mezzanine which also serves food. This is a fantastic choice for a statin Austin."
5,Great Stay at the Driskill,"Room was quiet. Bed and sheets were so comfy! Valet was extremely helpful in getting me into the hotel during SXSW festivities. Location is excellent as you can leave the car and walk to everything on 6th and Congress. Bar was the best with great staff, drinks, food and entertainment. Many people visited just to see the hotel and most said this is where we need to stay next time!"
5,"Clean, historic, very responsive",The Queen bed was small and they were able to accomodate us to a Kind Bed. The Bell Boy service was stellar and the front staff was kind and friendly. Very content with our visit. The staff was very responsive.
4,a hotel with atmosphere,"When we arrived the car was taken care of by the valet. Already entering the big hall leadingto the reception area gave a great feeling for the history of the building. I was given a corner room in the tower, which was excellent with a view in two directions without beeing noisy. I had a quick drink in the cosy bar before going for dinner and another the following day before going to the airport.All in all a very confortable stay."
5,High Class Dining,EVery meal I have had at the Driskill has been a great experience. The service is old fashioned - meaning GREAT! The food has always been outstanding. If we are in Austin at Thanksgiving we always have the Thanksgiving Buffet (if we can remember to get reservations early enough.
1,Pass.,"The Driskill is a hard pass. It’s old, noisy, musty and expensive. The hotel is historic, I get it, but it has not been maintained. The room carpets are dirty (wear slippers!). The musti-ness was hard to overcome and we wound up taking allergy medicine just to deal with the smell. You know how some hotels have a big carafe of coffee for guests? Not so here. A cup of black coffee was $4. Crazy. You can pop in here to maybe look at the architecture or have a bev at the bar, but do yourself a favor and skip staying here. 👎🏻"
3,"Nice looks, loud room","The hotel and room are beautiful. This hotel is located in a really good location in the middle of everything and the view and sound deadening to the outside is superior. Unfortunately, this room (1201) had almost no sound deadening from the hallway. I could easily hear the elevators working, hallway conversations, and other guests filling ice at all hours. Unless you are coming off of Sixth Street after a night of partying, it will be difficult to sleep in this room. I found the bed and pillows to be uncomfortable."
5,Trip to the Legislature,The Driskill is the place to stay when visiting the Capital. Just an excellent hotel property that puts you in the Texas spirit. The restaurants and balconies overlooking the streets are an excellent gathering place.
4,Quaint Beautiful Space,"The Driskill is a great place for a unique stay. Conveniently located, staff was exceptional. Rooms were quaint. Great bar for dining and entertainment. Definitely recommend if you are staying in downtown Austin."
5,The Driskill,"The Driskill is conveniently located in the Warehouse District of Austin Texas. Music was great, food was great also. Walking distance to bars, restaurants and shopping. I would definitely stay there again."
5,The Driskill,I love the Driskill. The live entertainment and lounge is so relaxing. Great food and drinks. The downstairs restaurant for breakfast is amazing and staff is beyond friendly. The location is perfect and centrally located.
5,JollyRogerAdventures,"This was a last minute adventure, we were celebrating Texas Independence Day and my birthday and a quick weekend get-away. The location is great and the staff when out of their way and surprised us with a room delivery birthday cake that was deliciously good. I can't say enough how nice everyone was. Thank you."
5,Historic hotel with fine accommodations,"Aside from rumors of haunting, this was a lovely old (yet updated) hotel. Best part was the incredibly kind and helpful staff. The room was a bit small compared to chain hotels, and the pedestal sink in the bathroom made it a challenge for blow drying and flat ironing and putting on makeup. But, for a short business stay it was great!"
4,Great location in downtown Austin,"Nice historic hotel in downtown Austin. On the pricey side, but probably worth it. However, a hotel like this should at least give you a bottle of water In the room. Also, turndown service is a special request. We did have it once, the curtains were not even drawn but they did leave a rose on the bed!"
1,Room 513 seriously ?,Booked based on reviewsGot a pricey suite with no windows next to air conditioning outside unit. Just the gloomiest experience for a long time.Noisy crappy room.Hotel booked up. No other optionsSo I am still wondering why the ratings on this crappy hotel.
2,Disappointed at Driskill,"When we arrived at 8pm the lamps and AC were off. This was one of their executive suites, with the large balcony on the 4th floor. There was a hacked up old steak in the fridge and the mini bar wasn't all the way stocked. The sheets were pilled and worn looking. The furniture had at once been nice, stately pieces but now have tears and stains. For the price, I would not recommend a stay here until this property is renovated. Pros are beautiful deck outlooking 6th Street and access to all the bars there, also the lobby is gorgeous and valet service is helpful. The staff did correct the steak and sheets issue when they were made aware."
3,Worth a walk though or a drink at the bar- but don't stay at the hotel,great historic building which oozes historybar scene is lively and crowed but funfood was good both in room and at the restaurants.Definitely worth going in for a drink- but hotel part is a let down.Rooms need more maintenance to clean mold out of showers- paint over rust etc Too many other great options in AUS at that price point. High number of homeless around hotel.
5,The Driskill A CLASSIC HOTEL,"From check in to check out, the staff went above and beyond Aracella(bell stand), Luther, Front Desk Christy, Concierge, and Blake(Valet) were all extremely professional friendly and courteous! The Driskill is a classic hotel and it lives up to its reputation. Everyone knows about the fabulous design and the lovely views. Austin and The Driskill They just go together!"
5,I had a great stay here,"Historic hotel. I had a beautiful big clean room with a great bed. Ceiling fan kept the bedroom comfortable. Sitting room had a comfortable couch and desk. Very large and spacious bathroom, including a huge walk-in shower area with two nozzles and a big deep soaking tub. I have seen some bad reviews here, but I had nothing to complain about."
3,Our overpriced stay at The Driskell,We supposedly had a Jr suite but it seemed more like a basic size room for any other hotel. Was quite disappointed for the price and the historic value of the place. The furniture in the room seemed as though they had been to yard sales and then places various styles in the room from contemporary to Victorian.
5,The Driskill is a must see!,"We recently held a global team meeting at the Driskill Hotel for 18 people. The team flew in from all over the world and the were thrilled with the accommodations, service, and overall atmosphere at the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive to all our needs. I would highly recommend this hotel for an event or personal vacation."
2,Not inpressed.,"The location is good, but that is only thing good about this place. the service is so-so, need better management, we were told during check-in, we had late checkout, but after 11:00am, we were locked out. the room is old and has some smell, we have turn on AC to clear it. The text message to pick up our car was not working for us either, after 10 minutes of texting and when we went downstairs, they forgot about it."
5,Great Place to Stsy,Awesome hotel excellent staff the decor was fabulous I would stay here any time I was in Austin. Great area around hotel when I arrive I valet and leave it there til time to leave. You can walk or take a cab to the State Capitol. There are many restaurants in the general area.
5,The Driskill is a first-class establishment with a first-class+ price tag.,"If you have the resources ($$$), there may not be a better place to stay in Austin. This hotel leaves no detail unattended. The restaurants and bars are top notch, the service is outstanding and the location can't be beat. Be prepared for $45/night valet parking."
3,Driskill,We have come to like the Driskill. I got an email for $5.00 extra a night they would upgrade my room. Not in 511. Queen size bed and mattress from the 1800. That was spooky. And the doors squeecked so bad it was awful. And a 19” TV. Did not know they still made those. Be careful to check out the room before unloading your belongings.
5,Wonderful Stay,"The beds and pillows we so great. The staff more than accommodated me, special request. Great service for food and beverage, though bar closed a bit early...I would recomend the Driskill for the location alone"
5,We won't stay anywhere else!,"We love this place but this was a rough stay as our 6 year old daughter got sick. The staff that night were amazing! They handled the situation with kindness and promptness! Gave us time to get her cleaned up and bathed, pack and moved us to another room without hesitation! Had the bed and sofa bed ready when we walked in the new room! We are grateful and my daughter did not feel embarrassed for being sick! Love the bar and entertainment! As always, the breakfast is the best!"
5,Ascensus TPA Solutions Conference,"Having never been to Austin before, staying at the Driskill Hotel certainly made the trip both worthwhile and memorable! The staff was welcoming and courteous, the food was exceptional and the the room was comfortable. When I visit Austin again, I plan to stay at the Driskill again!"
3,Great common areas but room was yuck.,"This is a grand hotel with a beautiful lobby, exquisite restaurant and legendary happy hour at the bar but the ROOM was small, damp and smelled like mold/mildew. The room was yuck. Not worth the money at all. Visit but don't stay there."
3,"Atmospheric, historic hotel","Interesting and historic old hotel with some nice touches. Pretty much what it promises on its website, with a few exceptions. Bathroom was tiny, with a shower that was almost impossible to use. The room rate was reasonable, One major complaint was the rate for valet parking--$45 per night. This may be the norm for New York or LA but seems very high for Austin.To make it worse, on the morning of our departure the valet when to get our car, then had to come back because he forgot to take the key. All told we had to wait almost half an hour for our car!"
3,Some disappointments,The place is all it is claimed to be in terms of historic nature. The location is central for walking to attractions in Austin. The food was a mixed bag; wings and quesadillas in the bar were OK. Some breakfast items were good but I found the huevos rancheros to be nothing like I'm used to [potatoes/ground beef/tabasco]. Service was very good until it came to checking out. We called the Bell desk for help with luggage; after a delay we called again and were told again someone would be up soon. After further delay we made 2 trips and hauled our own luggage down to the car. At these prices the service ought to be much better than this.
5,Business Conference,The Ritz has nothing on this hotel when it comes to guest service. The hotel staff is more than gracious and go out of their way to make your stay memorable. In the 20 years I have been traveling I don't recall better service.
1,Horrible Expereince,"Don't ever stay at this horrible hotel. I and several colleagues were locked out of our rooms on more than one occasion. Security was not able to fix the problem and I was left in the lobby in the middle of the night with no communication on the situation and no offer of placement in another hotel. Had to spend the night in a rollaway bed in a colleagues room when he returned from a night out and found me stranded on a couch in the lobby. I am a sales professional with over 30 years of travel experience. I HAVE NEVER HAD A WORSE EXPERIENCE!!! I was attending a conference hosted by the hotel. We had over 75 rooms reserved. I was not the only one in my party who was locked out with no way to get back in. For my trouble I received an apology note that made light of my experience with a plate of ""beef jerky"". Can't make it up. STAY AWAY!!"
5,Driskill Hotel,This is a great hotel to have a business meeting. The facilities are very nice. The staff is very responsive and helpful. The food was outstanding. I will certainly use this hotel again for personal as well as business.
5,Stunning Hotel,"The Driskill is one of the few ""older"" hotels that rises way above the average hotel.It is steeped in history but offers most of the 21st century amenities. I would suggest reading up on the history of the hotel first before embarking on this little adventure!You must spend some time in the bar area of the hotel - they offer free truffle popcorn and beef jerky - you won't be disappointed!Whilst I was there there was live music in the bar area - of course, it's Austin TX!"
5,Great property and staff equals an amazing place to stay,"I travel about 30 weeks per month, mostly business and mostly mid stream hotels on occasion I catch a break and stay in an upscale property and I'll tell you the experience at Driskill damn near matched the best of the best at a much more approachable cost. 1) The property is so unique 2) The current level of finishes from carpet to paint to bathrooms was all clean looking nice with no signs of wear & tear. 3) The cafe and the bar offered creative menus, nice ambiance, and attentive people 4) The best part... the team of people working there - KC one Managers greeted me at check-in and helped coordinate some logistics. Chris at the Concierge desk hooked us up with tickets at a ""sold out"" show, wow! Fred and others in the lounge made Super Bowl Sunday awesome. Now add the amazing vibe of an 1800's hotel but with all the amenities of 2019 and then the location walking distance to everything and if you don't feel like walking scooters are everywhere around town. This place makes people smile."
5,Weekend for wedding,"Excellent experience at the Driskill - glad we were there- staff and all individuals we encountered were delightful, helpful- food and restaurant choices excellent- rooms excellent and in character with age of the buildings, yet completely updated and slick design and clean"
5,"Gorgeous Old World Elegance,","Arrange for a tour guide to set up a tour of the Driskill Hotel. The Driskill is so much more than I had expected. It is a Cattle Baron Palace. I spent 4 nights in this delightful gem. I am already thinking about my next trip. The Cattle Baron’s Suite was a marvelous place to hideout and take my naps between excursions to the I-Max, and The Bullock State Museum, the LBJ Library, and Ransome House I walked to them all from The Driskill. I dined at a different restaurant every night, walking to each one. I walked to the Capital building too. I only used a taxi once, when I took a cab to UMLAUF’s Sculpture Garden, even then I walked back by way of the river walk. God Loved Texas, and shed his grace on Austin. The Driskill is a gorgeous gem in a beautiful city. I love it, I feel as though Texas adopted me durin my stay."
5,Historic and updated,The rooms have modern beautiful baths and the lobby and bar are still historic and so Texan. The perfect place to stay in Austin. Make sure you get the handouts about ghosts and history from the front desk
5,Old but still Grand,"Front desk and bell staff were exceptional at check-in and storing luggage at check out, loading it into the Uber and handing us bottled water every time we left the hotel. Although our junior suite could have used new carpeting, it came with a white noise machine (!). The sitting room entry was at least 25 feet high, maybe 30 feet, something one rarely finds to be sure. Music in the Bar was great too, no cover charge, unlike the [Truly] Broken Spoke, which I also reviewed on this trip - stay at the Driskill Bar if you want good music, good food, good wine and good dancing too."
5,Outstanding 4-day event held at The Driskill,We held our annual Sales Kickoff at The Driskill this year for approximately 50 people. The location and venue were the perfect choice for our team as we were celebrating a stellar year. Kurt and the event management team went out of their way to accommodate us - especially with last minute changes. Like was to Anthony and the PSAV Team who made things seamless (NOT ONE TECHNICAL ISSUE THE ENTIRE WEEK!). Can't say enough good things about this location.
5,The Driskill in January,"Central to everything downtown, great food and drink specials at the daily happy hour. The lobby cafe was some of the best food during our trip. The staff seemed happy and were very accommodating! We will be staying here again:)"
1,No one cares......,Hyatt top membership. Check in was terrible. Room was cold. Staff seemed to truly not care that our company dropped over $100K at hotel. Man at front desk at check in wanted to sell me on better room and was rude to me. Bizarre experience. Do not think people at hotel are trained or care.
5,Great hotel in downtown Austin,"Stayed on 6th street at the historic Driskill hotel. Wonderful experience at the hotel, and you are walking distance to lots of places to visit. The room was the right size for 2. The bar is all wood with Texas history pieces surrounding the room."
1,Reservations - don’t waste your time,"I am supposed to be staying at this property as part of a room block for an event ... after four calls to the property - three of which went straight to an automated Hyatt reservation system and one in which the bored phone attendant insisted there was no one who could help me at the property (“I told you they are ALL in a meeting!”) and all she could do was connect me to the automated system, I may just tough it out somewhere else. Per the website, the Driskill is booked for these dates so that’s not helpful either."
5,Beautiful Historic Hotel; Great Location; Great Service,"I'm a Hyatt Globalist (top-tier status) and I booked a very cheap member rate in their smallest room type (petite queen)I was upgraded to a Deluxe King on a high floor at check-in without asking (no suites available unfortunately). The room was very nice and large; probably about 450 square feet. I was extremely happy with it.When I arrived at my room, there was an amenity waiting for me: 2 bottles of local beer on ice, and a bowl of what appeared to be home-made beef jerky. Amenities for globalists are no longer Hyatt policy, but many hotels still provide them. This is a nice touch and always appreciated. It shows that the hotel appreciates their customers, and is willing to go a little above and beyond the requirements. Both the beer and the jerky were very good.One benefit of Globalist is free breakfast. They provided a $100/day credit at the cafe in the lobby of the restaurant. This is well above and beyond what is required or expected (breakfast there will generally cost $25/person). The place is quite busy (it's open to the public and very popular) but you can call from your room and reserve a spot with about 20-30 minutes notice, so this wasn't a problem. The food was great. I was there for a week, which gave me a chance to try something different every day (there is a lot of selection on the menu) and everything was very good. Out of all the Hyatts I've stayed at, this is probably my favorite breakfast.The Globalist ""free water"" benefit was provided through the mini bar. This wasn't as seamless as I'd have liked (sometimes charges would show up on the folio, but they were quickly removed upon request -- still, it would be better if you didn't have to ask)The location of this hotel can't be beat -- you are right downtown, and a very short walk to lots of great bars and restaurants, as well as the State Capitol. I'm usually not big on tourist attractions, but it's a beautiful building and worth walking to on a sunny day. A short and cheap lyft ride will get you to some places that are a bit further away -- either east of the highway (for some great breweries -- definitely visit the local breweries if you like beer) or south of the river for some more good food. The concierge was very helpful in recommending places.Overall, I had a great trip and the hotel was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoyed Austin and will definitely be back, and I'll stay at the Driskill every time."
3,Avoid interior rooms!,Beautiful property with many quietly elegant Hyatt touches.. but do anything you can to avoid interior rooms! Old building has structural columns all over the place that make navigating small rooms almost impossible. So bad I had to iron my shirt in the hallway!
5,The Driskill - a historic hotel well preserved,"The Driskill is a historic hotel and given we were only spending one night wanted the experience to be memorable. The hotel exceeded our expectations as far as location, “feel,” hospitality and quality of food. Highly recommended."
5,Beautiful Historic Hotel,"We stayed at the Driskill for a weekend. In the heart of Austin, its a beautiful historic hotel. Its a Hyatt property. The service is great. The location is perfect for walking in downtown. Rooms are nice and comfortable. Its a renovated historic hotel so the rooms are cozy. The bar has nightly live music. Its a happening place right inside the hotel. Would gladly come back again."
5,Beautiful!,"Loved all the woodwork in his place. Beautifully done throughout with grand lobby. Rooms very nice, even hallways upscale. Very attentive and pleasant staff. At $158 a night in December thought it was very reasonable for downtown Austin. Only regrets was that Austin rush hour a horror (even for folks from NY) and hotel restaurant closed for the night (a Monday). Had a nice light dinner in the bar though - as it seemed did everyone else. Nice jazz quartet playing."
5,Historic Gem in Downtown Austin,"I stay in The Driskill every time I go to Austin. It's a Hyatt property (good news if you are a Hyatt member), but it retains all of the charm of the original, historic hotel. The staff at the hotel are great. Sydney Smith worked with me on getting my reservation booked at a good rate. And I see Patrick in the 1886 Cafe & Bakery every time I come and he always remembers me and welcomes me back. You also can't beat the location in the heart of downtown Austin. It's an older property with a ton of history and charm. If you are looking for 'sleek and hip' - keep looking, but if you are looking to walk back into history, this is the place."
5,Historic hotel,"Beautifully restored historic hotel in great location downtown Austin, TX. Celebrating 150 years. Rooms nice and comfortable. Staff very nice and service oriented. Within walking distance of many great restaurants and bars."
5,The Driskill is Great!,"We stay at the Driskill anytime we can. It's in a great location, has ton of history and just simply meets our needs. We'll be back soon. It's a first class property with a first class staff. Always ask if upgrades are possible. They have some cool rooms."
5,The Beautiful Driskill combined with exceptional service and the amazing cinnamon rol!!!,"My wife who was visiting Austin and this incredible historic property for the first time was absolutely stunned. She basically said I undersold the experience. We travel globally and our stay here with incredible staff,overall hotel beauty and dining has this as a top Hyatt property in our book. We had interactions with all levels of individuals during and after our stay. Each and everyone is a solid ambassador of this property. We had the fortune to eat breakfast at the lovely 1886 cafe and bakery.The breakfast was outstanding combined with great service,but the standouts were the baked goods. The Chocolate croissant was amazing very light. The real standout is the cinnamon roll which more resembles a cinnamon loaf. This was undoubtedly the best baked good item we ever consumed. We brought one home and shared with our family who were also head over heels. I STRONGLY suggest you run and don't walk to indulge in a delicious cinnamon roll. We will be be back to The Driskill every time we visit Austin."
5,Historic Beauty with Exceptional Service,"Part of the Hyatt brand, this hotel is historic, beautiful and stunning. She is a gem that is very well cared for. There is so much attention to detail and preservation of history that you will not believe it. Original chandeliers from the 1800's. The staff is very knowledgeable as well on the history of The Driskill. Located near 6th street, the hotel has a wonderful café, exceptional steakhouse and incredible bar with live music. The rooms are small but very historic and a great deal of detail and care has been put into them, from luxury robes to monogramed sinks. I stayed in room 539 with a great view of 6th street. We had a business meeting and held a private dinner at the steakhouse. Let me say, their wine selections are incredible. Kurt Ashcraft went out of his way as Events Manager to make our stay memorable and over the top. The customer service is exceptional!"
5,Anniversary weekend,My wife wanted to stay at this location for a very long time. It was our anniversary weekend. The safe was very friendly. They showed us around. They told us about all the places nearby to visit. All the great restaurants close by to try. The room was very organized. Loved the history of the building. Can't wait to visit this location again.
5,Beautiful hotel,"Amazing hotel, can’t fault it. Only stayed here one night on our journey through Texas but this was my favourite hotel of the trip. Rooms are beautifully decorated, whole place is immaculate and it’s in a great location for exploring and in walking distance of bars and restaurants."
5,Enjoyed the stay,Throughly enjoyed our stay. My husband and I had never stayed there. Always wanted to and it did not disappoint. Will definitely be staying again next time we are back in Austin which is about one a month.
5,Beautiful Old Downtown Hotel,"On a recent vacation we had the pleasure of staying at the Driskill. It is a beautiful, historic hotel. The lobby has lots of places to sit and people-watch, the bar is cozy but large -- no small feat. We had breakfast at the cafe and dinner at the grill, and both were great. I would definitely like to stay at this hotel again."
3,Anniversary,We found roaches in the bathtub and alerted front desk on checkout. Desk clerk did not seem bothered by this. The Valet staff was excellent. The coffee and pastries were delicious. The maid service was top notch.
5,Very nice hotel,"The location is great, few steps from 6th ave where all things happen. A lot of bars, restaurants and night life around the hotel. The room I got in historic section was roomy and nice.The lobby was nice, and the bar at 2nd level was very kool.I would highly suggest this place and I will come back again."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"WOW! Amazing. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here. The GM contacted me the day of check in to confirm our approximate time of arrival. When we checked in we were greeted by wonderful staff and had a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries in our room. The hotel itself is historic and mysterious. We loved the interaction we had with other staff and guest regarding its history, especially since we stayed on the 5th floor of the historic side which is said to be haunted. Note we saw no ghost, and my wife actively looked lol. We enjoyed the Driskills happy hour which was both reasonable and delicious. We enjoyed our anniversary dinner at the Driskill Grille. We told no one there it was our anniversary yet were greeted with happy anniversary greeting and dessert by the restaurant staff. Overall a wonderful experience. I would recommend to all. We will definitely be making this an annual occurence!"
5,Fantastic Stay!,"We just completed a fantastic stay at this property where we were well taken care of. Everyone was super accommodating and warm and friendly. Our daughters loved exploring this beautiful historic building and since we were visiting during the holidays, there were beautiful decorations. The location was perfect and parking was easy. We were about to find street parking when we needed it and everything else was easily walkable. We were in the deluxe room for part of the stay and then the Governers suite. Both rooms were unique and fun. This hotel staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and we loved every minute of it! Thank you to FD manager Luther for an amazing stay!"
4,The Driskill Holiday,"While not all Hyatts are the same in terms of hospitality and service, for example The Hyatt Lost Pines, this trip to the Driskill was very pleasant. The staff at the front desk, Sydney and Ryan in particular were very helpful."
4,A beautiful Historic hotel in wonderful condition,I stayed here 2 nights for a friend’s wedding and I found it to be very clean and quiet and comfortable. The beds are extremely comfy! The staff is friendly and helpful at all times. The food is wonderful. I would live here if I could! Lol. The only negative thing I have to say is that the only one type of parking and that is valet-only at a cost of $45/night. I understand the shortage of parking space in some res of Austin and grew to really appreciate the valet attendants abd their ability to keep move the cars in and out on a busy street. But I I think Hyatt Regency is charging too much to the point of gouging.So if you can get over the cost of parking everything else is great. The building is historic and is absolutely beautiful inside and out.
4,Beautiful lobby and common areas!,"This hotel has some beautiful Texas charm. Interesting history. I visited the bar on a Wednesday night. There was fun live music and a good crowd, but not crowded. My only disappointment was some of the bathroom fixtures weren't quite right. There was low water pressure, and the tub stopper kept falling down when I was showering. Other than that, the room was quiet, warm, clean, and comfortable."
4,Our favorite hotel in Austin,"I have been an occasional guest for nearly 30 years, which includes a tolerating a major renovation, change of ownership and some enjoyable evenings in the bar and restaurant. We love this beautiful historic hotel. The New Year’s Eve dinner was exceptional. Our only complaint (actually my wife’s) was the bed sheets: Synthetic. Uncomfortable and felt cheap."
4,Christmas at the Driskill,We stayed at The Driskill while visiting family for Christmas. The hotel is stunning decorated for the holidays and provided lots of pretty backdrops for photos. The bar is an ideal place to hang out as a group or watch a football game. The stocking left on our door and the carriage rides out front made this trip special! The only negative is that the King room was small.
2,Anniversary stay,"Came down here for our anniversary. The place looked pretty neat and historic. It was all of that. But, it fell way short when it came to our room. The noisiest place I think I’ve ever stayed. The noise machine next to the bed should have been our sign. The bathroom and closet doors would not close without slamming or pulling excessively. It felt like the other guest were in our room. A intermittent buzzing never stopped and would keep us awake. Bed and pillows are outdated along with the shower and bathroom. Stay at a Hilton !"
1,Out of the darkness,"Although I booked the room several months in advance, on arrival I was allocated the only available room which was an internal room with no natural daylight. This was like sleeping in a mausoleum. Poor!"
5,Great choice in Austin,"We love the Driskill, and always stay there when we’re in Austin. It offers a real Texas experience, as it is downtown, near the capitol and historic Congress Street, and UT. There are great restaurants nearby, or a short drive from the hotel. The public spaces are beautiful, historic, well-maintained, and lively. The rooms are in good shape and the staff is friendly and expert."
5,Very elegant Texas hotel,"Loved staying here, the room was very nice and spacious. The staff was great from the time we checked in. The café was very good and the bakery is excellent. The valets were all very courteous and friendly. We would definitely stay here in we are ever in Austin again."
5,Beautiful Hotel,We only got to stay for the one night but it was lovely. Friendly staff - easy valet service ($45). The room was beautiful and clean. Wish we could had stayed another night and tried the bar down stairs which was super busy!! Will stay again when we’re in Austin again. :)
5,Awesome!,"A perfect location and gorgeous hotel!!! We definitely enjoyed our stay. Great restaurant, bar and and nightly entertainment. Our room was comfortable and clean. The staff was very friendly and informative. A must if staying in Austin....."
5,Excellence,This is as 5 star as 5 star gets. Very unique and unbelievable service. Location is very special as well as the architecture. The food is tremendous and Concierge serve is also 5 Star and a tremendous resource.
4,Christmas at The Driskill,"The entire hotel was decorated beautiful for Christmas. I officiated a wedding on the Mezzanine level, it was so pretty. The first night we stayed in a standard room. The room was a bit musty, we had an infant who had coughing issues and I kept sneezing. Not sure it was due to the room, but it seemed to make things worse. The second night we moved to a suite on the Mezzanine level. It was incredible. No musty smell, high ceilings, great view of 6th street (if you're into that kind of thing... it was definitely fun people watching), awesome bathroom. It is definitely an old hotel, so many of the standard rooms are smaller, but the feeling of the hotel is totally worth it and you are right on 6th street and minutes away from the river. I would definitely go back. Check out the bar, and there is great breakfast options all around the hotel - from Voodoo Donuts to 1886 Bakery. Finally, the hospitality was incredible. The staff took wonderful care of all of us who were there for the wedding. They were quite accommodating and so friendly."
5,Nice hotel with classic paintings and and art work. Located on six street.,Very nice hotel with paintings and art work. Placated on six street. Great to return to the room after visiting Austin’s famous six street. Look forward coming back. Staff was very friendly. Rooms are unique. Have to keep typing to reach 200 character limit....lol
2,Customer service poor,The representatives at this hotel do not understand customer service. They are rude and would consider staying at the Omni instead. The doors don’t close in the bathrooms either. If your booking here don’t be afraid of old not so clean rooms.
5,Elegant and Refined!,"The history of this beautiful property is very interesting, and the architecture of the hotel recalls an era of a lovely time! The hotel is immaculate and the staff welcoming and very professional. The 1886 offers a fabulous breakfast and afternoon tea. (Check with the hotel for the dates regarding tea.)"
4,Beautiful hotel,"Great hotel with a very friendly staff. Our room was in the tower, which meant walking through private parties to get to our elevator which was very uncomfortable and unusual. The location is awesome and room service was delicious though."
4,Always a great choice,"Great hotel in the heart of Austin! Walking distance to just about everything! Driskill is always a great choice! Great restaurant, bar, customer service. Overnight valet is bit high, but, oh well. Easy and convenient to so many things in the downtown area of Austin"
5,Driskell Hotel,"The hotel itself is wonderful. Sadly the 6th Street area in Austin is overrun by bums, panhandlers, and beggars. Several dozen were readily apparent, and the area no longer feels safe, at least to us. I recommend the hotel highly, but stay off of 6th Street unless you like being constantly bugged by panhandlers"
4,"Go for location, hang at the bar",This old classic in the middle of Austin’s scene is the definition of Texas stately elegance. At the junction of 6th a stroll in any direction finds good food and great music. Do not leave without spending time at the longhorn themed bar.
4,Nice historic olace,This hotel is located in downtown Austin parking is by valet only in side of hotel .The staff is friendly rooms nice Forth floor smells of but I think the place is over 100 so doubt that can be fixed . The fitness center has technogym.
5,Beautiful Historic Hotel in downtown Austin,"If you would like to step back in time and enjoy the beautiful architecture of a grand hotel, you will not be disappointed. Christmas season is a wonderful time to visit and enjoy the beautifully decorated lobby. Many venues in downtown Austin are close by as well."
2,It is not worth the price . . .,"We picked The Driskill because of its reputation for being a “traditional and classic” hotel and accepted its daily high rate. The hotel’s interior is classic and traditional, but unfortunately, the atmosphere was far from it. There were numerous parties at various locations within the hotel, which made the place noisy and crowded. On one occasion, we needed to walk through the food serving area, for an event, to get to the elevator to our room. The experience fell way below our expectations, and we will not stay at the Driskill again. After paying over $350 per night, we were charged $45 per night for the parking, and $6 per bottle of water in the room . . . unbelievable!!! Our room didn’t get cleaned till past 3 PM, even after calling twice to get it cleaned. Another issue with our room was the 24 hr a day sound of an elevator. Our room was two doors away from what appeared to be a service elevator. With all the events going on in the hotel, the elevator was constantly being used; especially on Saturday night. I feel we could have stayed a much better place in downtown Austin for $400 per night (including parking)."
1,1886 Bakery,"Every Christmas for the past 10 years we have gone to the 1886 Bakery with our family and friends for a special treat for Christmas to have lunch. Last year we had the same waiter, Greg. He was not very personable but we thought ""oh well he's having a bad day"". So this year 2018 we just came from there. Guess what, same waiter, Greg. We asked for extra water in a pitcher as the glasses are extremely small. He rolled his eyes and brought us our pitcher. After that we did not see him again. We had the food manager Mitch as our waiter. He was very personable and took our order. We are all over 65 so we always spit a plate. We were hoping for the fried chicken that they have been famous for forever. Well they did not have it but it was shown on their website menu. A little disappointing but no big deal. We could all tell when we ordered they did not like we were splitting a meal and kept asking if we wanted anything else or something to drink. Very intimidating. At the end of the meal Mitch came back over to talk to us. He is very nice but we all knew what he was referencing his conversation to our splitting a plate. He asked us if we were having a big dinner planned this evening since we shared a plate today. We told him ""we always share a plate and once you are our age you will too and understand"". Needless to say it really put a downer on our festive yearly occasion. We were planning as usual to take our whole family of 13 there for Christmas eve but have decided to go elsewhere. I truly hope this review helps the management to explain to their employees that a condescending attitude is not productive to a well managed establishment.Thank you, Glenda and Greg"
5,Very nice classic hotel,We kind of hate the newer trendy modern hotels that are frankly quite stark and look all the same to my wife and I. The Driskill was very nice and the rooms had old school character but with modern features. I would certainly stay there again.
3,Good location / good breakfast,"The hotel is historic, and it is in a location central to many things.The room and bath were good. However, windows don’t give much of a view in many of the rooms. Some windows are frosted for privacy, due to proximity of other rooms/windows. Also, it was a holiday season visit, so I cannot discern whether hotel is typically more peaceful/quiet.Breakfast in the 1886 Cafe was very good, with my choice being their personal style of eggs Benedict (croissant-based)."
5,Unique Experience,The Driskill is a charming and old world hotel that has been updated. The room was beautifully appointed. The bar area is like having a drink in someone's living room. The food was excellent. And the staff were friendly and helpful.
1,AVOID THE VALET SERVICE AT THE DRISKILL,"This review pertains only to the valet parking service.I left my car with the valet for an hour or so. Upon its return to me, the vehicle smelled like a New Orleans bar. It was either smoked in or was driven by someone whose clothes were completely saturated in smoke. After driving with the windows down for a half-hour, it still smells like a campfire. Perhaps the job market has gotten so tight in Austin that they're using hobos as drivers. I called and reported the situation, and the hotel folks apologized, but there really nothing to be done but to avoid using them in the future."
5,A splendid hotel.,"My husband and I spent three nights at the Driskill, and it was lovely. The lobby is beautiful, the staff superb, and breakfast at 1886 was delicious every day...the best Eggs Benedict! Restaurants recommended by the Concierge did not disappoint. We would definitely stay here again."
3,Our experience at the driskill,Nice hotel but kind of tired. Great service and food. 100% polyester bed linens hot and big disappointment for a hotel that is a advertised as a 4.5 star. Pillows awful too. Great bar with super music every night.
5,Great accommodation for 6th street nightlife,"Hotel history and excellent restoration is reason enough to book a room. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Rooms are uniquely restored and furnishings add to the authenticity and yet modern in function. Nice to have a bath tub. Room was quiet from outside and inside noise. Coffee in room, complimentary Wi-Fi. Room attendants are excellent and attention to detail did not go unnoticed, room was very clean. Hotel has small hotel vibe in hotel guest access areas. The bar is a lot of fun and seems to be a local hangout. Live music on Friday night was very good. Bar service was very attentive. David the valet is knowledgeable with history of hotel and gave us a quick tour of hotel. Hotel really should offer David’s tour as a choice for guest. We heard him giving a tour to another couple and tagged along, we were so glad we did."
5,Fun at the Driskill,We had a lovely visit at the Driskill this fall. We were visiting family and it was the perfect location for us. Everyone was wonderful. We has a room on the 12th floor and it was very pretty and spacious. We loved having a cocktail in the bar before going out to dinner. We also enjoyed the Café downstairs for coffee and breakfast.
5,So Charming! True Texas Experience!,"Don't stay at cookie cutter hotels in Austin, stay at The Driskill! What a stunning, majestic, historic hotel! We only had one night in Austin on our way to a family wedding, but we made the most of it by staying here! As soon as we walked through the doors into the grand entryway, we knew we'd made the right decision!Before arrival, we were greeted via email by Danielle Rivetti, Guest Experience Manager. She provided us many helpful recommendations and put my mind at ease regarding a few concerns I had about water and weather conditions! She even texted us the day of arrival to wish us safe travels, ensure our room was ready upon arrival, and even offered herself as on-call, should we need anything else during our stay! When we arrived to our room, we were touched and pleasantly surprised by a hand-written card from Danielle, as well as some extra bottled water and delicious Pecan Sandy Cookies! It was such a sweet surprise!Our room was on the 4th floor, which is supposedly haunted! The vintage looking halls are filled with beautiful oil paintings in golden frames, and does feel a bit spooky, but overall, we felt nothing but good vibes here! Although our room was a bit small, the tall ceiling and large window totally made up for it! We also had an awesome view of 6th street, which made for great people-watching at night!The hotel and room decor screams Texas and was the perfect mix of old and new. I often worry that a vintage rooms equate to small, old and dingy, but this was definitely not the case at The Driskill! The vintage details of the room are so charming, but it also felt clean and modern, due to the comfy Hyatt bed, and other newer furnishings and carpet. The vintage bathroom was also beautifully appointed, while still have a very large, modern sized shower, with great water pressure.We enjoyed the ambience in the 1886 Cafe and live music in The Driskill Bar. I didn't get to experience breakfast in the cafe, but definitely aim to next time! We did get coffee here, and my husband got one of their huge cinnamon rolls! (Both were just okay).We only had one night to experience Austin BBQ, so we wanted to enjoy Happy Hour drinks and bites at The Driskill Bar, and still be able to go out for a nice dinner. We were very disappointed to discover they had canceled Happy Hour due to a Film Festival in the area, which seemed to bring in a large crowd. This seemed like price-gouging to us, and was frankly, tacky and unfair to hotel guests. We had no idea there would even be a film festival when we originally booked our trip. We were really bummed that we didn't get to sample anything here or earn points, using our Hyatt Card!Other than the Happy Hour debacle, we had an excellent time at this unique and beautiful hotel! If I'm being really nit-picky, the perfume smell in the lobby is a tad overbearing, but this is a problem I find at many hotels. Every staff member we interacted with was very caring and the customer service provided by Danielle Rivetti went above and beyond! We definitely can't wait to return to The Driskill and explore Austin further!"
5,The staff is very courteous and you feel very connected to the local culture,The staff is very courteous and you feel very connected to the local culture. The location is near all the attraction in the downtown area. Centrally located to all the hot spots in downtown Austin. Rooms are clean and the food in their restaurants and cafe are very well prepare and tasty. I recommend this hotel for anyone who likes to experience the culture and history of Austin.
3,Weekend trip,"Good news: Great location. Historic building well maintained. Front desk staff very nice. Valet staff friendly. Bad news: understaffed in very busy bar. Hotel cafe may be good, but the wait times were long (over 30 minutes for breakfast the whole time we were there), and service was not friendly. $45 a night for parking. Take note! Three weddings booked that weekend. Whole place was understaffed. I was disappointed in service. The hotel should have planned better."
4,"Great Location, Great Food","Perfect location for walking to several downtown venues - 6th Ave clubs, capitol, Congress bridge for bat viewing. The food in both the breakfast cafe and dinner restaurant is outstanding. The bar is very lively with grest food as well. Bar staff is a bit overwhelmed though and a little slow. Good live entertainment."
5,Amazing Experience,"The Driskill Hotel is not just a place to stay, but an exciting experience! The building is gorgeous building with lots of history. It is well-located in the city. The service was great and the Driskill Bar was fun with good music."
5,"Great stay, wish we could have stayed longer","This hotel is fantastic. Daniela with guest services reached out several days prior to my arrival. She made sure as Globalists we had an exceptional room that fit our needs.Everything was ready upon arrival. The check-in process was prompt. We had a spacious room in the historic wing. The view wasn’t the greatest, but I didn’t mind as the window treatments were more romantic and whimsical when they were partially closed. It was very quiet with almost no street noise. The bathroom doors were quiet small, but the shower was large as was the jetted tub. We always had enough piping hot water for baths and showers. The tub has a vintage shower head on it which is lovely. We only stayed one night, but I took 4 baths. That’s how fantastic the tub was. The robes were very soft and incredibly large. The only missing part were slippers. The bed was surprisingly comfortable as it looked a little weak, and the room temperature was great.We had a minor issue with the hostess in the restaurant, but that was immediately rectified by management. They went above and very far beyond to make sure we were pleased with the rest of our stay.The lobby is ornate with vintage touches and incredibly high ceilings. Upstairs there is a gorgeous bar/lounge area with couches. The walls are solid wood giving it a very old school Texas charm. Look up the history on the hotel. Very interesting. A little spooky, but interesting none the less.As Globalists the valet is free along with complimentary water in the room, late check-out, and breakfast at the cafe. The service and food at the cafe was lacking, but then again we were there during Sunday brunch so it was very busy.The ONLY down side to this hotel is the elevator. There’s not much they can do really, but they are so old and very, very questionable. I was riddled with anxiety every time I stepped on.I would love to come back and explore the area again. This was one of my favorite hotel stays to date. The Driskill really meets and exceeds what I expect from a Hyatt brand hotel. Well done."
5,Great vintage bar — don’t miss it.,"You can’t help but love the setting, drinks and happy hour food. Brussel sprouts, homemade jerky and a great bourbon selection!Spotty service initially on a Sunday night but Manager Mandy made it right.And the hotel lobby — wow!"
5,Classic Texas Style,"Ideally located in the middle of the downtown close to many restaurants and the Capitol. Excellent venue for business conferences. Love the floral fragrance in the lobby. The beds were well up beautifully in crisp, white linen. I was thankful for the complimentary toothpaste. I always seem to forget to pack it."
5,Fabulous Texas History,Large lobby was amazing with its art deco décor and large pillars (reminded me of mosques in Spain). Staff was friendly and proud to share the history of the hotel. Concierge was invaluable in finding restaurants and places to hear live music. Room was comfortable. Enjoyed breakfast at the beautiful 1866 café.
5,Beautiful historic hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Couple of blocks from the Tx State Capitol which is a must see. Staff and accommodations were exceptional. Must eat in the historic bar and have breakfast at the cafe, their coffee is to die for!"
3,Central location,"We chose this hotel coz it’s centrally locates. Especially it’s near the State Capitol building. It’s also a short walk to the Lady Bird lake. Hotel itself is historic. The lobby has that old place grandeur! Love the hardwood and paintings all over the hallway and lobby. It was crowded when we were there because there was a film fest going on. There’s no driveway or anything, so you have to unload on the side of the street. There’s valet parking or you can park in garage across the street. We have a 1 queen bed room, more like a double bed than a queen. Room is smaller than regular hotel room. bathroom is small too. Bathroom needs updating. There’s a cafe/restaurant in the hotel, but you’re in downtown so you have a lot of restaurant choices. There’s no pool. Not sure about a fitness center. Staff are friendly. Paid $300 plus tax for the room, which I think is a bit pricey compared to other hotels for same price with more modern facilities and bigger room. You’re paying for the history of the place more than anything else! But if you’re a history buff it’s worth it! And I don’t mind it! You don’t always get to stay at a historic place like this!"
4,Historic Hotel with a very cool bar lounge,"Our group recently booked the Driskill for our football trek to the UT game. We are basically snobs from California and we took over the lounge bar at night. The staff, bartenders, and drinks were awesome. The rooms are clean, updated, and the ambiance is ""old Texas traditional."" I could not give it 5 stars because there is a serious homeless problem in and around the streets of Austin. All of the hotels have to deal with this, but I would say that the Driskill is still the best location. You can walk to 6th street and the river paths easily."
5,Texas at the Driskill,"Texas history on display at the Driskill, step off the grounds at your own risk (of course) but with the added scooters & bicyclists on sidewalks danger, panhandling bums, homeless, drug/alcoholic ""diversity"", but worth it IMO for the live Blues & street musicians."
5,Welcome to Austin,The Driskill is a very well maintained Austin icon. Beautiful to look at and in the midst of downtown you can enjoy a long weekend of restaurants and sight seeing by walking or utilizing the new scooter system. Our king room was large with high ceilings and a ceiling fan for adjustable comfort.
4,"Beautiful, historic hotel combined with a great location","Took a quick business trip to Austin. Stayed two nights at the Driskell a Hyatt Unbound property. The hotel definitely has history. The lobby and bar area are beautiful with plenty of detail. The hallways are full of art and charm.I was given a corner room that had plenty of windows. Unfortunately I was on the 4th floor with no view. I did not eat or have a drink at the hotel but it seemed like a happening spot.The gym was small with only a few weight machines and a free weight dumbell rack from 5lbs to 50. There were a few cardio machines as well. Luckily it wasn’t busy but it would definitely get tight with 5 or more people in it.The location was superb, close to businesses and tons of bars and restaurants. It’s definitely a different feel from the new modern glass and steel high rise hotels going up around it.Couple small notes:I communicated to the front desk that I was missing a privacy door tag and did not need housekeeping since I was only there for a day and a half. I came back and two staff were in the room cleaning. Second I was there during the water boil issue and no large bottles of water were provided in the room and no water was available in the gym. Very minor issues but still worth noting.Overall I would recommend this hotel to travelers."
5,Breathtaking Glimpse Into History,"If you love history, you MUST make time to visit here! The 1880's architecture, alone, is worth the visit, but once you step inside, you'll realize this fully-functioning hotel is a museum in itself! From the bar lamps made from real boot spurs and 1880's pistols to the memorabilia from LBJ's election watches and private suite (which you can actually stay in!), this hotel offers visitors a glimpse into the past. While we were waiting for our table in the 1886 Cafe & Bakery, we strolled around the hotel and took in everything we could, but this beautiful venue deserved a second look so we came back again!"
4,Great location in downtown Austin,"The Driskill is one of those classic, historical hotels that you must stay in at least once. The lobby and bar are beautiful, the staff are friendly, and there are some good rates to be had, depending on when you book."
4,Historic gem,"No visit to Austin would be complete without a visit to The Driskill. Be prepared to step back in time and enjoy a taste of old fashioned luxury. The decor is amazing and the 1886 cafe serves wonderful food. Sadly there was no live music playing on the Sunday lunchtime we visited, but it was worth it nevertheless. The bar at the back of the hotel featured in Miss Congeniality!"
3,"The Good, Bad and Ugly","In my previous trips to Austin, I passed by this hotel and admired the architecture, finally I stayed there this weekend with mixed results. Every staff interaction was really pleasant and professional, I loved the furnishings in the lobby, but could not get over the 'musty smell' not sure if this was a result of the recent rains and general dampness of Austin (on this weekend). The very slow elevator finally reached my floor and when I opened the door to my room, I was immediately hit with the strongest bleach like smell. I later confirm that the housekeeping team was using Clorox to clean the room. It took both the overhead and bathroom fans to cleanse the air. This was a major distraction from the quaintness of the room. The other major distraction was the loud music that was generated by a private event. I would not book this hotel again."
5,Driskill Hotel in Austin,Had an excellent visit at the Driskill. Customer service was exceptional and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The location is excellent for hitting the nightspots on 6th street. The valet service was great also.
3,A night away for a 78704 couple,"Beautiful, old hotel, with a few snafus along the way.Regular staff was off the night that we arrived, and while there were backup staff in place, they were completely clueless. So much so, that they had no idea where the elevators were to take up to our room.We asked for a king but were given a full, and after some back and forth upgraded to a king for additional cost. The king room was great. The full room was teeny tiny-NYC size.The bar is pretty fun, and worth having a drink at. Loved the cafe downstairs. Great that they respect the time period it was built in.Overall this is a decent hotel, and I would strongly recommend staying on a higher floor due to street noise. Would not stay here again, though."
5,The bar is straight out of a Wild West set,"A beautiful, historic building. A must visit if you are in Austin. The bar is iconic and pure Texas. We went for happy hour and had some of house cocktails . Service was great and lots of nice places to sit. Highly recommended"
5,Beautiful historic hotel with excellent service,"Everyone at went out of their way to make sure we were being taken care of, even staff just passing by ask if we needed anything. It does have it's quirks but is very well maintained for a property of this age. Can't wait to go back."
4,Elegant Old World Hotel,"The Driskill is an elegant, architecturally interesting hotel with a lively history. It is ideally located in downtown Austin. The staff are very helpful and friendly and they go out of their way to be accommodating. The food and beverage options on site are more than adequate if you must grab something at the hotel, or for meeting up with people."
5,Luxurious,Luxurious in every way. Best drinks ever in the sophisticated bar. We walked to ACL each day. There were many restaurants to chose from and easy to walk to. The lobby is so comfortable and a great place to meet others.
2,Poor service at the bar/lounge,"Normally don’t like to right a bad reviews but I hope they see this & talk to the staff in the lounge. We were told by our tour guide to stop in see the building (it is very beautiful) but he also said if you have lunch/drink the service is terrible. Well we stopped to have a drink, as we sat at the bar we noticed a male patron being very rude to the bartender. Asking for his food then the check several times & quite abruptly left saying he would come down later to straighten out the check as it was wrong. We then noticed the couple next to asking repeatedly for the check as well and were rudely responded to by the bar tender “ In a minute” . Now I would also like to note the bar was NOT FULL or even busy. We then decided to ask for our check to leave. We had to ask 3 different bar tenders for it! Finally receiving after quite some time (15 minutes) we now know why the fi st patron was so belligerent! Sad to have such poor service in such a beautiful place. As I said hoping the management sees this & makes some improvements."
5,Wonderful Wedding Weekend,"Stayed at the Driskill for a friend's wedding, it was a wonderful experience. This place is in the middle of everything! Very pleasant staff. Would definitely come back. Humidity inside hotel seemed slightly high during our visit, other than that, everything was awesome!"
5,Wedding at the Driskill,"The Driskill hotel is beautiful and historic, the decorations are all very ornate and add to the ambiance. The rooms are a little small but given that it’s such a historic hotel that is expected. The bar area is very fun, there is plenty of seating around the lobby and bar area. The room service was amazing! Best hotel room service we’ve ever had!"
4,Just a Visit for Lunch and Lobby,"Reviewer visited the lobby, but did not stay overnight at the hotel. If you only have time for a few things in Austin, this should be on your list. Magnificent lobby and lounge, with a 2nd floor balcony. Nearby garage parking was $9 per hour, capped at $30."
4,"Beautiful historic hotel with excellent location, food and service.","We stayed at The Driskill for 4 nights in September, 2018, in order to attend a wedding held in the venue. Public spaces are beautiful and worthy of many photos, though very noisy. Our room was in the ""historic"" side of the hotel and was a little noisy (hallway and street noise), but very comfortable, spacious and well-appointed. The breakfast at the hotel was outstanding; tried it the first morning and went back every day, even though there were cheaper restaurants a block or two away. Food at the wedding (and everything about the wedding reception) was outstanding. The hotel has a nice barroom on a mid level that often featured live music. The Driskill is adjacent to Austin's 6th Street Entertainment District -- which is good and bad, depending on your taste. It's a short walk to The Capitol, the 2nd Street district and the Congress Avenue Bridge (home of 1.5 million bats.)Warning: we had two bad experiences with YELLOW CABS. They are SCAM artists; Avoid them! Lyft, Uber, Green Cabs are ok. This is well-known in Austin, yet we were NOT warned by the hotel. Complained to the front desk and they could care less. This fact, the noise, and no free coffee in the lobby are three of the reasons this is a 4-star hotel and not 5."
5,Glitz and rock and roll.,"The Driskill is a Snazy place. Very Very high class, but still very cool. It is right there on 6th avenue so it is easy to get to the clubs/music Austin is famous for.It was my first time in Austin and I really went to check out the music scene, as such this hotel places you right in the middle of it.I did not take eat at any of the Hotel restaurants so I can not speak for that, but the Hotel was great, service was great. Music was great.A coffee shop in Hotel would be nice."
5,"Excellent Hotel in Austin, Texas","I stayed at the Driskill Hotel for 4 days attending a wedding. Wow was I impressed. Built in 1886. The rooms are large, comfortable bed, Excellent Service, the Bakery and Cafe off of the lobby serves the most delicious delicious food. Right in the middle of downtown - and close to everything. Everything is so close - we walked everywhere. It’s a fantastic place. The Grill and Bar was really a gathering place. The Happy hour is very popular. Lasty the Ballrooms and Meeting rooms were spacious. I could live there - I liked it so much.Oh, the State Capitol Building is a couple blocks up Congress Avenue - the same street where everything is.Wonderful Place - definitely 5 StarsI will be back"
5,Quick Get A Way,First class treatment at The Driskill. Valet park your car and enjoy the sights and sounds of downtown Austin. Be sure to top the night off at the Driskill lounge. Have a wonderful brunch in the hotel restaurant before you hit the road again. Beautiful historic hotel in the heart of downtown Austin.
5,Three Women in a room at the Driskill,"Three women in one room are usually falling all over themselves, but it was not our experience with this stay at The Driskill. Our lovely room accommodated two king beds, chairs and best of all a dressing room with double sink and a bathroom with a sink. We were very comfortable.The Driskill is not just a hotel in which to rest one's head on a pillow. It is a Texas destination. The artwork depicting events such as the hotel being the first intercontinental telephone exchange, western sculptures, and Texas decor are not to be missed. The atmosphere of the bar with live entertainment,is always contagious fun.The restoration maintained the ambiance of the original hotel while adding beautiful decor and modern conveniences."
3,"Beautiful old hotel, in need of a makeover...","There are a lot of neat things in this hotel, the bar is a standout (the best sliders!), but the historic qualities are not quite enough to make up for the fact that it's a bit too dumpy to be considered a top hotel. Rooms and bathrooms are small (as older hotels are), décor is somewhat nice, but the sheets are the worst (polyblend? slippery? weird...), service was spotty, some people were total stars, some were barely polite. Overall a fine choice in downtown Austin though."
5,Awesome Historical Hotel,"Stayed just one night at this gorgeous haunted hotel! The hotel itself is magnificent. Be sure to take a Ghost Tour from one of the local tour companies. When you make reservations, make sure you ask for the OLD section (1886). The hotel is very quirky and like a maze. Our one night stay was just over $600 which was very expensive for us. Food was excellent but be prepared to pay a bit more than other hotels. This hotel is in a very congested part of town and it is valet parking only. You can walk to restaurants as driving those congested streets is a nightmare. The rooms are large and comfortable. Bathrooms are old but clean. They kept the integrity of the period, though. It was an experience to stay one night, however, I would not stay again due to the price and location. But I am glad I was able to experience just once."
5,TribFest 2018,"What a grand hotel! If you want to feel old LBJ Texas ambiance and service then this is your place. Leave the stock hotel brands behind and soak up everything that is special from the rooms, bar and even exercise room is above and beyond. Enjoy"
5,Gorgeous Historical Comfort,"Room 422 in the historical side of the hotel was comfortable, beautiful, and quiet except for late nighters getting off the elevator. Friendly welcoming service from the front desk, valet, cafe, and banquet people. EVERY person was helpful and friendly for our 4 day stay! Food awesome in cafe and banquet area. outstanding stay at this hotel and we will return to this hotel for sure."
5,Classic and comfortable example of Texas hospitality!,"We were there for a wedding that was at the hotel. The entire weekend was magical. The wedding itself, Cocktails, sit-down dinner, dancing and then closing the bar down. We had an amazing time and slept so well on the comfortable beds. We were on the original side of hotel in vintage standard room which was very spacious! Loved it!"
1,So disappointing,"Here for a conference for a 4 day stay. Some staff but not all pleasant and obviously poorly trained in client service in every area we encountered them.Housekeeping ,bar and restaurant . Lobby has an overpowering smell of disinfectant/perfume . Level of mold in the AC vents is overwhelming ."
5,"Absolutely remarkable - if you want to take a trip back to the 1920's - 30's, you must visit this incredible hotel!","Absolutely remarkable - if you want to take a trip back to the 1920's - 30's, you must visit this incredible hotel! Not the ""same old - we value your business - hotel"" it's a destination in itself - AND they treat you like they actually appreciate your business."
5,Great anniversary experience!,"I've stayed at the Driskill several times, and it's always been a fabulous experience. For this anniversary trip, the staff went above and beyond with lots of little perks (chocolate strawberries and champagne! and more!) Thank you!"
5,Historic & charming with wonderful service,"We took our grandson to “Texas” for his 12th birthday and this was our 3rd place and stop.I called the concierge , Amanda, several times before the visit , asking for suggestions and help with booking tours. She was fantastic both before and during our visit!!The suite was small but we loved the charm of the hotel. We ate at the bar area a couple of times because it was easier & we were tired and could play cards there. Great prices for food and drinks for happy hour.When we arrived, Amanda’s fellow concierge talked with Max about 10 minutes about sports. It was something he remembers. Amanda had a small birthday cake sent to the room after he arrived which was very thoughtful.Max loved the haunted part of the hotel.Our travel agent arranged this bundle with the air. Breakfast was included. It was always busy.It was about a 6 block walk from the hotel to the river to see the bats.We would absolutely stay here again if we are in Austin.Sorry this has taken me so long.Thanks, Amanda and your team, for helping to make Max’s birthday special!"
3,"Hotel is Grand, service is not.",The Driskill is a great hotel in a great location with a great history. It has undiciplined children running bell services and makes you feel like you are not really welcome the moment that you arrive. The original rooms are a kick (12 foot ceilings) and the Food and Beverage was absolutely outstanding.
5,Grandiose historical Hotel. Scrumptious dining.,"We spent 4 days at the Driskill. The lobby’s architecture is opulent and our room was large, extremely comfortable and well appointed. Our children asked us to take them to every floor so they could look at the displayed artwork and antique shadow boxes.Upon arrival, we were not aware that the Driskill is a historical treasure trove. Our room had brief overview of The Driskill’s beginnings and we immediately started researching it’s fascinating and slightly spooky past. A short walk took us to the Texas Capitol building which we all enjoyed. It was four days of family fun, fabulous food, fascinating history and resplendent surroundings. The Driskill is on our “must return” list!"
5,We honeymooned here,"We lived in Austin and decided to get married before we had to move back to California for business. I have always loved the architecture of this historic landmark so we were extremely excited to take in what the hotel had to offer. We were not disappointed at all, the staff was very friendly and eager to help. The hotel has so much history and beautiful art work that you could spend days taking it all in. We really got to enjoy the 6th street experience and felt very safe walking the streets at night. We did not get to eat at the restaurant but the menu look very inviting and will do that on our next visit. We did spend some time at the bar and listening to music in the lounge, which I highly suggest."
5,Beautiful historical hotel in the middle of the City of Austin,This was the main hotel for the guests for a wedding. Also had the fabulous Wedding Sunday Brunch there. It was fabulous. Out-of-town guests from LA & NY loved the Hotel!!!! They loved the Driskill Bar after the Reception!
1,Look elsewhere,Not worth the time and money. Rooms weren’t very functional and their services are far from what you’d expect at a nicer hotel. I would never come back to this hotel. Just as many nice hotels in the same area and for a fraction of the cost that are nicer and offer better services.
5,Superb location and hotel,Stay in the historic part!!! How did I miss that this hotel is haunted?? Love that. The room was charming and very nice. The hotel itself is extremely cool and the customer service is beyond excellent. Also love the bar!!
5,Very beautiful hotel! y clean!,Very beautiful hotel. Rooms are clean & comfy! Staff is very professional! Great location ! Lobby area is amazing with the beautiful artwork! Bar area is nice ! Will recommend to family & friends ! Enjoyed our stay !!!
4,Iconic Hotel in the Heart of Austin near 6th street,"This is an iconic, historic hotel with a location that cannot be beat for proximity to 6th street. This Driskill Grill and Cafe Bakery are very good. Also enjoyed the upstairs bar when looking for something more low key than 6th street bars.Rooms are variable. My original room was very small, on the side of the hotel that wasnt recently renovated- the room was cramped with mediocre views. Hotel upgraded me to a much bigger and updated room for a very small charge. It was worth it for this room upgrade.This is a historic building in every way, one cannot expect an new modern space but this hotel is iconic and elegant."
5,Driskill,I took my 13yr old daughter and two of her friends to the hotel for the experience of staying in a hotel that is supposedly haunted. The staff was very accommodating in making their ghosts hunting experience amazing. They were very sweet and funny about it. The food was amazing.
5,Perfection is in the details..,"From the marble-and-granite lobby, through the art-covered walls, and culminating in the lovely bedroom.. totally perfect! The room was spacious,and well lighted; the 2 queen-size beds were comfy—- but the bathroom!!! Separate rooms for sink, bath, toilet; wonderful toiletries, fluffy towels, and period perfect details (tile, faucets, etc)..."
5,Not to be missef,"A great place to stay if you value good location, but quiet rooms, elegant surroundings and a historical pedigree. The rooms are not large, but very adequate and the ceilings are very high, giving a feeling of spaciousness. It is right on a noisy section of Sixth St, but noise was never a problem. Excellent breakfast as well. Only negatives: no pool, parking and more outlets would have been nice, but those are common among historical hotels. There is valet parking (we passed at $48/night) and parked across the street at the Bank of America building which is $30/day weekdays and $10/day weekends. I just really loved the ambiance and the location was so terrific, we walked to everything. Highly recommend."
5,A fun experience,"I was in Austin for a family event. I had visited the Driskill for drinks in the past. However, this time I decided to stay there.I was given a room in the old section of the hotel and told that that part of the building was haunted. Sadly, I had no experience with any spirits.The staff was first rate and always helpful, sharing stories about its history and the people who had visited. The room was unique and the food was good.If I need to travel to Austin, the Driskill will be my go to place."
4,Wow!,"This hotel is fabulous it is a vacation in its self. Don’t even need to leave the hotel. The hotel is decorated to showcase its long history in Austin. Beautiful lobby, bar, restaurants, rooms, even the hallways are stunning. The 1886 cafe is delightful with excellent atmosphere and service. The menu is unique with lots of options. I had the cheese soup with a kale salad which were superb. The ice tea is also delicious. We had happy hour at the bar which is also decorated to enhance the image of the hotel. Excellent service and cocktails with affordable prices. The rooms were a little small and ours never really got cool enough. Housekeeping did not replenish toiletries. We stayed on the older side but rooms were nicely remodeled and we had a good street view. I must also caution about the downtown area. It has been two years since we have stayed downtown and it has gone downhill tremendously. Homeless, pan handlers and small gangs of young men hanging out on the streets harassing people especially women as they walk by. I saw no security or police but hotel staff says they do patrol the area. Downtown seemed dirty with many more closed businesses than what I remember. Please Austin, we used to enjoy your beautiful city. You can do better!"
5,The best hotel in Austin,"If you like history elegance & service, look no further. This one beats the 4 Seasons. I have stayed at both many times and I have make the Driskill my home-away-from-home when I'm in Austin. It's an easy walk to the convention center and most areas downtown."
5,Birthday fun,My daughter and I walked in looking horrible from wakeboarding all day and was treated very well! Lost our phone charger and housekeeping brought one up very quickly. We ordered room service and after 20 minutes they realized they were out of chicken tenders and offered to comp anything else we ordered. It was a great stay!
5,One of the best US hotels,"Stay Report - 8/21 - 8/22Location: The hotel is great if you enjoy downtown Austin.  It's on the corner of 6th and Brazos which puts it right next to the famous 6th Street.  The number of bars and restaurants (all kinds ranging from fancy food to sports bars, dueling piano bars etc.) you can walk to is staggering.  It's about 20-25 minutes from AUS and an easy drive (or walk if it isn't too hot) to Rainey Street or other parts of Austin.Hotel: The hotel is one of the most gorgeous I've been to in the United States.  The historic nature of the original structure is well preserved.  There's a huge lobby with a cowboy themed bar and restaurant just off it.  Every floor has bookshelves and books and artwork in the hallways.  Parking is limited to valet ($45 a night) but the valet drivers are really good.  There is very little Hyatt branding, it's limited to pretty much a small sign by the entrance which I think is fitting of an Unbound.Check In: The agent was very friendly and we were able to get into our room at 1:30.  We were thanked for our low tier (Discoverist?) status and offered a 2 PM late check out and free enhanced wifi.Room: A little on the small side but still quite nice.  There was a small desk, two comfortable beds, USB outlets next to the bed (no normal sized ones), a TV, small mini bar and larger than expected bathroom with two sinks.  Service was very prompt, both with my laundry (prices were very reasonable too).  The hotel also found out it was my brother's birthday and they brought him two beers and a slice of cake.The hotel is a little on the expensive side but it's really nice.  I'd gladly come back because it's frankly one of the best stays I've had in the US."
5,Beautiful hotel in the middle of the city,"First time visit to Austin, and couldn't have picked a better place - 6th Street is the place to be, especially on weekends. Walking distance to lots of great restaurants, as well as the UT campus & Capitol.We had a room near the NE corner, a great location to be away from the noise of 6th Street.Do your homework on parking - pretty expensive if you valet at the hotel ($45/night + tax if I recall)...we caught a break by parking at the Bank of America building across the street - $30 on a Friday night, but $10 per night Saturday and Sunday, into Monday morning."
5,The Best in Austin!,"Getting to stay in the best place in Austin was great. Every aspect of the experience was immaculate. The hotel was grand, the room was excellent and the amenities were great. Treated like a King!! I definitely will be staying here anytime I come to Austin, Texas!!"
5,Unique hotel in a great location,"The hotel was historic and a fun place to unwind.Good bar in the hotel. It is close to Congress Bridge to see the bats fly at night. The location is perfect to have fun on 6th street for people watching, places to eat and listen to many bands."
5,Amazing Hotel,"The Driskill is amazing, from the incredible decor to the friendly staff. We loved our room, and we loved loved loved the bar, and you can't beat the location. We will definitely stay here again when we're back!"
4,Loved the history and character of the whole place and the character,"It is a very old hotel, full of character and one can only imagine the stories. Rooms are comfortable, updated and clean but a little small. Valet parking was fast and easy and personnel very attentive."
5,Wonderful hotel with plenty to do,"The Driskill hotel was great. If you like historic looking hotels, pick this one. Lobby area and the rooms are great. Check in, valets, maids, everyone was great. We ate at the cafe a few times. Really good food. They made my son a waffle the shape of Texas. Never had dinner at the hotel, so I cannot comment. They had a band in the bar every night. Plenty to do within walking distance, 6th street, the Capital, watching bats, restaurants, local shops. Highly recommend the Driskill, great hotel, great price, great location. Thank you."
5,Really took good care of us,"Lovely hotel! We were supposed to book a two night stay for my wife's graduation from college. From the beginning, Luther made our stay special by sending a gift to our room for our special occasion! By our own mistake, we only booked one night and the rooms were sold out. Again the hotel staff went above and beyond to help us out. We had to move to another room, but to our surpruse it was an upgrade, at no extra charge. They went the extra mile to make us feel welcome. Thank You!"
4,Vehicle Damaged but Hotel is Amazing,"The hotel was extremely nice, room was very clean. The one issue I have is our vehicle was damaged by the valet and 1 week later we have still yet to hear from the adjuster The valet manager, Jordan was extremely helpful in explaining the process and assisting starting the claim process. Its the follow up and actually taking care of the damage that seems to be the problem I know The Driskill has a better reputation for customer service than this.In spite of this issue, I would still recommend this hotel to friends and family, as it is an amazing property overall."
5,"Historic, Elegant and Luxurious","If for no other reason, stop into the Driskill Hotel to see the enormous and breathtaking lobby with its gorgeous columms, gorgeous staircase and the huge portrait of Col. Driskill himself. Luxury and comfort are the themes at the hotel and the bar on the 2nd floor is to die for. Sundays the bar offers a Blues Brunch that's well priced and features a Blues Band too. Rooms are finely decorated and bedding is rich and silky. Take the plunge. It's worth every penny to spend the night here."
4,Great Property,Really liked this hotel and it’s location. The rooms are unique and seem to constantly be tended to as well upgraded from time to time. The hotel has a historic bar as well and on the floors a little library if you want to read something.
5,A dip into the past,"Walk into the Driskill and you walk into a glorious past, not to be found in most hotels: chandeliers, dozens of paintings on each floor, lovely woodwork. All with every modern convenience, excellent places to eat, including the fine bar. And all right in the middle of Austin. Our room was not large, but it had a huge, very comfortable bed, a comfy small couch, excellent wi-fi--and great quiet. And sufficient light to read. Ask the valet people for driving instructions (they're mainly local and know how to avoid the tons of construction). And do get out to the Fonda San Miguel, a really extraordinary Mexican restaurant well known to People in Austin."
4,TEA with granddaughter,"We had a lovely afternoon tea with our granddaughter in the Driskill. This is a beautiful hotel. We did not stay there as it was out of our price range, but what an iconic facility in the heart of Austin."
3,Business trip,"Pretty, well located hotel that does not cater to business travelers. Service is average at best. I passed several bellmen with a heavy bag and no one volunteered to help. Coffee is not available until 6:30 am. Lines are very long in the hotel food service locations due to understaffing."
5,Went for breakfast twice and apps at the bar - outstanding!,"We had three meals here and will definitely return when we come back to Austin. It's a must-see hotel, it's beautiful and every staff member was warm and friendly. We had breakfast twice in the cafe and decided to return for drinks and a light dinner in the bar - everything was delicious. Can't wait to visit again!"
5,Quaint yet modern and full of history,"The staff was very friendly and helpful, and I never had to search for someone to help me. My key got deactivated by my cellphone one night and security came up to help me within minutes. I loved the room, because although it had been updated, it retained the original floor plan and wood work. Very cool."
5,Family visit,"Went on repeat trip to the Driskill to meet family who were in town from New Yorkl We had not stayed in the Cattle Baron's Suite and decided to try it, mostly for the ambiance and history of the establishment. The Cattle Baron's Suite was everything we expected and more. It was truly outstanding, and perfect for a family reunion. We did multiple room service orders and the food was excellent. We will definitely visit again."
5,Beautiful historic hotel,Beautiful piece of local history . Amazing staff who could not do more for you . Very comfortable room and bed. Breakfast was very tasty in the bakery cafe. Loved sitting in the bar cocktails were amazing . Parking is expensive but seems the same all over Austin
3,Great hotel but...,"We were 2 couples 65-70 years old that visited Austin from June 29-July 2. I did the booking of this hotel online and I also called regarding the type of room. We had reserved the Petite Queen room since it was a little less money. When I called to find out the difference between the Petite and the regular queen room I was told that the overall size would be smaller. That being said, we got to our room around 11pm, after flying a few hours, it looked nice and we went to sleep. In the morning we realized that the bathroom was so tiny you could barely turn around, the shower cabinet was on an angle and could not accommodate any large/tall person. It was so tiny that there was only a pedestal sink and a commode. The hotel used the window sill to hold the toiletries! Also, there was only a mirror over the sink in the bathroom and high up on the wall over the bed was a small decorative one. Every morning my sister in law and I would check each other out to make sure we were dressed ok! We did tell management about these concerns.On the up side, the location to everywhere was great. We walked a lot and when it was too hot or far we used Ride Austin. Even though we only ate 1 breakfast at the hotel, it was delicious and the service was impeccable!"
5,Fantastic Blast From the Past,"I attended a small business group meeting here during what could be described as normal Hellish like heat of a Texas summer. At every turn this hotel was an oasis from the city and the heat.Loved my suite, very comfortable and frankly good value on the price too. Location was top and place was clean. Food was great. Highly recommend."
5,Couples weekend trip to Austin,"First time in Austin and this hotel was a gem!! Location was ideal, service was superb and breakfasts in the bakery were outstanding! The Concierge attendants were most helpful on our first trip to town. Great stay!"
5,Great Texas Hotel,"This hotel has a real old Texas feel to it. You are experiencing history. It's right on 6th so you are close to that scene, lots of bars and music. It's pretty close to the Congress Ave. Bridge where you can see the bats and Lady Bird Lake. The bar is a must, even if you aren't staying in the hotel. The Huevos Rancheros at the 1886 Cafe was delish!"
5,Great time,Thanks for a wonderful stay! Always my favorite in Austin! Easy access to everything! Will plan on staying there again! The lobby and dining area are top notch. Enjoyed drinks a the beautiful bar area!
5,Charming & Clean,"I was SO excited to stay at the Driskill while in town for work. While Austin has tons of 4-star hotels, I was hoping to stay somewhere with some local flare and character. Overall I was 100% pleased with my decision to stay here: the room was spotless, the room service quick, and it was walking distance to shops and Soul Cycle :)"
5,Top notch historic hotel,"We visited the Driskill Hotel for a gathering of family and friends to celebrate an upcoming wedding. It was the perfect venue to mingle and to explore Austin. The Yellow Rose suite was our central gathering spot, and included a large room to share conversation, gifts and games. The Driskill bar was a wonderful place to unwind together. The 1886 bar had great breakfast and coffee options, with prices on par with other neighborhood options~ so it made sense to go there for breakfast! Loved my stay at the Driskill. The next time I am in Austin, the Driskill will be my choice!"
5,Very distinctive and stunning hotel..,This was a pleasurable experience I must say! The staff was polite fromt the beginning. The gentleman who checked us in went above and beyond to make us happy as well as the concierge. The room service for dinner was amazing and the style and decor of the hotel is one-of-a-kind and definitely a five star! We plan a return visit soon.
4,Very nice hotel,"I stayed there for a business trip and they have an awesome service. I had a few bottle water that I purchased from the store in my room, and the next day they brought a mini fridge in my room for my bottle of water."
2,Driskill business visit,"The two great features of the Driskill are the location and the cafe, both excellent! However, the hotel grossly lacks in service and quality of staff. Furthermore, the facilities are not up to par as to what one expects for such a property."
2,Beware new management! Rude and illinformed,We have long been fans of The Driskill and always enjoyed our stay. Everyone made us feel comfortable and treated us as valuable. That's all changed with the new management. Save your money and find another place. We wont be back.
4,Historic hotel in convenient downtown Austin location,"The Driskill is an amazing historic hotel and does not disappoint with its connections to Texas and Austin history. The lobby and bar are beautiful with live music and excellent cocktails. The rooms are small but comfortable. The fitness center is well appointed. The location is perfect for checking out Sixth Street. As it is an old property, the hallways smell a bit musty but our room did not. I would have preferred a softer bed and cotton linens, but our room was comfortable."
5,Why would you stay anywhere else in Downtown Austin?!,"QUESTION: Why would you stay anywhere else in Downtown Austin?ANSWER: You wouldn't!Excellent location with wonderful staff, timeless and historical charm.Make sure to enjoy the lounge/bar area for the food, drinks, art, music and characters who hangout."
5,A must!,"This lovely hotel is a must for traveling into the nostalgic, elegant past of 19th century Austin. Just gorgeous! Rooms are small but well-appointed/comfy. Fri PM street closures a challenge for cars."
5,Tour of Austin,"First time visit to the city of Austin, Texas - we wanted to hit all the sights that we could and staying at The Driskill made it possible, from 6th Avenue, to Rainey Street to 2nd Avenue shopping and The bats under the bridge we were able to access it all. The Driskill is a gorgeous hotel, wonderfully appointed and located right in the heart of it all. What a refreshing change from the streets of Austin to walk into this beautifully restored hotel. Rooms were immaculate and beautiful - definitely recommend to any visitor to Austin that wants a hotel ""with character""! Rumor has it that this hotel is haunted, we didn't have any extra visitors! Bar and restaurant are great also - but if you are in for a ""taste of Austin"" make sure you hit Lambert's and Terry Black's BBQ!"
5,Bar Review - What a Gem!!!,"We decided to check out the Driskell’s bar off a tip from a friend. What a great find! First, we entered through the gorgeous and historic lobby. The bar was all dark wood and copper ceiling. We had a delightful server, Sarah, who gave us great service. The short menu yielded tasty food, all with live, light jazz music."
5,Awesome stay!!!,"Staff is very helpful and friendly. Staff went out of way to help us get what we wanted, which was a room on the historic side. After a while the manager was able to accommodate us and compensated breakfast for the inconvenience and told us what to do in the future to ensure we always get a room on the historic side and even put it on our profile for future stays."
1,Preying on unsuspecting tourists,"At Check In, they tried to sell me an upgrade. When I declined, they assigned us to Room 525, which is known for being haunted.The only parking is valet parking at $45 per day. It would be good if the staff could tell guests about a nice parking garage, only 4 1/2 blocks away. The rate is $5 after 5PM, and on Sat and Sun."
4,Gussied-up grande dame,"The fabled Drizzie of bygone times has had a facelift (perhaps one of several) and she's looking really good these days since Hyatt took it over for their unbound collection. Each room is different, however, so be certain you ask for something with a larger bathroom if they have it. I prefer the old wing with super wide hallways and art gallery en route. The beds are extremely comfortable (I tried two different rooms). And even though the hotel fronts on Sixth Street -- Austin's Music Hub, lined with bars and clubs -- the rooms are totally quiet.Hotel has a great lounge on the second floor (where you go to get an elevator -- an annoyance) with live music in the late afternoon and evening. The talent there is estimable, and some folks just grab a table and spend the evening, far from the madding crowd. In fact, with their inhouse Spa, and Gold's Gym across the street, you don't have to go far to have a good time. But then, Austin calls. So consider using Uber or Lyft which is very convenient and reasonable for the most part. Having a car is optimal, but pricey...3 days with Hertz cost $500+ and the hotel charges the going rate for parking: $45 per day for in and out service. And they haven't gotten the glitches out of their service yet...sometimes you wish you had taken a car service instead. However, the hotel service is second to none, and JC at the front desk, makes any troubles go away. I took away a star for the bathroom, flight of stairs to the elevator and the parking. Otherwise, a five star property."
3,The hotel is a historic place with fantastic architecture and history.,"It is conveniently located in the heart of Austin with most attractions within walking distance. The restaraunts in the hotel were good quality that offered the same meals in your room. Unfortunately, our private balcony was covered in pidgeon poop which rendered it unusable."
3,Such a let down,"Such high hopes for a great stay at this history rich beauty. Staff and service simply do not measure up. Room was clean. Valet parking was fast and a real necessity. The location is convenient to restaurants, bars, Voodo Donuts, and a large homeless encampment.... It was nice to visit but definitely wouldn't go back, at least not to stay."
4,Interesting architecture,"Fascinating place. Lovely atmosphere. We had a house salad, which was pleasant enough and a lemonade which was nice too. Service was good but just sitting in the room and having a relaxing chat was best and The Driskill atmosphere encourages that."
5,Just go!,"If you’re not familiar with this hotel’s amazing history, do yourself a favor and read up just a little. There is a colorful and fascinating history that will only enhance your stay. The property is simply beautiful. The restoration of the hotel was impeccably done, keeping both the historical context and grandeur without compromising the warmth and heart of this very special place. The staff is beyond reproach. Courteous, helpful, kind and welcoming. They exude southern hospitality without giving you a cavity. If you appreciate design, give yourself time to just wander around the halls and porticos and imagine LBJ and Lady Bird on their first date; or any one of their many, many return visits.There is so much to see: historical portraits, artifacts and letters, to stained glass to intricate woodwork. Please make sure to visit Cafe 1886. We had breakfast there throughout our stay. The food is fresh, simple and perfect. The service is attentive without crowding you. There is a cinnamon roll that literally could feed a family of six. Despite the temptation, being but two people fearful of our blood sugar levels, we decided to forego the treat until we return with all the family in tow to offset the damage, er, I mean to share.The hotel itself is worth visiting Austin, but- it also has a fantastic location relative to this town’s live music scene. Walk right out the front door and you are in 6th street, the epicenter of the music scene. There is literally door to door live music.If the music gives you cause for concern about noise, The Driskill thought of that, too. The tower rooms (the “newer” part of the hotel, facing downtown’s music scene) have a white noise machine on the nightstand that was easy enough for this non-technical person to operate. Note: we turned in before midnight every night and did not need to use the white noise once.Also, many of the historic rooms face the interior of the hotel. They all have their own unique identity and may offer a little more quiet if you’re looking for that.Just go, really!"
5,Bucket List,"My son took me here so I wouldn’t have to walk too far in the heat to 6th Street - he now states he will never stay anywhere else in Austin. Steeped in history I could feel the cattle barons and their ladies drifting throughout the hotel! Brunch is an absolute MUST, at least once. Located convenient to the bars, restaurants and great music of Austin. The staff were great while being unobtrusive. I’m with my son, if I get to go back it will be to The Driskill!"
5,Loved this hotel,"My family and I stayed there for a few days over the 4th of July holiday. From the moment we pulled up we felt welcomed! Everyone was so kind! I will come back! The food was good, the beds were wonderful (major plus on the sheets - I want a set of them so bad!) We didn't have enough time to go to the bar, but did walk through it to get to the elevators and they had a live band playing Country music - which was very nice! I recommend this place to everyone!"
5,"Unique, well located, and comfy.","We stayed at the Driskill for 4 nights during 4th of July with some friends. Right before the stay I was concerned after getting a follow from an Instagram account warning us not to stay at the Driskill. It was a bunch of terrible reviews consolidated. We had exactly the opposite experience.The place is a beautiful mix of old-world design and luxury blended with great service and wonderful amenities. It is centrally located so your Austin adventure is right at your fingertips. We loved the unique touches in our room, coffees in the cafe, and a fantastic hotel bar filled with leather, wood, and nostalgia. Do yourself a favor and get the truffle popcorn and the queso. Dip popcorn in queso. Magic!Only a couple of downsides. If there is access to the stair I could not find it. I wanted that due to incredibly slow elevators. Not a big deal, but I'd rather hoof it up the stairs than be patient. No pool, which would have been nice as hot as Austin can get. Maybe access to a sister property pool is available?"
5,Elegant & Beautiful & Historic,Beautiful hotel. Love the history associated with it and the fact that inagural balls were held there. Convenient to areas downtown and walking distance to the State Capitol of Texas.Friendly and helpful staff.
5,Roadtrip2018,"Awesome and beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff and service. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Very conveniently located at 6th street, good access to restaurants, bars, and music. The staff and service were top notch."
4,1886,I choose the Driskill because of the Historic significance of this Hotel. I have been to the Menger in San Antonio and the Driskill is much more opulent. I did not expect this level of cleanliness and luxury in a Hotel built in 1886. Felt like I should have shown up on horse back!!!
3,Beautiful Historic Hotel But Checked out Early,"Looked like it was a great historical place to stay 20 years ago and I asked myself as I had to schlep heavy luggage up a stairway into the bar then to an elevator, exactly what did Hyatt's Unbound collection add to the property other than a reservation system to sell more rooms for the owners? They seemed to add zero value to room quality or experience. It definitely is America's version of a Grand Dame Hotel which means too old to leave a meaningful impression. The room while clean had generations of caulk in the tub shower and sinks were tiny pedestals with zero counter space, walls were amazingly thin, with acoustics only a spy would love. There was no hot water in the room for our morning showers. This was frustrating as we tried to wash off the grime of a prior evening Austin city street stroll! Front desk did comp the $45 valet parking fee (gulp) for no hot water. This was our first and last time in Austin and I really wanted to like this hotel for the history as well as the city. Austin itself with all the street bums and strife, made Manhattan look pristine. This city is no second coming of Palo Alto.. Both were just plain disappointing so we cancelled our second night and drove outta dodge ASAP."
5,"Quick stop, first class","We dropped into Austin for one night. The Driskill was perfect. Great staff, super nice rooms and bar. Use the valet for sure as the homeless are nearby. Lots of great restaurants nearby but Driskill has a terrific restaurant."
3,A tired hotel,"The personnel were friendly and they did their best to accommodate us. We paid extra for a deluxe room which was nice. However, the view overlooked the hotel's AC units! The parking was exorbitant at $45 per night."
3,Driskill is past it's prime !,Hotel is run down and looks to be neglected in the maintenance areas! Compared to other hotels with equal ratings on Trip Advisor this one has slipped through the cracks. Lobby area was used as a dining area for the breakfast restaurant .. when trying to relax there was no place to sit peacefully !
5,Excellent Hotel in Perfect Location,"I met a friend at the Driskill Hotel for a quick 3 day vacation. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the rooms are equally nice- comfortable beds and very clean. The location is perfect- within walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go. The hotel was a little in the expensive side- but since my friend and I split the bill, it wasn't that bad. The desk staff were very helpful with recommendations for restaurants and places to go."
5,A Gem in Austin,"Had a wonderful experience at The Driskill . Excellent accomodations, excellent food , excellent bar and entertainment. Well worth the cost. Was in town for my son's proposal to his girlfriend...now fiancee'. She said yes and I say yes to the City of Austin and The Driskill."
3,Disappointed at The Driskill,"Chose The Driskill for our 25th anniversary. Very average overall stay. The LBJ Suite was our room...probably really awesome during it's day but now needs to be refreshed and touched-up. Girl at the front desk was borderline snotty at check-in..guess a Columbia fishing shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes didn't garner ""her approval"" for a $700+ room... sorta set the tone for the stay. No guest amenities with the suite unless you count the $4 cokes and water in your room so no real advantage to the suite due to lack of concierge items..maybe a complimentary drink at happy hour or complimentary coffee in the morning....but @ $700/night there's no room to pamper the guest. Girl at check-out didn't really appreciate my comments about the morning coffee..well at lest folks in the Cafe were nice."
4,Very Good and Fond Memories,I was in Austin for a business meeting and chose the Driskell because my step-father's office was next door when I was a teenager. We ate there often 55 years ago. The hotel has been wonderfully restored / maintained.The valet experience on arrival was not as good as one might expect. The check in experience was very good but the route to our guest room was circuitous. Our room was very nice and well maintained. The hall and guest room door frames were somewhat scarred.We ate in the dinning room which was nit as busy as it should have been given the very good service and excellent service. The bar was very busy that evening.Breakfast in the street level restaurant with historic décor was excellent both as to service and food preparation.The wait for our car from thee valet when we left was too long.
4,"Historic, well-located, haunted?","For my first trip to Austin, the Driskill was one of the hotels that offered perks through my favourite online travel agency. Another was the Four Seasons, which I also considered, but it was pricier. Also, we found out when visiting the Four Seasons that it was in the midst of a massive renovation of its 2 public floors--a stay here at this time would have been noisy and inconvenienced.The Driskill has a great central location on the corner of Brazos St. and 6th St., which has several blocks of restaurants/bars offering live music. I was surprised at the number of homeless folks around the hotel and the downtown area in general. Congress Ave. is 1 block west. This is the street that leads up to the Texas State Capitol, and whose bridge over the river is home to over a million bats who provide a free show nightly in the summer when they fly out en masse seeking food.The Driskill first opened in 1886, built by cattle baron ""Colonel"" Jesse Driskill. Austin was voted as Texas' state capitol in 1872, the current Capitol building opened in 1888. In the past 130+ years, the hotel has gone through many good times and bad times. There have been numerous changes in ownership, closures, threats of demolition, renovations. Several state governors had their inaugural balls here, and former President Lyndon B. Johnson had his first date with future wife Lady Bird here. Since 2013, the hotel has been part of Hyatt Hotels' Unbound Collection.The hotel's lobby is grand, stately and well-preserved, with many visitors/gawkers, including some on Haunted Austin tours (they travel in a converted hearse)--more later on the haunted Driskill. The lobby has entrances off both 6th and Brazos. The 1886 Cafe and Bakery, which actually opened in 2002 in honour of the original 1886 Lunchroom, is on this level. It serves breakfast, lunch and weekend brunch. Our package included breakfast here, see separate review.The Driskill Bar and Driskill Grill are located half a level up, just beyond the huge portrait of ""Colonel"" Driskill (""Colonel"" was an honourary title). The popular copper-ceiling bar has live music nightly, and a Sunday Blues Brunch in conjunction with famed Antone's Nightclub. Both the food and drink menus looked tantalizing, but alas, we did not try either. Neither did we try the Driskill Grill, partly because it was closed 2 of our 3 nights in Austin. It serves a pretty classic steakhouse menu.We checked-in on the Saturday of a busy weekend in Austin, so the room upgrade we were eligible for with our package was not available. We were told by Amanda to check back Sunday for upgrade availability. Among other events, the ATX Television Festival was here, with many events held at the historic Paramount Theatre and historic InterContinental Stephen F. Austin Hotel around the corner. Bigger and MUCH noisier was the annual Republic of Texas Biker Rally, which closed down Congress Ave. for a parade on Friday (before our arrival), and closed 6th St. on Saturday, when the street became a showcase for Harleys.Our first room was in the Tower Wing, a newer wing opened in 1930 that has, I think 9 floors. The Historic Wing has 5 floors, but the 2 wings only connect seamlessly on the mezzanine level; short stairways connect the wings on floors 4 and 5. Not being a fan of ghosts, I had requested a non-haunted room. The corner room with 2 windows had a queen bed. The only chair was the desk chair. The nightstands were cutely designed to look like leather-strapped steamer trunks. I liked how the nightstand lamp bases had electrical outlets and USB port in their bases. There were 2 phones for the compact room. The minibar and fridge were auto-sensored to charge you almost as soon as an item is removed. There was NO complimentary water; water in 2 sizes was part of the minibar/fridge! There was a ceiling fan and white noise machine, which we used to muffle the sound of the Harleys heard even from our far corner. The bathroom was tiny but not lacking in amenities. In the evening, a jar full of earplugs was thoughtfully placed by the 2 elevators.The next day, Richard and then Veronica were very helpful in getting us a room upgrade. We were offered a choice of rooms beyond the upgrade we were eligible for at a reasonable cost. We ultimately chose one of the four Landmark Suites, all of which are in the Historic Wing and are individually sized and decorated. Ours was on the 5th floor with a terrace on the corner of 6th and Brazos, which would have been the noisiest corner of the hotel the night before. At first, the 5th floor location gave me pause because that is supposedly the hotel's most haunted floor, but in the end there was no paranormal activity for us. The Historic Wing has but 2 slow, small elevators, one of which is supposedly haunted.The suite was 700+ square feet, with very high ceilings and a four-poster king bed. I frankly liked the decor of our original smaller room better. Here, furniture that was supposed to look antique instead just seemed cheap and worn. And with the suites unique shape and windows, some things just didn't ""fit"". The small desk was squeezed into a corner that prevented the closed door from being opened fully. There was no desktop lamp or electrical outlet. The huge draped canopy over the bed headboard totally blocked the majority of the historic windows. The nightstands were not cute steamer trunks but small tables that had lamps with NO outlets or ports. The terrace had 2 wicker rocking chairs and a small table. We didn't spend a lot of time on the terrace because of the heat and because a homeless man who lived caddy-corner liked to play his ""drums"" throughout the day. There was only one phone.The bathroom, however, was quite impressive--double sinks, filled with marble (including arches over the tub!), a huge shower (big enough for 3 people with 3 heads, although one had no hot water), and an ever huger circular jacuzzi tub which, being from drought-conscious southern CA, we just couldn't bring ourselves to use without pangs of guilt. This being a suite, we were given evening turndown service, which included a yellow rose placed on the bed. Still no free water, though. and a big niggle was when we came back from breakfast at 8:30am to find housekeeping already there. We had to leave and loll about in the lobby until they finished.Our single experience with room service was subpar. The menu states that meals aside from breakfast are served ""to-go"" style in take-out containers that can be picked up at the concierge desk or delivered to your room. We placed an order around 9:30 pm with the front desk because no one answered the In-Room Dining button on the phone. Food came an hour later only after we called again. We were given a large paper bag, for which there was still the standard 20+% service charge and delivery charge! As noted, the food came on biodegradable paper plates with plastic covers and plastic cutlery. I wonder how these utensils would work for someone who ordered a steak off the Driskill Grill room service menu?As for the hotel being haunted, stories abound on the internet, including some involving Colonel Driskill himself. Room 525 seems to have some notoriety (did 2 brides commit suicide in this room 20 years apart to the day?), as does a painting of a young girl holding a bouquet of flowers (is she the daughter of a US Senator who tripped and fell to her death chasing a ball down the grand staircase?). All I know is that the hotel's corridors are lined with hundreds of reproduction oil paintings, some of which are portraits of unknown people who stare at you and follow you with their eyes, like those portraits in Disneyland's Haunted Mansion attraction. When I passed the young girl's portrait, it sent shivers down my spine, and this was before I knew the painting's story. There were some portraits of men with spooky eyes also--we tried to avoid all of them. By our room, there were landscapes only, thank goodness.Despite the hotel's quirks and niggles, the stay was enjoyable. I've stayed in several historic hotels in the past where, like the Driskill, the historic aspects do not mesh perfectly with 21st century technology or design. And a historic hotel without haunting stories probably does not exist."
5,Gorgeous property,"The hubs & I stayed here while in Austin. Our room was one of those newly remodeled. The new decor is lovely and on trend while still maintaining an historical feel. The property is full of history and a true Texas gem. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. We would return."
5,6th Street convenient and a little haunting,"We love staying at the Driskill when we are in Austin. Everything downtown is in walking distance.We enjoyed a fun weekend of a night of dinner, music and libations, all within a few blocks, on Friday night.On Saturday we spent the day at the State Capitol and shopping all within a short walk from the Driskill.We did not request, but were booked into room 525. Apparently the most haunted room at the hotel. We didn’t know it at the time, but I did experience flickering lights in the bathroom. While at lunch we read that 525 was a room where a tragedy took place in that bathroom. Kind of creepy, but adds to the mystique of this fabulous old hotel.Rooms are very clean, comfortable beds.Architecture is beautiful, the building is loaded with stained glass.Great bar with lots of history. The cafe is good for breakfast too.We love the Driskill and will go back!"
3,Lost my reservation 6 months in advance of my daughter's wedding!,"It would be really, really easy to zero this hotel review just because they lost our reservations. Not just any reservation, but the reservation I made there for my daughter's wedding. Had booked a suite for us and a room for Grandma only to find that they lost our reservation. Ended up with Okay rooms, but not the Suite we reserved. It's an old worn out hotel in need of updates and if it weren't for the beautiful bar, there really wouldn't be much to talk about."
5,Anniversary Celebrate,"Very nice experience. The hotel meet and greet was most gracious and we booked a room with 2 queens, clean and fresh and large. Oddly the room had no full length mirror??? Makeup mirror sits on a low table about 1 1/2 foot off the floor....no way to use. The bath could use some shelving though. Coffee in room was exceptionally tasty. They introduced a Sunday Blues Brunch which was definitely the highlight of our stay. Future guest might need reservations for this quite a way in advance since it will really take off. With a $35 per person charge for outstanding eats plus a live band sounding like New Orleans they will have a winner. Dinner for our anniversary was quite memorable with super service and tasty (while pricey) menu items."
4,Historic Austin,"My visit at the Driskill was very good. I've stayed at the property a few times. If you want a genuine historic experience, this is the hotel for you in Austin. The rooms were well appointed, and overall the property was very accommodating. The reason for not giving a 5 star rating is often times ""little fish get lost in a big pond!"" Not overly individualized service."
5,Historic with a healthy dose of weird outside the door,You can feel the history and beauty as you walk in the door. The Blackberry Smash in the lounge was my husband favourite..and he is a beer guy. The hallway on your floor is gorgeous w artwork. Can’t beat the location. Worth the extra couple of dollars.
1,Zero Sleep,"I was sold an “upgrade” to city view room. They said sixth street room could not be promised to be quiet. Room looked at the side of building next door. The alley bellow had dumpsters. The dumpsters were emptied multiple times between 2 & 4:30 AM. Wife and I had worst nights sleep ever. Exhausted next day. I would have saved the money and slept at the hostel across the street. Stay anywhere but Driskill. Wife and I had wanted to stay there because old historic hotel. Do yourself a favor, stay elsewhere and visit the hotel just to look at."
3,Left me a bit disappointed,The location of The Driskill is amazing but the room itself was not. The carpet in my entry way was wet when I got there. I reported it to a hotel staff but didn’t hear anything back. My room had a slight sour smell the rest of the time. The bathroom was so tiny that you had to keep the door shut in order to use the sink or mirror. I was just surprised that such a fancy hotel had such a crappy bathroom set up. I did enjoy having the ceiling fan.
4,Excellent accommodations and service.,"I studied in Austin as a young adult and always wanted to stay at the Driskill, the stately Victorian hotel in downtown Austin. I finally got my opportunity while attending a conference 30 years later and finding that rooms in the conference hotel were sold out. The décor in the common places at the Driskill is lovely and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. I am happy that the character of the hotel and the quality of service has not changed at this elegant, old hotel, but the homelessness problem in Austin makes being downtown less pleasant than when I was a student there. Also, the rooms on the upper floors are accessed by one, aged elevator. This can be frustrating if you are in a hurry because it is extremely slow. Give yourself extra time when using it."
3,Historic and outdated,Really beautiful old hotel. Had a suite that was huge but really outdated. Not my favorite hotel in Austin. The four Seasons Hotel blow this hotel away. Hotel is in a great location. Didn't have time to use the workout facility or eat at the restaurant. A true historic landmark.
5,30th Anniversary Splurge,"My husband and I have been going to the ROT Rally for the last 7 years. Our 30th Anniversary was this year, so we waited to celebrate during the rally. We thought we would do it right and stay at the Driskill. We got one of the rooms with the balcony on it, so we could hang outside late at night or in the morning and watch the bikes downtown. It was going to be a hot weekend and it WAS! We enjoyed the in room dining for breakfast and a snack later on Saturday night. Everyone was so nice to us. The room was amazing. Ridiculous tall ceilings! Even made my hubby look short and he is 6'4"". No regrets this weekend."
5,Business Trip/Stay at the Driskill,I stayed at the Driskill for one night for a business trip and loved it. The customer service is unmatched. The robes in the room are so comfy. The rooms are cleaned to perfection and everything you might possibly need is already in the room.
5,What a nice surprise,"I stayed at the hotel for a multi-day business meeting. It was a pleasant experience. The location is great and the meals we had that were catered by the hotel were very good. I was actually surprised at how comfortable the room was, given the hotel's age and overall architecture. I had a great night's sleep despite my room's location near both the ice machine room and an elevator. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of room. The bathroom was a tad small, but it was authentic. I will return if in Austin again."
5,WOW!!,"We stayed at the Driskill for four nights of our honeymoon in Austin and it was AMAZING! Our room was great, lovely big bed with a lovely bathroom and dreamy AC not forgetting the incredible service. The hotel is full of history which was truly fascinating ask David the porter, he’s got loads of cool facts! The staff made such a fuss of us and spoilt us with prosecco, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room each day!! Big shout out to Trina who was the lovely lady who cleaned our room and was responsible for the strawberries! Also big thanks to Amanda who sorted out quickly an issue with our booking on arrival which was an error from our travel agent. And David who educated us on the Driskill’s amazing history. Thank you for making our stay so so special, we miss you!"
5,Quick trip to Austin,Wonderful hotel and great location. Food and Bar are very good and it was a step back in time with some really cool History of the Hotel and the area. Right on 6th Street so plenty of things to do and to eat and Drink
5,Texas Hospitality,"Great place to stay, relax, see Austin and have solitude. For anyone traveling to the Austin area, I would highly recommend a trip to stay there for a night or simply to view the beautiful history of a classy building in Texas."
5,thirst,"Wonderful service, beautiful historical ambience, delightful breakfast at the 1886 Bakery. We were disappointed that there wasn't at least a bottle each of free water in the room. Bring bottled water unless you want to pay big bucks."
5,Nice to see,Old hotel . Near 6th street so why not stop in . You can walk around hotel which is supposedly haunted!The have a nice restaurant and lounge area with band . The lounge has food too. I liked the art .
5,Joseph Buonincontri,"I stayed last weekend for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much. I have two children living in Austin and I can see why the love the city so much.I had great service in the bar area. Dayna did a fantastic job working alone on a busy evening.David the bartender was very professional and provided great service as well.My daughter and I enjoyed the Sunday brunch while Antone’s did their thing. Really nice experience.Glad to meet Julie the director of sales.I had a long Hotel career before opening a restaurant in San Antonio. I always enjoy speaking with the staff at hotels.To the General Manager of the Driskill Hotel , you have great people working for you,Congratulations to you!"
5,The Driskill knows how to pamper people and pooches!,"The Driskill never gets old. Well maintained and one of my fave places to stay when I'm in Austin. Location is always the best for business. Always enjoy working out in the fitness room overlooking downtown Austin. Driskill Grill is a must dine experience and always enjoyed by clients. Pampered Pet program is thoroughly enjoyed by my two miniature dachshunds as are the gourmet dog treats. While they stay in their crates while I'm meeting or dining with clients or friends, they love outdoor walks near the Driskill and the staff spoils them with attention. It feels like staying at a close friend's home."
1,Management Failure,"Driskill bar, 9:30 Tuesday, wet sweaty guy in his workout clothes, earpiece phone, loud phone conversation, standing at the bar drinking his beer. Why do I have to see this? Pathetic. Thought this was a classy bar, guess not. Take my friends and my cash somewhere else next time Good luck Driskill, sure I’m not the only one who noticed."
5,The Driscoll is fantastic!,"Take time to visit this historic hotel in the heart of Austin . . . beautiful, historical hotel where the employees genuinely care about the visitors and value the history of a great place! The room was stylish, historic and in great condition - clean organized and decorated beautifully."
3,Texas Road Trip 2018,"We’ve stayed at the Driscoll in past before the Hyatt bought it a few years ago. While the lobby , bar and public places still are fantastic, it has slipped a lot in our room.Broken tile in bath, paint needed, curtains dirty. Not a 5- star experience any longer. But they sure are more than willing to charge you 5 star rates. We stayed on a Thursday night prior to Memorial Day. When we arrived they told us they could upgrade our room. Options of $100 - $150.We had just had a five star experience at Drury Riverwalk for just $175 total in a fantastic room, including our parking. So we were not keen on tripling our cost for a single night here so we passed. Then we found out they could’t accommodate our car because we towed a small u-haul. Which the Drury easy accepted just blocks from the Alamo in a secure garage for $35.Our final cost to park a block and a half away in a in-secure lot. $160 for the night.They gave us a handicapped room on 3rd floor over the delivery and garbage pick-up. In the end at triple the cost, our experience at the Driskill was 2-3 star at best. The Hyatt seems happy to rely on the past A+ gem reputation of this grand old hotel and invest nothing in upkeep and update of rooms- and willing to push upgrade charges in a partially booked hotel and let their clients suffer a bad experience. When we checked out the front desk sympathized and said they had been hearing a lot of our same concerns.No longer a premium hotel."
5,A Great Experience,A beautiful Hotel. Great service. Location in the heart of the city.The ambiance of the bar is warm & welcoming. The onsite restaurant food was very good. There is a coffee bar with wonderful pastries thatis handy for a quick breakfast.
5,A truly exemplary stay!,"The entire staff was exceptional. JC Jordan (at the front desk) and Christine (at the concierge desk) are hospitality champions.As a meeting planner who has booked more than 300,000 room nights over the last 36 years, among 24 states, I can say that this was one of the most remarkable stays - ever.We were in Austin for my daughter's graduation. I had a number of family members with me. And we had several special requests. The staff embraced every request as an opportunity to own the moment and to make it memorable.The food outlets and staff are all FABULOUS.The rooms and room staff are FABULOUS.The facility, the setting, the history, and every single employee is pristine and polished.This is a sparkling example of how great a property can be.Cheers to the symphony of leadership, training and staff that make this property a brilliant jewel.Sincerest thanks and respect,Steve MayesHouston, Texas"
3,Not as expected for a high end hotel,"It was average. The room was near the elevator, super small bathroom and awkward layout, missing mirror on wall (decorative), plumbing issues (toilet wouldn’t flush and tub wouldn’t drain). Operator did not answer phone. Had to go downstairs to report issues we were having."
5,Four Nights in Austin,"We were celebrating Mr B’s birthday so treated ourselves by booking this hotel. It is opulent and historic. The staff were first class. We were very grateful to the concierge staff, particularly Jasmine. Thank you for your excellent help and great recommendations.The 1886 Bakery has a great selection of fresh food and drinks. We had wanted to eat at the hotel’s restaurant but unfortunately they had functions and they were fully booked.We had a couple of minor irritations. We had to take two elevators to get to our room, which was annoying but not a problem. Mr B, who suffers from a bad back, found the mattress too soft for his liking. We had an early flight and had requested a taxi. It was not available when we were ready to leave, so that was a little disappointing.Our room did not have a plug for the bathtub but this was provided immediately when we asked for it. Our room was comfortable and well equipped. The toiletries provided were very good quality.We used the bar, which is beautiful. It is worth visiting even if you don’t have a drink.This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. It is stunning and has a lot of history. We loved Austin and plan to stay at The Driskill again when we return. No hesitation to recommend this hotel."
3,Spend thousands on your wedding... expect the going rate,"Before getting into my recent disappointment, I want to say that I gave this hotel 3 stars (instead of 1) because our wedding at the Driskill was amazing. Great food, atmosphere (on the mezzanine)... everyone had a blast. We went all out.... best food, top shelf alcohol, cake from the 1886 Bakery downstairs.... That's why I feel so upset about recent experience....My husband and I were married at the Driskill in 2009. Our anniversary is coming up so I thought it would be fun to fly in to Austin and stay at the Driskill for a night. Our wedding planner at the time told us to contact her anytime we wanted to come back and stay; that she would comp a room or at least get us a great rate. Our wedding planner is no longer there (which I didn't expect after 9 years) and I know that the Driskill was purchased by Hyatt after our wedding. I assumed we wouldn't get a free night when I called but at least a really good discount. After 9 years, this was the very first time I called about making a reservation.I first asked about the LBJ suite on the mezzanine level (now one of the Landmark suites) and they offered $379 for the one night. I thought about it a few days and decided I didn't want to spend that much. I called back the next week and asked for a regular room. One night... on a Wednesday, not a weekend..... I figured we could get a pretty good deal. I get a call back that they are ""very happy"" to offer me the ""great rate"" of $244. Ugh. It wasn't what I wanted to hear but thought ""Oh well...It will be fun for us to go back.""Well, I probably should have left it at that. Instead, my curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to check the advertised rates online for the same exact night. It is one DOLLAR more.... $245!!!!So I spend an obscene amount of money to have my wedding there (obscene to me at least) PLUS all of the money you made in room charges from our guests staying the weekend..... and you offer me the same exact rate that anyone else can get??!!! Oh wait, I did get a dollar off.Needless to say I'm cancelling the reservation tomorrow. Don't want to give Driskill or any other Hyatt one more dime."
5,Clean and well-maintained; friendly and courteous staff.,"We stayed for two nights to attend a business on site. I was impressed with the clean and well-maintained room - the bed and pillows were so comfortable; the staff was friendly, helpful, and courteous."
5,Worth the extra $$!,We attended a wedding at the Driskall and the service and attention to detail was outstanding. Our room was quaint and cozy. Very comfortable. We ate at the Grill which was also excellent. I ordered the filet and my wife had the salmon. Both were excellent. We split a wedge lettuce salad which was served individually which was nice. Great location for all the activities in Austin.
5,The Driskill -- Best Hotel in Austin,"The Driskill is an incredible hotel and literally a walk through time to the late 1800's/early 1900's. Fascinating history. Top of the line accommodations, service, and location. Try the desserts at the 1800's bakery on property."
4,Anniversary Weekend,"Loved this hotel! We chose to stay here because of its history. We arrived early evening on Friday, May 11th. The room was wonderful! The bed was extra comfortable.The hall ways were gorgeous. We loved walking around the hotel.The only complaint we had is that the valet was less than friendly (reason for the 4 star). As the first “face of the Driskill” to a customer it was definitely not a good first impression. The guy seemed bothered to have to talk to us. Later on as we were leaving for dinner I asked him a question regarding taxi or uber, he answered but again just seemed bothered. We avoided that door thereafter. The next day when we picked our car up around noon the valet was very friendly and happy to help us."
4,Historic and maybe Haunted.,"The hotel has an elegance and charm to it! Great place for our conference. The room was large and quiet. The bathroom was small, and I could not extend my stay for one more hour before checkout (to coincide with the end of the conference I was attending). Overall, it was a good experience, and I didn't see any ghosts."
5,Great lunch,"I had the fried chicken and my friend had the hanger burger. Special 3 day preparation on the chicken and the result was heavenly! The burger, with bacon and a fried egg, looked good too. The drinks were good but a little expensive."
4,Beautiful space for a drink,A wonderful space to visit – even if you don’t have a drink. We stopped in for a nightcap and sat at the bar. The bartenders were nice but not overly attentive. Be prepared to spend a little extra on drinks here – pretty sure you’re paying for the ambiance. It is a wonderful old building that has been wonderfully restored and maintained.
5,The Ghost will Greet You,The center of Austin hospitality starts here as it is Austin’s oldest operating hotel. Located right on 6th Street in the middle of downtown this place has a lot of character. You can easily imagine yourself arriving on horseback to check in. The service is extravagant and will assist you with all your needs. I have spent a lot of time throughout the years hanging out here.Noticed it is operated by Hyatt so now you can get points to stay here. I had a brief tour of the lobby on its history and learned when it was build it had some businesses on the first floor like a bank. I walked into the old safe vault and been renovated as a private work area and lock boxes. It was very interesting.During Christmas this a must to visit where they decorate it very nicely and have a tree lighting ceremony. If you drive here then recommend parking valet where not sure where the parking garage is since was built before automobiles.The 1886 Cafe & Bakery is really good and nice place to hangout. The bar is upstairs and really old school luxurious with lots of dark wood. The selections of liquors are higher quality than other hotels.It’s a very historic hotel and worth visiting.
3,A Little Disappointed,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Driskill for our anniversary trip. Our stay was okay, but I didn't feel it was worth the cost. Because the hotel is an older building, I was expecting the lack of a pool and outdoor space to be made up for with exceptional customer service, but it was not. I felt like we could have been staying anywhere. We rarely interacted with staff in the lobby at all as the check-in desk is set back from the entrance and staircase up to the tower elevator and I never really saw staff"
4,One night,We stayed for one night in December. We stayed in a queen petite room room with breakfast included. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the season. I found the reception staff to not be that friendly. We were offered an upgrade which I regret not taking as the petite room we had did not have an actual window. It was a bit cramped! Breakfast was great.
5,Taste of Austin Love,We enjoyed a romantic weekend away at the Driskill. The hotel is beautifully restored and shows respect and love for its rich history. Excellent location. Fun to see Austinites arriving in tea garb for fancy Sunday tea. Very friendly and helpful staff.
4,Grand Hotel; Step Back In Time,"A truly grand hotel. Easy to get the feel of grandeur from the 1886 timeframe of early Austin days. Flawless, spacious and beautiful decor downstairs and throughout lobbies. Staff very friendly and helpful. Facilities like the grill room, bar, ballroom and 1886 brunch areas are wonderful to take in.Rooms are modest but adequate. Reasonably comfortable."
5,21st Anniversary,"Words can't explain how beautiful this historic hotel. I decided to treat my husband for our anniversary to Austin, Texas!! I wanted a diamond hotel which I got... I got one of the themes room (renissance)which was a great choice for the occasion.. when I tell you that went over and beyond to make my 21st anniversary rememberable😍😍😍 the rose petals, our cake, the champagne , and the view from 6th street was the topping on the cake!!We had awesome time and I can't wait to come back."
4,Quaint Historic Hotel in the heart of Downtown Austin,We stayed here one night for work and it was great! The hotel staff was super helpful and friendly. The rooms were very clean and had a lot of charm. The location is also great for walking around downtown Austin. There’s a great cafe attached for breakfast and brunch and a bar which had live music at night!
5,Amazing experience,"Felt like a dream pulling up and waking up. An amazing experience I'd encourage others to have. Well worth it and we will be back! Staff was welcoming and non-judgmental, friendly and seemed to genuinely care about our time there."
2,Expensive experience for a room that wasn't worth it!,"We were given a handicap room with no warning. The bathroom was awful with countertop at all. The room looked dated. Only one extra chair in the room so room service for two did not work well. The price of the room was way, way too much for what we got. Never again!"
5,SO worth the price!!,"We visited Austin to attend a concert and stayed at the Driskill - since we were there just one night, we wanted a great and special experience... and that's exactly what we got!! Don't miss this gem!"
5,One Business Travel Night,"This hotel is spectacular. It is still one of my favorite's to stay in while in Austin. I came in late and was only there for one night/day, but the staff was super friendly and the room was nice. Great stay for the night!"
5,A Historic Hotel in a Great Location,"While some may feel it is dated, and on occasion the rooms have unique features or are strangely configured, the hotel has great staff and historic features that differentiate it from the Omni, Westin or Four Seasons."
2,Old Hotel and Smells Like It,"While this is one of the most unique hotels in the downtown area-very old and opulent, its age has caught up with it. Upon arrival there was a strong, and ongoing mold smell that never went away throughout the hotel. The room had the best air quality, but for the price the experience of staying there in light of the odor and discomfort of the air quality was not worth staying again for me."
5,Luxury + Location,"Overall: Upscale hotel in the heart of the Austin action. Definitely where I would stay the next time I'm in the area.Arrival: There appeared to be no self-parking option, but the valet guys were all courteous, prompt, and attentive. The check-in process was smooth and seamless. The elevator was a bit small and slow, but fine for an older building. We loved that there was a mini-library on our floor outside the elevator. My husband grabbed a couple of books to read during our stay.The Room: Very luxurious with high ceilings and upscale finishes throughout. As soon as we walked in the door, there was a foyer area with classic columns. The bathroom had the ""D"" insignia for the hotel in the sink and on the shower glass - very classy. Loved the sheets on the bed. Very comfortable accommodations.Location: The hotel is located right at the edge of the Sixth Street area, so it was convenient to walk up and down to see the bars/restaurants, but still have some separation, so it wasn't too loud at night. It was also located a few easy blocks away from the state capitol building.My only disappointment, was that I sent an email about making a reservation for afternoon tea. Walking through the lobby, I saw a number of empty tables, but I got a response the following day saying that they had been full.Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed staying at this hotel."
5,Beautiful. Classic. A must,"Amazing historic Austin hotel. I have stayed in many old hotels and they always feel old. Rooms are usually tiny. Not so at the D. Everything is bigger in Texas. Staff is great. Location is perfect for getting to all areas. Everything is basically walkable. Located right on 6th St if music is your thing it’s perfect. Also quick walks to warehouse dist, the Capitol, 2nd st, south Congress, Bat Bridge, Etc. A+"
5,In the Style of a Grand Hotel,"The stately Driskill Hotel provides a well kept and polished glimpse of another time in Austin. With an excellent location for discovering downtown Austin on foot, the Driskill provides service and well appointed rooms. A welcoming lounge and interesting dining options add to a great Texas hotel."
3,Disappointing visit,This was our second visit to this hotel. The first was excellent. This visit was disappointing. The restaurant was closed both nights and staff reaction to requests was mixed. There was no help with baggage on arrival and an upgrade was offered at a much higher price than had been offered by email on the previous day.
5,Upscale charm for girls weekend,My friend and I stayed here for a girls weekend to run the Cap10k. The hotel was beautiful with old style charm. Staff were extremely courteous and made us feel important. It was a little luxury to stay here instead of other basic hotels. I would stay here again!
5,Wonderful stay in downtown Austin,Very impressed with the Driskill. Room was comfortable and very clean. Staff/service was outstanding. Location is great and hotel is generally quiet inside despite the noise on 6th Street. And the hotel offers a nice breakfast spot on-site to boot. Highly recommend.
