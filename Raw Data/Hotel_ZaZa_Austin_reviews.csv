5,"Beautiful property, excellent service","We had booked 2 king rooms for a weekend & were incredibly impressed with the size of the rooms, amenities offered (the morning coffee on each floor was awesome!) & kind service. The hotel bar on the 7th floor has an awesome vibe. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Austin."
2,Such a disappointing experience,"I was very excited to get a chance to finally visit Hotel ZaZa this past weekend since I love all their other properties. Friends and I went to the bar that's located on the 7th floor to enjoy a couple of after dinner cocktails. At the bar, after ordering my martini i mentioned to my friend how the bartender must of forgotten to add the garnish. The bartender overhearing this, very rudely made it a point to embarrass me in front of my friend by telling me that I had ordered something he had never made before and that he would have no way of knowing what I wanted if i didn't tell him. $45 dollars he charged me for one Mexican martini and one mandarin and soda, no automatized receipt was given. As someone who has worked in the industry for over 10 years, I was so disappointed by how this bartender handled and tried to escalate a situation in such an unnecessary manner."
5,Stunning Hotel in the heart of Downtown Austin,"If you are looking to be in the heart of downtown with fabulous service look no further! Everything is top notch from the bars to the pools to the valet service. Rooms are extremely comfortable, would stay here again in a heart beat. Thanks Zaza Austin for an amazing stay!"
5,Rock Star Hotel,"This is a rock star hotel experience from start to finish. Friendly valets make pulling into this hotel a perfect start of our weekend. Upon arrival we were treated to 2 complimentary glasses of good red wine as the front desk checked us in. The lobby is inviting and hoping on a Friday evening. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. There are incredible photos and artwork throughout the hotel that really make this a special experience. Our room had every amenity we needed with very soft and luxurious robes. The bar lounges are happening at this hotel and it’s fun just to people watch as we sipped some great Old Fashions from our table. We had breakfast both days at the hotel that was affordable and delicious. Can’t say enough of all the thought that went into designing this hotel. The staff is incredible and ready to make each guest feel like an actual Rock Star during your stay. They have the little things like a jar of lollipops and hot tamales for the sweet tooth and a butlers pantry with coffee service on your floor that other hotels don’t do. The turn down service that included water bottles, tea candles for ambiance and the chocolate bon bons was a great finishing touch to what was a great nights sleep. This is a special place so we will make this chain our top choice when we come back to Austin or visit other Texas destinations. Outstanding Hotel value with a great staff!"
5,Amazing Hotel,Property is absolutely stunning! Service was on point from the minute we walked in the door until check out. The vibe of the hotel makes you feel like you are in a swanky five star resort in the middle of downtown. Close to hot restaurants and bars if you are looking for fun outside the hotel. If not and you want to dine in their Reuben sandwich is to die for. Will definitely stay here again!
1,Loud!!!,This is the loudest hotel in Austin! I can hear the music in the bar loud and clear! This is not a pleasant place to stay. The staff is not helpful or friendly. The front desk was not accommodating and not friendly during check in. We will be cancelling our reservation for May! Do not stay here unless you want to stay up all night!
5,amazing hotel,"from the rose wine after 4pm, cookies, coffee and tea free every floor, lovely pool, very helpful staff, beautiful rooms, nothing is overlooked, great location.every detail considered. loved the bar and restaurant on the 7 th floor."
5,Amazing check in.,Just flew into Austin for business trip and arrived super early. Elisha was amazing. She got us our 3 rooms within 30 minutes of arrival even after crazy F1 race weekend. Get to the Austin Zaza as fast as you can.
5,"Great Hotel, Even Greater Service.","We decided to hold our team meeting at Hotel ZaZa this past week. I am a huge fan of Hotel ZaZa as we always have had great service. Jessica and the ZaZa team went above and beyond our high expectations. From the room setup, food and beverage selections everyone went above and beyond expectations. And they did all this while getting ready for a big visit that they had the next day.I highly recommend staying at Hotel ZaZa whole in Austin, and if you get a chance to host your team meeting I would do so."
5,Visited spa only,Wow wow wow. The most helpful staff ever and a brilliant facial.The smell of the place absolutely divine. Robes super comfy. Enjoyed the champagne while I check in.I felt the changing area let the rest of the place down. It wasn’t bad but the rest of the place is first class
5,Austin City Limits,"I usually don’t write reviews but this place was awesome. The location was within walking distance or just a short ride from so many bars and restaurants. The staff was very friendly and accommodating any time of day or night from the valet to the manager, Alex. The rooms were very comfortable and the shower felt like you were under a waterfall. Overall I loved this place and can’t wait to come back to Austin. When I do, I’m definitely staying at the ZaZa."
5,Amazing New Hotel,"I recently stayed at Hotel ZaZa downtown Austin and was blown away. This is definitely one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. Beautiful art and a great style through out the hotel, every detail inside and out was truly impressive. The rooftop pool with full bar and dining is a beautiful lookout over the city. On top of the hotel itself, from the doormen all the way to the room service, staff, and service we all so helpful and kind. If you are looking for a true VIP experience in Austin, Hotel Zaza is the place for you!"
5,Amazing,“Valet Director” BASSO rocked our stay at this amazing hotel!!! I felt like We had a personal concierge! He was there for our every need. The hotel was an experience in itself. Absolutely gorgeous! Nice touches and services everywhere. Staff was super and kind. The only negative vibe we got was from sort of a scary guy with a beard named “Drew”. He needs to go. He is not nice and does not fit the mood of the hotel and the relaxed style of the staff. I was hoping he was someone’s personal body guard but I understand he works there. Thanks for an incredible stay Za Za!
5,How do you top your favorite hotel (ZaZa Houston) when they build a new one in Austin? It's tough!,"Ok full disclosure: My favorite hotel on the planet is Hotel ZaZa Houston. I love that place. It's practically my second home. How do you top that? Maybe put one smack dab in the middle of bustling downtown Austin and build it fresh from the ground up??? Let's see how it stacks up against my fav!!!From first arrival, fantastic service, great front desk and concierge. The usual ZaZa amenities such as a breakfast bar, tootsie roll pops and Hot Tamales waiting for you. Lush and comfy lobby area to catch a quick business call. Prince giant artwork in the lobby lets you know this ZaZa is all about the Musica! Love the music vibe in the elevators with Aretha taking you to your floor. Both restaurants were great! Get the one hot chick wrap for lunch and the breakfast tacos for breakfast. Register to be a Zip member and you'll get a charcuterie plate like I did. Turndown service! YES!!! My favorite: Candles, cold water and some yummy chocolate treats your bound to love. My view was amazing. The gym and spa were top notch. You are in downtown Austin with tons of construction hustle/bustle and live music. It's not quiet. But the room was relaxing and very comfortable. Fresh, new and so clean! Wake up early to put your ZaZa slippers, robe on to read your free WSJ and get a coffee and biscotti at the butler station on every floor! Best part when you leave they already digitally check you out! So nice, modern, convenient and luxurious! A++++ Well done Benji and the gang at ZaZa. I love Houston, but your making me fall in love with Austin ZaZa."
5,Great New Hotel,"We've stayed at this hotel twice. The first time was in September. The second was in October. On the first stay, there were some issues. Honestly, we might not have come back again after that, but an operations manager named Jade did her very best to make up for those problems. It was because of the professionalism and responsiveness of Jade that we decided to give the hotel a second try, and I am very glad that we did. On this second stay, everything was perfect. We could not have been happier with the service and the room. We look forward to coming back on our next visit to Austin."
5,Group Therapy,"We had a dinner reservation nearby and decided to go to group therapy to try out the new bar. The bar and service was amazing. The bartender pours a very generous glass of wine. At first I thought it was pricey, but the drink glass and size is a steal. We regretted keeping our reservation near by, we should have stayed at group therapy! We will definitely be back."
5,ZaZa ATX Opening,"Finally, after the long anticipated wait, ZaZa opened in ATX. Myself and a client had the opportunity to stay on property opening night! This hotel will be the GEM of downtown ATX! Was super pleased to see that Alex is manning the ship as he was visible everywhere that evening.My overnight travels to Houston and Dallas always include a home away from home stay at a ZaZa property. Excited to have this property online and look forward to the many nights ahead that I have a home away from home in ATX!"
5,Best hotel in Austin,I recently stayed at the brand new Hotel Zaza in Austin and was blown away with the luxurious space. The room was immaculate and the food/drink at Perfect Strangers was amazing. I travel for business often and will only stay at Hotel Zaza when in Austin. Staff was amazing as well.
5,Best Hotelin Austin,What an epic experience from the front door to check in all the way to the fabulous bars/ restaurants! My new favorite hotel in Austin! Cannot day enough good things about the hospitality and the little details they cover! Will be back again!
5,Favorite hotel in Austin!,"I recently visited Hotel ZaZa in downtown Austin and I absolutely fell in love! I have been to all the other ZaZa’s, but this one takes the cake! One reason that I visit is because of the GM Alex! He is very friendly, accommodating and makes sure to make me feel welcomed at all times! He is THE BEST and goes above and beyond! I will no longer stay in any hotel other than ZaZa in Austin!"
5,New favorite hotel in Austin,The new Zaza hotel in Austin has the same welcoming feel as all the other locations. The pool has an amazing view of the city and the rooms are bigger and nicer than before. Will not stay anywhere else in Austin
5,Brand new Zaza for Austin,"We regularly visit Zaza in Dallas and Houston and everything is over-the-top awesome each time. They have only been open for 2 weeks, so they are just getting up to speed. We were there for a conference and this hotel is slightly smaller the their others. I think we overwhelmed them a bit as about 350 attendees was a lot for the size of their meeting facilites, especially at lunch. Their pool is somewhat small with no hot tub. The decor on our floor and our room were not as amazingly funky cool as the other hotels, but still very Zaza. The service was over-the-top great as always at Zaza and they are always accomodating. Be advised that valet parking is $50 buck a nite."
5,ZaZa Zoom,"I have Marriott Lifetime Platinum status, but wanted something more unique & elegant with a reasonable price for an anniversary trip to Austin. Hotel ZaZa was the perfect choice!! Savannah was very welcoming at the front desk & acknowledged our anniversary. I had booked the standard king room, but was nicely surprised to find an upgrade to king corner suite. Decor is gorgeous, felt like I was in a British gentlemen's club including the persian rug. We had cocktails at the rooftop pool area, which has multiple shaded couch seating areas, as well as sunny spaces if you wish. A bottle of Proseco & chocolate-covered strawberries were waiting in the suite when we returned. Also enjoyed the most luxurious robe I've ever worn. Would definitely stay again."
5,My new “Go-to” hotel in Austin,"W and JW beware, this is the new hotel on the block and they are brand spanking new with a superior product offering. I predict the W will lose lot of business and they will be forced to refurbish as this hotel is a direct competitive threat. The great thing is that the Zaza will offers more capacity in the Austin premium hotel market and hopefully add downward pressure on rates during busy weekends.Overall the Zaza offers a great product and the bed was comfy, and the bathroom with stand up shower was fantastic. I enjoyed the pool area complete with pool side bar and predict that this will be a hot fixture during the summer months. I’ll definitely be back soon..."
5,Amazing weekend at Zaza!!,Great stay at the new Austin Zaza the hotel is very modern chic each area of the hotel has its own unique decor which makes the hotel super interesting the food was great the lamb was delicious drinks were great the staff is so friendly and helpful I’ve stayed here twice already and each room is different and creative it has a great location downtown and they provide car services if you decide to go out on the town a great place to stay beautiful views a great place to enjoy Austin.
5,Amazing Celebration,We had the best experience celebrating our friend Joe James’ Birthday at Hotel ZaZa. Alex and his team went above and beyond to ensure it was a one of a kind night. The food was amazing and their bar was on point. We cannot wait to go back!
5,Fun dinner with friends at Hotel Zaza!,Thank you to Alex and his amazing staff at the new Hotel Zaza for a great birthday celebration for my husband (Joe James Camarillo)! We had a lovely dinner at Perfect Strangers and then went up to the Group Therapy on the 7th floor to listen to live music. Cocktails were on point and the service was great! Large in part what makes the Zaza amazing is the attention to detail starting with the valet and carrying through to the waitstaff and bar. Great ambience too! High recommended.
5,Beautiful hotel in great location,"We stayed at Hotel Zaza for 4 nights a couple weeks after it opened. Overall, we had a great stay and would stay here again. The hotel is beautiful and located within walking distance to a lot of fun spots. They were still putting some finishing touches on the hotel during our stay, but it didn't detract from our experience. The staff was very helpful and wanted to ensure we had a great experience. The hotel pool was also very enjoyable and worth spending at least a couple hours at each day. The gym is brand new and definitely above average when it comes to hotel gyms. We're looking forward to another visit to Zaza in the near future."
5,Football weekend trip,This ZaZa property just opened. So is very nice and clean. The bar and restaurant were nice. Rooms were nice. Service had a few kinks but not bad for just opening. A gentleman named Alex was very helpful to us and outstanding. Looking forward to coming back.
4,Brand New Zaza,"My mother and I were excited to stay here after many great stays at the Houston museum district Zaza. Lots of valet and friendly front desk staff made check-in quick. Wine and delicious cookies offered in the lobby. Got to our room - it was not finished (just bed frames and half tiled bathroom), so we called down and Jade the manager came right up and took us to a new room. We had chosen a double king because they have bathtubs. New balcony room didn't have one. Jade offered to try and find a room with tub but I didn't want to be a pain. Room and bathroom were large and had everything you'd want except maybe a coffee maker (though there's a coffee station by the elevator in the am). Very comfy beds, and turndown service with candle and truffles is nice. Main restaurant hasn't opened yet so we ate at the poolside area of the lounge. Young crowd and fun vibe. The menu is very much the same as in Houston. We had really good steaks. A few nitpicky things - our room had no price list for the mini bar and no ""do not disturb"" sign so housekeeping tried to come in twice. Someone came thinking we had ordered ice (you have to call for it - no machines) which turned out to be for nextdoor. The girl who brought room service spoke no English, so there was a little confusion where they called later wanting to know what additional items we were asking for (none). Went down in am to review the bill, and breakfast was on there but not previous night's dinner. Our stay was a package which included valet (normally $45), $40 breakfast credit, and 2 cocktails which we didn't use. In Houston, ZIP loyalty members get a $25 dining credit on top of any package deals (and the unused cocktails would've been credited too) but they said they don't do it that way. Overall it was a nice stay in a good downtown location and felt like the staff is eager to please but just needs a little time to work out a few kinks."
