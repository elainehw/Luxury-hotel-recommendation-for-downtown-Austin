5,Trendy and comfy hotel,"Stayed here for a conference down the street at the Fairmont. I am glad I stayed here so I could have some down time from work while the Fairmont is just 3-minute walk away.The hotel is decorated with a music motif and the rooms are decent size despite being a boutique hotel. The property is kept very clean and new.The staff ranging from reception, concierge, bell desk and doormen were all extremely helpful and hospitable. My luggage was delayed and I also had packages arriving for me. Sean and Ray both ensured that they were promptly delivered to my room.I booked my stay through a hotels.com and my booking included breakfast. The hotel gave me a USD50 credit for food and beverage per day. I used it for breakfast or lunch on different days. I appreciated the flexibility.The food was also excellent. The restaurant was on the 4th floor.If I come to Austin again, I would certainly stay here again. There are plenty of restaurant choices about a 15-minute walk away at 6th Street and Congress, or it was a 5-10 minute walk from the convention center."
1,You won’t sleep,"We decided on this hotel as it was away from the rowdy part of town (6th street). We checked in after 20 hours of travelling, went out for a meal and were back in the hotel for an early night before a day of sight seeing the following day. We were on the 5th floor and at 10:30pm music started from the hotel bar below. The hotel provide earplugs in the bedside draw, however the room was vibrating as there was a rock band on and the drums were so loud and intense it made it impossible to sleep. I called and asked if music would be on the following night, and was told it wouldn’t be. This meant there was no need for me to ask to switch rooms. The following night after a day of sightseeing and drinks we were back in the room for 9pm due to a 7am start to get back on the road. At 9:30pm music started again, even though I had been told there would be no live music!!! We missed our alarm as we were so tired so were late leaving the following day. We paid a lot of money to stay at this hotel for 2 nights, expecting a quality experience and good sleep, it was a complete waste. They leave a note in your room to explain you’re in the “music capital of the world”! That might be true, but the noise from Rainey Street was no problem at all. However, if you charge the prices you charge, I suggest investing in sound proofing your bar! Let down for a Kimpton hotel. Would not recommend, you may as well stay closer to 6th street, you’d get a better sleep!One positive....Clarence one of the hotel door staff was absolutely fantastic. So helpful with directions and advice on the area, very interesting man and an asset to the hotel. Every hotel should have a Clarence!"
4,Fantastic stay for F1,"From the second we were warmly greeted at check-in by the fantastic Kara this stay was everything we had hoped and more.The hotel is modern and extremely well situated, right in the heart of bustling and youthful Rainey Street and a short 15 minute walk from the more traditional 6th Street.Internally Geraldine's on the 4th floor is chic, with a decent selection of drinks and excellent food - one night we couldn't decide what to have individually so we simply ordered one of everything and ate a la banquet.There is also live music every night in Geraldine's and I didn't hear a bad act in the 9 nights I stayed there.Happy Hour should last longer than 5-6pm daily is my only criticism, especially when the F1 is on and it's very difficult to get back from the race track in time.Great stay, I'll be backMike ScalesIHG Spire Ambassador Member"
5,Very trendy modern hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel for anyone who is young, trendy and looking to go out on Rainey street.It’s just behind Rainey’s many bars, clubs and restaurants, so if you are planning to party hard but then retreat to a luxurious and modern hotel at the end of the night - the Kimpton will be perfect for you!The lobby is very funky and on check in you can get a free watermelon cider - very hipster.But all staff is very friendly and efficient and our room was even ready early.We had some French champagne and chocolate strawberries waiting for us in our room as we were travelling for our anniversary - lovely touch!We also got upgraded to a river view room - very nice!The room was spacious, very clean and surprisingly quiet despite being just above the pool deck.They must have good sound proofing which is great if you have a room above Rainey street, especially on a weekend. (Live music everywhere!)The pool deck is the place to be, all the hot young people hang out there.Definitely not a place for older people, but we aren’t huge partiers and still really enjoyed it.Would definitely recommend this hotel."
3,"Trendy hotel, but tired room","We had pretty high expectations for such a well reviewed hotel of this class. First impressions of customer service, valet, and lobby were really great. Learned about an upgrade at check-in, which was very welcome, but the upper floor room seemed like it had barely survived a party and being my first Kimpton stay, was not a good representation of its advertised brand (see pics). It was a room with a great view, though!Walls were scuffed, lamp shades dented, stains on the curtains, and less than functional bathroom door. If this hadn’t been a rewards stay, I would have complained more vocally.The mattress was average, which we also found disappointing, for a hotel at this price point. I’ll admit, We’re spoiled at home with a very comfortable mattress so it’s rare to be impressed in this category.They did serve excellent coffee in the ground floor cafe, probably the most flavorful coffee I’ve had of any hotel stay.We also really appreciated the happy hour, where it was quite busy in a vibrant, comfortable atmosphere."
5,Great location,"Lovely, very large boutique hotel with a stellar location. The views from the upper floors are fabulous. The service from top to bottom also fabulous. The happy hour with free margaritas and wine a very nice touch. The cafe on first floor was GREAT. (Though it would have been nice to have free coffee in room.) A little pricey- but that's Austin for ya.The pillows and mattresses (bed comfort) A +."
5,"Location, Boutique & Beauty","Another area we must recommend when visiting Austin, TX is Rainey Street district. A little historic neighborhood with small houses that have been converted into mini bars and restaurants. Right in the heart of all of them is this magnificent hotel with incredible views, a fine bar and restaurant... but, overall a great Austin vibe clearly in the spirit of live music and entertainment. It has a rustic feel, but we assure you everything is modern and clean :)"
5,Wowza!,"My teen daughter and I were in Austin for the first time to see 'Hamilton' and stayed here on points. We arrived a little early and our room was ready, they upgraded us to a suite on a high floor without even asking! I was offered a local beer upon check in. The lobby is fabulous. We opened the door to the room and wow! Our room was facing the Fairmont and a construction site crane but the room itself was the view. One of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. We had a soaking tub and didn't have time to use it. The decor was a lovely blend of modern and antique, with leather furniture and even a yoga mat in the closet. Good sleeping, it was quiet. (We were probably the late to get back in noisy guests) If you need a wine opener, look no further than the drawer close to mini fridge. They thought of everything. This was our first Kimpton, hopefully not our last. They also gave us a late check out of 12:00 when we returned late from the show. Restaurant was really neat with friendly employees though food was pricey and not that great for breakfast. It was convenient, though. Doormen were awesome, friendly and funny. Such a great experience. Do this if you can!"
5,Stellar Hotel,"Sorry for the late review. Stayed here in the summer of 2019 and enjoy my first visit to Austin immensely. Kimpton Van Zandt is the perfect hotel and a cool and vibrant city. You’ll forget that you’re in Texas. The staff all around was very friendly and accommodating. Location is good, near a lot of food trucks and hip bars. Downtown Austin, proper, is a good walk or short bike/scooter ride away. I can’t wait to visit again, the pictures say it all!"
5,Unique Property,"Van Zandt has a unique location, close to a row of pop-up restaurants and bars. The hotel is modern and has a great vibe. The pool area is a popular spot and the second floor restaurant has live music, for breakfast too."
5,Anniversary weekend,"Such a wonderful and nice hotel. The staff is helpful, nice and accommodating. The entire hotel has the best decor, colors and tones. Walking distance to bars, restaurants and Austin's downtown. Love the views the comfortable beds and the food is outstanding."
5,Attentive Staff,"Nice hotel! The HVZ staff was very accommodating and attentive. Trish, our poolside server, did an excellent job taking care of our large group of 12 while we occupied the large cabana next to the pool! Alyssa was also very helpful coordinating a late check-out. The bar and restaurant is very nice and had live music over the weekend, which was a nice surprise. We enjoyed our stay!"
5,ACL Festival,Wonderful hotel with excellent service and amenities. On arrival Joe was very helpful in rearranging some rooms for me. The hotel is beautiful next to Rainey Street. Whoever designed the walk-in shower finally got it right by putting the shower head at one end and the shower turner on er or whatever u call it on the other so u don’t freeze or scald ur toolie off when getting in. Had a great stay.
5,Excellent weekend from location to staff to physical spaces,3 of us came on a girls trip in honor of 50th bdays. The hotel greeted us and embraced us - we loved being at the pool. the double queen corner room gave us great space. we loved coffee in the morning and happy hour at 5 all gratis. Location was walking to Rainey street and downtown restaurants also close to so co and the bat bridge. We loved closing out each night at Geraldines The vibe and bands were great better for our age group than the locations on Rainey (mostly)
2,Great location but greatly understaffed,"You defiantly can not be the location and the sunset by the pool is great, my main problem is it is greatly understaffed. I spent 5 nights here in September and while the staff tried there best to help us out they felt overworked cause its understaffed. The check in process was far too long and I ended up getting the wrong room that I booked. I finally got to my room and It was dirty. You pay a premium to stay here and the hallways are very dirty and stink, room service treys are left out for hours. Its also one of those places where it takes to long to get a drink at the pool bar and restaurant bar. I really wanted to like this place but I just won't be back the price and service don't match. Please hire more people"
4,"Hip vibe, great location","We stayed at the Hotel Van Zandt for two nights, with a room on the 13th floor facing the river, looking down at the pool. We enjoyed the experience. Friendly, competent staff, from the classic Austin gentleman greeting people at the front door to the front desk associate who checked us in and went to fetch us free drinks during happy hour. Great first impression! The hotel is well located next to Rainey Street and you can get to many attractions within 10 minutes. Don't rent a car -- use Uber/Lyft, it's cheaper and no stress. We enjoyed dining at Geraldine's twice, once with a large group for dinner (small plates, pretty expensive, adds up before you know it!) and the next morning for brunch with live music. The people staying there on this football weekend were diverse -- a sea of UT Austin T-shirts on people of all ages, plus two weddings. The coffee shop downstairs serves free coffee and decent breakfast tacos/muffins/yogurt (not free). The room was a bit on the small side and the bathroom barn door for the toilet was very heavy, hard to move. You can hear noise in the hallway and even noise in the pool area 13 flights down. So ask for a room on an upper floor, away from Rainey Street. We would go there again."
4,Great location!,"The hotel is located in the best spot for visiting Rainey Street. It is very nicely decorated. The pool, bar and restaurant are good. One big disappointment is NO in room coffee. I would rather have coffee than a mini bar. Parking is $45 plus a night."
5,Perfect Location for this Boutique Hotel,We stayed at the Van Zandt as part of a wedding party. Everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful! I recommend a higher floor to get away from the noise of Rainey Street.The coffee shop in the lobby and the hotel restaurant (Geraldines) were wonderful! You'll find something to satisfy every taste.We hung out at the pool bar one night - one word of warning - the Verde Mule is VERY spicy! But it is a great vantage point for watching the Congress Avenue Bridge Bats!The bed was very comfortable and the room layout contained lots of drawer and closet space. Great views of downtown Austin from our room.You can walk everywhere and it was easy to get an Uber. We did not rent a car so I can't speak to parking.I would stay here again on another trip to Austin.
4,I’ll be Back,"Situated in a good location in downtown Austin the Dog friendly Kimpton Hotel offers plenty of ambience. The hotel is named after country singer Tommy Van Zandt and the lobby decor has a music theme with the stunning chandeliers shaped like musical horns. There is a turntable they spin LPs on during the happy hour in the lobby. From 5-6 guests are treated to wine, daiquiris and light apps, a Kimpton tradition.The service is excellent and you will periodically receive a text from a staff member inquiring about your stay. It was our anniversary and we received a bottle of sparkling wine along with chocolate covered strawberries...nice touch.The restaurant is good. We enjoyed the Sunday jazz brunch. The bar is nice, servers are both knowledgeable and friendly and the drink menu is creative. Almost forgot, live music most nights.The location is walkable to the action on 6th Street. Rainey Street is just a block over and filled with restaurants, bars, food trucks and live music. Many of the establishments there were previously homes now converted.The one downside to the hotel is noise. One of the bars on Rainey plays loud music which can be heard in some of the rooms. Also there is a building under construction which makes for a lot of noise. Not what I was expecting at 8:00 AM on a Saturday. Won’t be getting a room on the same side next time.Would have awarded 5 stars were it not for the noise."
4,Friendly en classy,This is a very nice Hotel. There's a lot of staff and they're all very friendly. The rooms are spacious and clean. It can be a bit noisy at night because of all the live music in Austin. The pool is beautiful and the overall impression of the hotel is hip and classy
3,Posh Venue; Parking and Traffic Control Awful,"Attended a fund raiser / non-profit event. Beautiful hotel. Modern, fresh design. That’s inside. Outside is a disaster. Long lines to park, long lines for Uber drop off and pick up, 25 minutes or more to get a car from the valet (according g to my wife, who drive and I took an Uber).And, as was true in the past at this event, food very meh; very ordinary tasting, although nice looking presentation.If you like glitz and glamour, you’ll like this place. Once you actually get there and get inside. Otherwise, go elsewhere in my opinion."
5,Awesome experience,"Amazing feel from the moment we checked in until we checked out. Top notch service and staff. Very accommodating. Gave me a quiet room as requested with earplugs. Attended a family wedding at the hotel and loved everything.. the Pool, the gym, the happy hour, everything."
5,An amazing quick weekend getaway,"I don't normally write reviews, actually its my first on trip advisor! I must first thank Pao at the front desk for accommodating us with all our needs as we were traveling with a new born and 5 year old kid! She got us a fridge for babymilk, a crib and upgraded our rooms as we are hyatt platinum card holders! We were welcome with drinks for happy hour which was a surprise, it felt like we were on a resort but it was in Austin! I know some parents complain of noise at night but I didnt hear much noise, I did hear a little music but I think that stop at 2AM. However, that did not disturb me and the family from sleeping. Also, I am from New York so, I am use to Noise! Breakfast was amazing! Must try and piano playing the background. The pool is amazing is as well! The only improvement is lowering the parking fee!"
5,Modern and beautiful hotel,"Great place to stay in Austin. In the heart of the action. The hotel restaurant is a must. Very good. Pool area was crowded, but expected on a hot day. Free margaritas and snacks everyday in the afternoon. Who could ask for more? I recommend this hotel."
4,Birthday weekend getaway,"If you wanna be literally next and close to the best spots in Austin Texas this is the place to be: GREAT location!On a different note tho I went with my boyfriend to celebrate my bday weekend and to also relax and get away from routine... probably not the best place to do so. Room was overall pretty nice, great view; lobby and 4th floor was also very nice, pool area tho: super overrated in my opinion. It is so packed and loud you can hardly enjoy, unless you are in the mood for a handful of bachelorettes that take the whole area. Prices for drinks and food also pretty high compared to all the places close by where you can go and enjoy a drink or a good meal for a much better price.The scooter situation makes it very nice to get around tho.I had a lot of fun!"
5,Awesome vibe and great location,"Loved, loved, loved this hotel! This hotel had such a great vibe. Modern but very comfortable. Service was great at both check in and check out as well as the bar, restaurant and coffee shop. We loved the live music at Geraldine's and the outdoor deck/pool was beautiful! The location is great and just around the corner there are cute restaurants, bars and food trucks. We will definitely be back and hopefully for a longer stay to check out more of Austin."
2,Charges and NickThinks (and Nickel-Dimes) like a Four Seasons but my experience was more Motel 6,"To my fellow TripAdvisor reviewers, I love you, you’ve steered me to so many great places but when it comes to this hotel…What the heck were you thinking?Positives :1. Audrey? at check-in was very friendly and greeted us more than once with a genuine smile. We also got to the hotel 5 hours before check-in and after a short wait were given a room. Very nice. One caveat - they charge your credit card 100.00 dollars per day for incidentals and then refund what you don’t use. That seemed excessive to me.2. Housekeeping was good and consistent. Never came back to an untidy room.Additionally lights on table lamps and bathroom light had dimmers which was nice.3. Evening reception hour with beer and margaritas was good and they do it on the weekends as well.Negatives :They started right away :1. The elevator required a room key to scan before you could select your floor. This system was terrible and more than half the time it didn’t work on the first try. On one occasion I scanned the card (it blinked green) and the elevator stopped 6 floors above my floor. Numerous other guests had issues not just myself.2. Getting off the elevator on floor 6 at noon my wife and I thought we had mistakenly selected “dungeon” on the elevator. It was VERY, VERY dark (Creepy!) with a musty smell.3. Arriving at my room it appeared clean and satisfactory. I like to keep my hotel room cool (69°). Upon entering the thermostat was set to 65°, the room temp read 73° and it felt warmer. I tried to turn it down but 65 was as low as it would go. I called the front desk and asked if someone could check it and their response was we’ll have someone check it but when it gets real hot in the heat of the day it might not be able maintain the desired temperature. What? Come again? After about 2 hours maintenance did show up and replaced the AC filter (which was completely clogged) after this room temp was significantly better but never got as cool as I liked or set the thermostat to.4. This is mostly on me but when I went to connect to the internet I found its 13.00 dollars a day for 3 devices max. I’ve stayed at many upscale hotels and I realize many charge for internet but this place certainly didn’t live up to being in their league.5. Next I was thirsty and wanted a soda. Any vending machines in the entire hotel? No. But they’ll be happy to sell you an 8.5 ounce Diet Coke for 3.50 cents (4 for 14.00 dollars actually) Thats basically 5 bucks for a 12 oz soda. Come on! Too make matters worse they know they’ve got you because there are no convenience stores anywhere near the hotel.6. Don’t expect to relax and float around in the pool. (See picture from our room on a Saturday afternoon)7. Lots of other minor annoyances :a) channel selection on the TV was poor. I’ve had muchbetter at hotels that were half the cost.b) Clock in the room was 25 mins slow.c) Parking is well over 50.00 dollars a day with tax. Again Kimpton thinks it’s a four seasons in the heart of a major metropolis - sorry guys- you aren’t!d) Constant annoying throbbing noise outside our room window both night and day (It didn’t seem like a drumbeat) never could figure out what it was or were it was coming from.So Kimpton Van Zandt thinks (and charges) like it’s an upscale hotel but doesn’t deliver even close to that type of experience. It’s the biggest nickel/dime hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Don’t get the good reviews. Absolutely would never return."
5,Great vibe and service,"We spent 3 nights here and loved it!The hotel has a great vibe and the service was excellent, down to the finer details. The rooms were very spacious and the hotel offer a social drink in the afternoon, which was a fantastic way to meet other guests. The margaritas were also fabulous.The pool was very busy due to the heat but their were always sun beds available.Location was good with a short walk to downtown, Rainey Street which was full of bars / restaurants. Also walkable to Congress Bridge to see the bats and then onto SoCo.Can’t fault and would look for Kimpton hotels in other cities."
4,Great weekend get away,The location and Hotel was a perfect place to hang out the entire weekend. The live music and happy hour was a pleasant surprise. The rooftop pool was also nice. The rooms were spacious and luxurious. Highly recommend! The pay to park was the only downside to staying here.
4,Weekend get away,"The hotel is lovely, the doorman greats very one; it is right next to Rainey Street which is very popular, so you can walk and not have to worry about finding a parking spot or drinking after enjoying an adult beverage or two. The pool was also very nice with an outdoor bar. Will stay here again when in town."
5,Awesome hotel and location,"Austin is such a great city. It’s also pretty expensive. The Van Zandt is no exception. Having said that, it does deliver on a relaxing and more than comfortable experience. The staff is accommodating and appropriately friendly. The rooms are outstanding-fairly good size. This trip I was upgraded to a suite—and that was sweet! The beds are beyond comfortable. The bathrooms are well appointed and they don’t skimp on towels or washcloths. The shower is fabulous! Am in room yoga mat made my inner yogi so happy! The pool area is awesome. They provide generous towels and sunscreen along with full bar and food menu. Also poolside water is easily accessible. The location makes it easy to get almost anywhere. I didn’t have a car, but understand that’s pretty pricey. This is my second time here and I know there will be a third...and more!"
4,"A nice hotel, but not the most family-friendly.","The hotel itself is lovely, new, modern, well-designed. The customer service at the hotel is also great. Unfortunately, we were not prepared for the clientele staying there. Mostly young partying crowd, as it's in a loud neighborhood with lots of bars and music venues. We felt out of place with our five-year-old in tow. The first night, a Saturday, the pool was chock full, playing loud music until very late (heard it from the 12th floor) and we were woken up in the middle of the night with kids partying in our hall. It calmed down a bit after that but by the afternoon each day, the pool was full of young drinking adults and again, not really a place for a young child."
5,SIOUXper Woman!,"I have two clients whose flights were cancelled tonight and I called to see if the Van Zandt can help reinstate there reservations that they checked out of earlier today. Rooms were rather scarce but after speaking with her supervisor, they were able to get rooms for both of my clients.Sioux was very professional and was very helpful with the changes. Thank you Sioux for helping my clients out and the Kimpton Van Zandt is lucky to have you! (Give this hero a raise!)"
4,The common areas are better than the rooms themselves,"I am really impressed how beautiful the pool area, lobby, and gym are. I mean, there's a fireplace next to a pool and a Pelaton bike in the gym. Yes!! The room itself, is another story. I had expectations for the rooms to be gorgeous, especially since this was once voted the best hotel in the city. I was disappointed when it turned out to be a barely above basic room. The amenities available are great, but for the price point I would've hoped to have a nicer room.Pro Tip: Parking on the property is $50+. Only do this if you have that extra money and really don't want to spend and extra 10 minutes driving around to look for extra parking. If you want to save, download the Park ATX app and park at one of the indicated lots/streets. There are so many next to this hotel. We didn't spend more than $6 for an entire day of parking and didn't have to walk more than 2 minutes to get to our parking spot from the hotel."
5,Great stay in Austin,"The service at this hotel was impeccable. I can usually find something to complain about but either my therapy is finally working or the service really was that good. They let us check in FOUR HOURS early for free (unheard of!). They had great valet service - our car was around within 5 minutes of texting the valet every time. And honestly - thank god for valet texting. I'm a millennial and if I had to call, my car would still be there, feel me?I was traveling with two little tornados/children and one of them lost her ever-loving mind somewhere between voodoo donuts and the hotel. Sugar crash or demon possession? Jury's still out. Anyway, she was screaming and a hotel employee rushed up to us as we were about to get on the elevator. I thought he was going to shush her or kick us out or something but he pulled out two plush toys and tried to cheer her up. She was a jerk to him but it was just the kindest gesture.The restaurant had quick service and good food. Pool was hopping and still fun for kiddos. Everything was spotless, nothing was broken or in disrepair. The location is great, we were steps from Lainey St with tons of nightlife and food options. Our room was quiet and exactly what we needed with two little ones. Usually I like to try out different hotels/resorts when I visit the same town twice, but I'll tell you there's no chance for that in Austin. Kimpton has my business. Also, you guys hiring? Call me. But only if I get to stay there while I interview ;-)"
3,"Cool hotel but bit loud, no room at the pool and wifi that is charged!","So this is a cool hotel, staff very good and welcoming on arrival with a free water or can of beer. Room was of a very good size and very nicely done. Bed comfy, sheets lovely. Hotel is well located near Rainy Street but as others say can be a bit loud, not due to Rainy street for us but the live music in Geraldine's which was still keeping me up at 11.30pm. We did actually take brunch at Geraldine's and really enjoyed it but not when wanting sleep! I do have a real beef though about NO free wifi, what hotel in this day & age doesn't give free wifi? I think it was $12.99 per day but couldn't tell how many devices that was for and was annoyed so refused to pay! The other pain was the pool area as small for the size of the hotel. We arrived at 3pm and no beds at all and many people lying on towels on concrete around the pool, same the next day as we'd gone for a walk in the morning. All beds were taken early doors when the pool in the shade, awaiting the for the sun to come round. Overall I liked the hotel, perhaps I'm a little old?!"
1,SO LOUD-Vegas in the south,"While it’s a beautiful hotel, don’t stay here unless you are in your twenties looking to party. It’s 11:22 pm and I’m on the 14th floor but can hear the club across the street loud and clear. My sister has it worse with her 2 young children on the 5th floor. They can’t move her until tomorrow because the hotel is full so they offered a white noise machine. We booked 3 rooms for 2 nights, but I’d leave tonight if I could. Such a disappointment. The pool looked like a pool party in Vegas and the all night partying is the cherry on top. So much for a fun visit to Austin. Counting down the minutes until we can leave."
5,Cool Austin Vibes,"What a cool hotel on Rainey Street in Austin. This vibrant area of Austin is full of food and music, and the Hotel Van Zandt is perfectly situated and decorated for the scene. Upon entering, you immediately see the amazing trumpet chandeliers hanging in the lobby. There is also a totally cool record player that plays vinyls during happy hour in the lobby. Happy hour includes margaritas in these parts!We were greeted at the front desk and offered a water or beer while checking in - nice touch!! Everyone was so helpful and had really cool uniforms - nothing old and stuffy.The rooms are nice and very modern. My only complaint would be the bed frame with sharp corners. If you are on the far side of the bed, be careful in the night not to bang your leg on the frame. Could I suggest some padding on the corners? Otherwise, it was perfection.Thank you for a wonderful stay. We can’t wait to come back!"
2,Worst Views,I got the pricier room that is supposed to overlook the river when the fireworks were held on 7/4 and on the other side of the room overlooks a city view. The city view consisted of a big hole where a new building was being built (not the hotel's fault) and the river view was a horrible mess of dirt and debris strewn everywhere and several construction vehicles. When i looked to my immediate left there was a big cement wall outside the window. They're dog friendly which was great but there is nowhere for dogs to use the bathroom. When I called the front desk to ask they told me to walk my dog outside along one of the trails. I'm not familiar with any of the trails and it was dark outside.
5,"Great service, well appointed hotel","We were a little nervous booking this hotel with three young kids in tow (including twin toddlers) but our concerns were immediately alleviated upon arrival when a wagon appeared with toys for kids to select from. There was a mix up with our request for two cribs but once finally remedied at 10:30pm we were given room credit as an apology, which was a lovely gesture. Two cribs fitted easily into our double room.All staff were friendly and helpful throughout our three nights stay and this extended to the pool area. Although other reviewers felt it might not be suitable for young kids we were made to feel very welcome by all staff and guests! There was some music noise in the evenings which we could hear from our room but nothing that kept any of us awake and it didn’t go on late. All in, we had a fantastic stay (and the happy hour was a huge hit)! We will be back."
5,Top Notch/ Great locale/ Impeccable Service,"This is my favorite hotel in Austin. Besides the modern decor, attention to detail and great service; the word on the street is that they also give back to the community. While I’m not from Austin, this speaks to me. We had amazing service and a spectacular room. We will def be back!"
5,Pool Vibes,"I was so impressed by this hotel I had to return. The hotel has style points to burn. Down to the last detail, every area of the hotel is gorgeous. To highlight, the pool was awesome! Staff was extremely nice and took great care of the patrons. The music was chill enough to have conversations but enough tempo to keep the vibes like a day club. Think One Hotel in Miami meets the Cosmopolitan Boulevard Pool in Vegas. Can’t wait to bring my friends to Austin and experience this hotel again."
5,Thank you so much for the late check out!,"First let me say how grateful I am for the super easy late check out . This is a huge deal for me and why I rate this trip/hotel 5 stars. Other really solid points.... great service at Geraldine’s, amazing location near to stellar local color/ music and exceptional vibe.Now for my personal sticking points. There’s are items important to me but may not be for someone else.1. Dark bathrooms. Dark to the point that makeup cannot be applied. The standard make up mirror provided is not lighted. The guest service rep that contacted me regarding the enjoyment level of my stay said she could provide a lighted mirror, but one never materialized.2. The pillows are too stiff and do not allow for the flexibility of adjustment for comfort. Again, feather pillows were offered by the guest service rep, but they were never provided. Housekeeping did manager to track a couple down though.3. The bathrooms are too small for 2 people to be at the countertop and there is only one sink.4. I could not get the room cold enough to sleep in. I wondered if it was just our room, but aFriend staying on another floor mentioned the same problem."
4,Great location near Rainey Street,"I stayed at this hotel as it was the selected hotel I was in town for a wedding for (although the wedding was held at a different venue). I felt that the price was pretty steep for wedding accommodations, but unfortunately Austin is a very popular destination and they're right in line with the other hotels in the area. Overall my stay was OK - not terrible, but I did have a few complaints.The room itself was average, decent bed and nice toiletries. There were several outlets so that was good. My biggest frustration was the lack of housekeeping services. In my opinion, the major reason to stay at a hotel over an AirBnB is for the daily maid service. Our first day, I was out of the room until about 3 PM and it was never cleaned. No one came by until about 4:30, at which point I was getting ready for the wedding so I needed use of the room. I called and had fresh towels brought up instead. Again the next day, no maid service until the late afternoon. I understand it was a busy weekend with high turnover, but I'm used to maids starting to knock around 8 AM. If I'm out of the room from 8-3, I expect the room to have been cleaned in that time.My next complaint was that there aren't enough lounges at the pool. Its a 16-story hotel, you need more than 30 lounges in the summer. Pool security is nice to have, but I also need a place to sit outside of the sun and if you got to the pool after 11 forget finding a lounge or anywhere in the shade.The food at the restaurant is good and fairly priced, but I thought some of the cocktails were a little high.Overall, I would stay there again do to the excellent location. However, I felt that I was getting 3-star service for a 4-star price."
4,Good location near Rainey area,"Hotel is right next to Rainey. Right now there is construction on both the north and west sides of the hotel, but I was not bothered by any noise. No coffee service in the room. Good exercise room with Precor equipment (but the Open stride machine needs maintenance). They even had a Peloton stationery bike. No floor pads to do stretching on. Would I go back again ... yes, I like Kimpton hotels."
5,Loved it,Loved this hotel!! After one night decided to extend my stay because it was exactly what we’ve been looking for. After a long day checkin at the front with Will was a breeze and the breakfast at Grimaldi’s is amazing 😀
4,Great time in Austin,"Beautiful modern hotel. Great service from the front desk staff.Stayed in a king deluxe room. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious. Mattress was comfy but the pillows aren't. The bathroom is pretty. Good water pressure but minimal lighting. The toiletries are good quality and plenty of towels are provided. So not the best if you enjoy wearing makeup.Unfortunately, I stayed across from one of the supply closets and housekeeping was very loud.Pool is nice with great views. The restaurant is decent. Nothing special nothing bad. But the staff was lovely.Rainey Street, right behind the hotel, is full of bars and restaurants. Great for listening to music, mingling, eating, and drinking. But it's loud and the live music is really loud. If resting or going to bed early is part of your plan I don't recommend staying here.Cafe 605, on the main floor, adjacent to the lobby is spacious. Good place to have a drink, cool off, grab a quick snack, and just relax.Closet was big with plenty of drawers. Yoga mat is provided which was a nice benefit.Overall, a great choice."
5,Total Pleasure,"My husband and I stayed at a Kimpton in 2018 for the first time. It was a fantastic experience. When we had a reason to stay at another, we jumped at it. The first one, in 2018 was in Phoenix, AZ and the most recent was in Austin, TX. We were as happy with the second experience as the first. These are fantastic hotels with phenomenal service."
5,Best boutique hotel in Austin,"It starts with the fantastic decor for the lobby area, continues with the wonderful in-hotel coffee shop and restaurant and ends with comfortable, clean and spacious rooms.Its also worth mentioning that the front desk staff was especially attentive and went above and beyond to make my stay an enjoyable and memorable one.My new go-to hotel when traveling for business to Austin."
5,Heading Back in August,"Location, location, location. This is smack dab in the middle of it all. The hotel, although nice, was nothing compared to the staff. Everyone we encountered were super friendly and outgoing, this is way more important than the actual property. The lobby was definitely chic, easy check in, check out. Rooms were what you'd expect, boutique, not luxury. Lot's of construction outside in the area, but close to GREAT music and bars."
5,Best kept secret in Austin ?,"Wow - Terrific from every angle ! Do not hesitate to stay here.Location - excellent ( although it’s in construction central right - that’s out of their control )Guest room - way above average ! Loved the decor . Comfy beds (pillows not so much )Great sheets , bathroom could use better lighting or at least offer lighted makeup mirror for your female travelers, showers - oh so great ! Restaurant and bar - excellent. Nice pool with views !!! Loved the lobby !Service was excellent - the biggest kudos going to staff at front drive! Well done gentlemen!I’m in the hospitality business - and can say with full confidence - this is a keeper !!!"
5,Perfect boutique hotel. Great location.,"Fabulous location and service. Great boutique hotel vibe. Loved the decor and the intimate feel. The room was large, well-appointed and overlooked the city. Originally booked the Fairmont but decided it was too close to the convention center, so booked the Kimpton instead. Great decision!"
5,Lovely stay in Austin,"I stayed at Van Zandt in May 2019. Hotel is very centrally located right next to Rainey St (party hub) and a short 15min walk to 6th street. If you're visiting over the weekend it may be a little loud at night - but that's to be expected, assuming you're in Austin to party :) Otherwise, it's a fabulous new hotel. The service is the best I've seen so far - attentive, super nice and quick. And complimentary drinks in the lobby at 5pm are actually a nice gesture and it encourages mingling! Pool area is great with plenty of sunbeds, bar and a nice view. Overall, very recommended."
4,Close to excellent,"First we will address the best. I reserved a corner spa king for an evening of relaxation with my wife. The room was very nice. The view beautiful. Staff kind and caring. Location is very good for downtown Austin. The pool was fun and interesting. Free loaner bicycles made for a fun ride around the ten mile lady bird lake trail. What keeps from being 5 star. Elevators are slow, packed and require a longer than usual wait. The hotel, other than in the rooms seems a little dark. The restaurant has poor service. I probably would stay again for leisure. On a business trip, I would not have the patience."
2,Over-priced and cheaply decorated,"We visited this hotel last weekend with family. We thought it was going to be high class, absolutely not. No coffee maker or fridge but the mini bar was stocked with sex toys! I was very offended to say the least. When I called the front desk on two various occasions I was treated unkindly. The furniture was very cheaply made for what we paid. Not to mention we had no idea the neighborhood was going to be so loud with people partying. We could hear it from the 14th floor! I know I should have done my research there, my mistake."
3,Could be cleaner,"The hotel is okay but not for the price, check in was crazy and the staff seemed overwhelmed. The rooms are a good size and the pool and restaurant are nice. My main problem is the hallways are very dirty and it seems like the cleaning staff is understaffed. At every time of the day there are glasses and room service trays left in the hallway. I think it is way overpriced for what you get."
5,"Great Hotel, great location","Amazing hotel and great service. The vibe was great and we so appreciated the complimentary beer upon arrival. THe happy hour was great, but the best part was the vinyl records playing in the lobby in the evening. Keep up the great work. A must when staying in AUstin!!"
5,“Welcome to the heart of Texas”,"Our stay began with this greeting along with a cold, local Twisted X beer. Pretty awesome way to begin a vacation. The location is amazing close to the pathway system along the river and Lady Bird lake, downtown Austin and the Rainey Street District. Rainey Street is full of great restaurants and bars with live music. The hotel is modern, very comfortable with great staff. A great place to spend some time in Austin."
5,Great Service and AMAZING Concierge Team!,"We had to spend one night in Austin back in March because we had an Informal Conference scheduled with the Texas Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners on Monday morning regarding our complaint against a vet here in Dallas. I bring that up because it our visit was not going to be a happy one (we lost our Ally last year and we have a complaint against the vet). We are IHG members and decided to try the Kimpton. Though we were only booked for a standard room (Deluxe King), when the hotel found out the reason for our visit, they were very generous and upgraded us to a Spa King prior to our arrival! In addition, we found a wonderful card signed by the concierge team and front desk team! Thanks much to Gretta and Don for being so thoughtful!! As for our experience at the hotel... yes, parking is expensive. But, I searched around and based on what I read online, the other hotels we considered would have had expensive parking fees as well. While waiting in line to check in, we were offered a beer (who doesn't love that?).. The room was spacious and clean and modern. And we enjoyed each enjoyed the complimentary wine during happy hour. We had breakfast and thought the food was good. We will definitely be back!"
4,FOOD SERVICE AND APPEARANCE,"I did not stay in a guest room. However, I attended a fundraiser at the hotel and enjoyed a wonderful meal and service . I also observed the location and design of the interior. The Hotel is in the ""Rainey Street District"" of Austin, in the southeast cusp of land between Lady Bird Lake, I-35, and Cesar Chavez (1st Street.) Due to the buzz and congestion that always exists in this area, I suggest a ride service . Beware, you need more than one, we could not get a return on Uber to get out). The hotel is modern, sparse but architecturally dramatic. We attended a seated dinner for about 200 and were served baked salmon, salad, and a side of vegetables. All were excellent and the salmon was perfectly prepared .As an experienced cook, I was impressed - almost amazed. The only caveat is that you be prepared for frenetic people traffic, I expect that it may be a bit noisy at night. If you are in for a party, this is certainly a great place to stay."
5,"Great Hotel, Fun location","First of all, the hotel itself was fantastic. It's very well appointed and right next to Rainey street which has loads fun. Had a great rooftop pool, restaurant, lounge and coffee bar. The staff is friendly and very efficient."
5,"Great Hotel, Even Better Location","I've stayed at this hotel twice in the last 6 months. The location is fantastic. You are adjacent to Rainey Street so you are in the heart of all the night time energy. You can walk across the street in the other direction and catch the path to the Lady Bird Lake trail. The hotel itself is modern and attractive. The rooms and bathrooms are nice. There is a great outdoor pool on the 4th floor with an outdoor bar. If you aren't out on Rainey Street until the bars close, consider a room on the opposite side of the hotel. My first night I could look out my window and see Rainey Street but the noise impacted my sleeping. The next morning the front desk was extremely helpful in finding me a room on the other side of the hotel for the remainder of my stay."
4,"Nice hotel, pool, restaurant","Went for a birthday weekend with 10 or so friends and stayed at the Hotel Van Zandt in Austin. Hotel is in a great location, right off Town Lake, literally on Rainey Street (around the corner.) Location is perfect to walk to restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. Rooms were modern and nice. A little dark, but that's my opinion. Beds comfortable and nice bathrooms, shower, etc. They have a wonderful restaurant for dinner, lunch, brunch, and breakfast. Also a little breakfast/lunch place in the lobby for small bites. One night we ate at the restaurant for our big party and it was amazing food. Pool is a really good scene, get there early for loungers. We rented a cabana one day, good call for a big party. We literally partied every night on Rainey Street because it's so convenient and just walked home. It was fun for a group of people. Recommend hotel for location, restaurant, and pool scene."
1,Loud music from bars all night,Music coming from the bars outside is so loud my bed is vibrating. Reading other reviews it sounds like this won’t be done until 2am. So far they are right- It’s midnight and I know I won’t be going to bed anytime soon.
4,A few pros and cons,"A short list of a few pros and cons. Free coffee in the lobby in the morning. Take advantage of that or get your $5.00 latte in the cafe and skip the $5.00 (plain coffee) in the dining room. 5:00 pm weekday happy hour in the lobby is a big hit. There is noisy construction directly in front of an beside the hotel and if your room is over the Rainey Street alley, you will hear the 5:00 AM garbage pick-up. To avoid this, take the up-sell of a room with a river view that they offer at check in and pick a floor as high up as you can get!Breakfast in the dining room has a late start and limited menu. The cafe in the lobby offers plain breakfast tacos, granola bars and pastries and they open at 6:00 AM.Geraldine's restaurant and the swimming pool share a bathroom. That's a bit weird with some people dressed up and others mostly undressed. This bathroom has low lighting and a smokey etched mirror so no chance of checking on your tan line or fixing your makeup. The hallways upstairs are also dimly lit.They love dogs here! Dog treats are free in the cafe and they give you dog goodies at the front desk when you check in.Great location for many things. The other reviews cover all of that."
5,Really Cool Hotel,"This hotel has a really trendy vibe, is comfortable and the staff are all friendly and helpful. It’s in an excellent location next to bars and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and well looked after. The pool bar and restaurant area is a lovely space to relax. I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it."
4,"Amazing location, beautiful hotel","The location of this hotel...it's perfect. It's literally two steps off Rainey Street, which is like the local college hangout/location where all the bars are. It's also right next to the river so the walking path is accessible within minutes. You can take a few-minute car ride or scooter and be in other popular destinations.It's also a very trendy hotel with beautiful furnishings and amenities. The lobby has plenty of sitting space and they have a nice cafe next to it. When you check in, the employees are extremely helpful and they also give you water and a locally brewed cider! They also have a very trendy restaurant that has food to support its swank.The rooms were beautifully furnished and in working order. There were only few issues. First, when we walked into our room, there were a couple random wrappers on the ground. The rest of the room seemed to be clean so I decided to pick up the wrappers and move on with life. Our room was located right off the elevators so whenever there was a loud group, we could hear them through the doors. Overall, everyone was quiet so it wasn't an issue. Also, we were on the 9th floor but could still hear muffled music from Rainey Street so might want to consider that if you're a light sleeper who needs complete silence. Lastly, Wifi is free, but it isn't free so might want to do research into it if you need free wifi."
5,Great hotel and great location!,The hotel is amazing and in a great location of Austin. It's easy to jump on a scooter and be downtown Austin within a few minutes. My advise is to park not he streets (to avoid paying valet fees) and grab a drink on their pool rooftop bar.
5,"Will return, unsurpassed hospitality","Booked a room for my wife’s bday weekend. Got the Solana suite as an upgrade. The place was clean, linens awesome, location was perfect. The pool area is cozy, and has an awesome view. We had our dog with us and everyone was cool about it. Excellent Happy hour for hotel guests, furnishings all around were top notch and the staff was world class. Marcy, Adam, Clarence, Alexandra (just to name a few) excelled our expectations in every interaction we had. This team’s efforts and hospitality approach should be modeled after by others seeking to have excellent service. They have a great synergy as a team and know how to make a person feel as the only guest. Will recommend and stay here again. Unsure what all the other reviews are complaining about."
4,Great location on Rainey. Busy happy hour. Good pool.,"Pros:- Location on Rainey, a cool street of bars, restaurants, and food trucks- Daily complimentary happy hour 5-6 in the lobby (gets busy)- Pool- Iced, fruit infused water jugs in lobby and at pool- Complimentary sunscreen pump at pool- Shower productsCons:- Service at the pool (non-existent)- Rooms felt blah, nothing specific to complain about but nothing special- Check-in and -out were both a little painful- Water bottle pricing in the room (ridiculous)"
3,Really different,We had a business event in town. We chose to stay here because of its location. We could walk to both the business event at JW Marriott and also walk to fun spots in the evening. When we arrived we were offered drinks while checking in. There was free water in the lobby available. I appreciated the environmental efforts of the large bottles of shampoo and body wash. No coffee pods in our room but free coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning. Our room was noisy. It faced the container bar and the construction at the front of the building. The rolling farm style door on our bathroom never quite closed right. Married thirty years but a little privacy is nice occasionally. Room was attractive and clean. Staff was very friendly. We used the many scooters available and saw the sites for an afternoon.
2,Overpriced; Underserved,"First, I was surprised to learn I had to pay $53 for valet parking because there were no other parking options. Second, for the cost of the hotel, you’d think they’d offer at least one free bottled water and coffee in your room, but instead they charge $5 for for a small bottle of water and $8 for large. If you want to be cheap on offering bottled water, at least provide free water at the ice machine.Speaking of ice machine, had to go to the next floor to fetch ice because machines are only on every other floor, another inconvenience.For the coffee, you have to request it and they will bring a Keurig machine...really, a cheap Keurig machine is what you have to REQUEST?! At least offer Nespresso if you want guests to have to go through the hassle of requesting coffee for the room.Another inconvenience, the room has no refrigerator or microwave so good luck with wanting to save any leftovers.Overall, it’s not worth the money by any stretch of the imagination. I’ve been to far better hotels that justify the cost in the product and service they provide, opposed to trying to nickel and dime you for everything. Nice hotel and nice rooms, but not nearly worth the cost."
3,"Beyond the glitter, you get average for the price.","We stayed at the Van Zandt hotel while in Austin for the MotoGP race. Let’s start with the positives.First, the hotel is located right off Rainey Street. It takes literally less than 1 minute walking to reach the heart of Rainey. Second, the hotel is definitely stylish and plush. The lobby is indeed very cool.However, once you get pass the stylish decore, you’ll find relatively small/average looking rooms. To close the toilet/shower door it took a crane. It’s like a vault door posing as a barn door. Expensive EVERYTHING (from Wi-Fi to food). Average looking pool. Their “cafe” is both expensive and under par when it comes to food- I ordered 2 breakfast tacos and they looked like miniature dumplings. Their parfait was inedible. I mean, not good. The hotel offers no self-parking, only valet. Did I mention how expensive everything was?Overall, I rank the Van Zandt as average."
3,Fell short on the basics,"Things I liked1) The decor2) The location3) The complimentary happy hourThings that I feel can be improved1) parking - I’m from Houston, where most things are fairly affordable, so I may be biased, but $53 for parking seems astronomical. Thank goodness we only stayed 1 night.2)coffee machines - there weren’t any provided in the room. You must request one. To me, an in-room coffee machine seems pretty standard.3)the WiFi - should be free and easy to connect to. It was neither.4) water - although complimentary water is provided in the lobby, I think hotels (especially at this price point) should provide complimentary water in the room. Water, especially when bought in bulk, is very CHEAP, so why not provide that to your guests for free. If concerned about the waste of bottles, get water machines to go alongside the ice machines that are in the hallways. I'm just a believer that convenience and small perks go a long way in the service industry.This place wasn’t so bad that I would NEVER return, but it’s also not a place that I’d make my go-to spot for Austin."
3,Not for me,"Although it is very trendy and cool... decorated really well, very hipster, lots of people, this hotel was not for me. It fell short on many things I look for in a luxury hotel. The walls were outrageously thin, you could literally hear people talking in the next room and it only got worse at night.This is a party hotel. Both nights drunk peeps knocked on our door thinking it was there friends room. You hear a ton of people coming in between 2-5am. You can here the music from the bars on rainy street.If you are looking for a party - the pool is popping, you are right around the corner from rainy street than this is for you.But if you are like me and like to go out and then come back to a super quite, luxury hotel where they go above and beyond with service and amenities then go else where."
5,Can't wait to stay here again,"We had a super time at this hotel, starting at check-in when we were offered a complimentary Austin beer (or bottle of water, and we went with the beer--which was delish--even though we are pretty much non drinkers). The rooms are large, with sharp bathrooms that have giant rain showers. The pool is great. But the best was brunch at Geraldine's on the fourth floor of the hotel. The band, the Michael Hale Trio, was fabulous. As was the French toast. Great service too."
5,Jewel in the crown of Austin,"This hotel should be your destination in Austin- it is a walk to everything- food, music etc. the property itself is a very hip and contemporary vibe and the staff knocks themselves out to make you happy. The room and bathrooms are spacious and immaculately clean. They have a free happy hour everyday with beer, wine, and excellent margaritas. There is nothing that the staff won’t do to assist you- their customer interface is outstanding. Our room was facing the Congress ave bridge so we had a ringside seat to the beautiful sunset over the city as well as the infamous bat flights at dusk from under the Congress ave bridge. We highly recommend this property!"
5,"Great, hip and modern hotel","Stayed for an IT Conference and I give it 99% great. Clean room, great bed, Nice With the cofee shop downstairs, Close to Rainey street fun.Staff is super helpful and friendly.When i checked in they asked if I wanted a water or beer, that has never happened, puts an Instant smile on all faces.Only compaint, was they rented out the pool areas for a private event, and that really killed the pool time that day. After working inside I was really wanting a 4:30pm drink at the bar outside in the sunset, then you have no place to go."
4,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel with lots of great features. The lobby and service is really good. A few major considerations that I wish that the hotel would have told me upon check-in, that my upgraded room included an all-night concert series on Rainey Street!! The room was very expensive by the way!!!! My room overlooked the back parts of the bars and let's just say it was not a restful 4 days. If you are looking for a relaxed stay in any way, this is no your place. The parking is SOOO expensive as is the pool side drinks. For a vegan friendly place in Austin, there were NO vegan options for food at Geraldine's by bar or in restaurant. The hotel staff were pleasant and front door crew were very nice. Also, the coffee shop baristas were amazing!!"
4,"Very nice, a party scene","This is a nice hotel. The rooms are big and mine looked over the pool. The staff was super nice. It’s right off Rainey St, and there’s a bunch of bars nearby. There were lots of people havin a good time when I came home late one night. It’s all a lot of fun, but you are signing up for a livelier hotel than you might expect. I enjoyed it, but I’m not sure I’d book if I were going for a more laid back stay."
4,Spring break plus SXSW visit,"Nice hotel, great location, walking distance to 6th street in downtown Austin and the Rainey Street district. One HUGE problem, they charge $50/night to park your car. These is no self-park option. The desk clerk did not mention this on check-in and she knew we drove because she guided us in through the street closures. It is on the website under 'amenities' however, though clearly this is not an amenity. No coffee maker in the room, though you can request a K-cup maker. The cleaning staff took it away and we had to ask for it again for the next morning. No refrigerator, only a mini bar in the room. Music from outside could heard even on the upper floors. Concierge did not know the name of the museum right behind the hotel, not did he have any information about the Circuit of the Americas race track in town. OK happy hour between 5-6PM. Limited choices on the TV without paying. Door and valet staff very friendly and helpful."
5,AWESOME HOTEL,"Location is perfect, very nice, beautiful views. Excellent bar, food, staff perfect hotel. Rooms are very nice, well maintained. If you keep checking sometimes they have flash sales, the rooms are much cheaper."
4,Weekend Vist,The hotel was very nice and well maintained. It is in a good location with plenty to do in the area. We attended a banquet and the food and service was excellent. I would recommend the hotel to anyone.
3,BYOEP. Thin walls are a deal breaker.,"I really wanted to like this place - beautifully decorated, nice staff, the barista makes a proper dry cappuccino. I’m in Austin about once a month so I was excited to try this place out.However, it saddens me that the one big cost saving they decided was a great idea for their big, new, almost-luxury hotel was thin walls. Come on, y’all, there’s no coming back from that. I write this to you as my neighbor room has woken me up from (1) first phone alarm, presumably set to snooze, (2) second phone alarm, presumably set to snooze, (3) third phone alarm where this guy said screw it I’m sleeping through it so now I’ve been listening to what Apple has deemed a pleasant way to wake up for 10 minutes.Other things I’ve heard from my room:-sneezing, so loud you’d swear the person was in the room with you-snoring in the middle of the night, which on the bright side made me appreciative of my non-snoring spouse-doors opening and closing, hours before it was my turn to wake up for the day-TV from other neighbor until the 11 o clock hour-and yes, the construction mentioned in other reviews but honestly that was the least of my woes.. and unfortunately my bigger woes cannot be fixed with nice words so into the blacklist this hotel goes.In summary, I won’t be back. If you do come, consider it a BYOEP kind of place. (Bring your own ear plugs)"
4,Amazing & Hip location in Austin,"We stayed here in January for two nights on a weekend trip to Austin from San Francisco and we absolutely loved it. The hotel's location is excellent, with easy access to nature as well as the endless shopping and bars. You really can go anywhere from the Van Zandt. If you don't want to walk, there are endless scooters across the city that can take you around quickly as well.Overall, I would recommend the Lakeview Spa King as the #1 room because the views are outstanding and the tub with a view are top notch. The rooms are beautiful, clean and the turndown was excellent in the evenings.My favorite feature of the hotel is the classic Kimpton happy hour, where they serve complimentary wine, beer and margaritas in the lobby over amazing records playing by the fireplace. Absolutely LOVED it. We spent many hours just relaxing in the lobby, which is not very common for us to do. They have comfy couches, faux-fur blankets and the warm fire to relax after a long day of walking around.Geraldine's was incredible as well- we can't recommend it enough. The food was top-notch, the live music was fun and the drinks were excellent.We do have a full review on our blog at voyagerguru .com so if you're looking for more information, check it out!"
4,Fun and funky hotel in a great part of town,"I stayed here for two nights on business in January 2019. The hotel is a great option for people seeking something different than your standard Marriott/Hilton experience. The decor is fun and funky. The rooms are large and comfortable. The bathrooms are significantly better than average. The location is in easy walking distance to many local restaurants or big office buildings in downtown Austin.There was a major issue with hot water the morning of my stay and there was none to be had for a morning shower. The hotel could have managed this outage better. We weren't alerted to the problem. And, after a very cold, startling shower and a quick phone call to the front desk, I was told that someone would come to fix the problem shortly. Two hours later and no visit from maintenance. I stopped at the front desk on my way out to meetings and was told that they'd identified the problem and it should be fixed shortly. While I appreciated their quick work to solve the issue, I didn't appreciate the lack of communication or consideration given for the outage."
1,Ants in our bed!!!,"We stayed here February 22 & 23rd, 2019. We had ants in our room (bedside table and bed)! For $400/night they weren't even chocolate covered! The front desk people were rude in addressing this problem and didn't offer anything for our trouble. Crazy! Each time I went down to the front desk to tell them about the ants, they looked at me like I was bothering them. All they did was send someone (twice) from ""engineering"" to spray the ants. I reached out to the Hotel Van Zandt before posting this and all I got was the sound of....crickets! Back to St Cecilia, Hotel San Jose or anywhere else but here when in Austin."
5,Great place!,"Stayed here for two nights while attending a conference. Loved everything about it! Cool vibe, funny and friendly staff. Oh - they offer a BEER as you check in - made me laugh! Great daily happy hour, comfortable room. Really enjoyed my stay, and thought the room was spotless and comfortable. Will be coming back!"
2,BEWARE!,"Beware all, while this hotel is lovely, convenient and the service I found top notch, there is construction going on next door and right on the river side next to the pool. Looks like a brand new building is being built. At about 8am each day Monday-Saturday you will be woken up by the lovely sounds of jackhammering and banging. Book at your own risk and make sure to ask how long that will be going on for. Also if you ask for a room on the other side you will be near Rainey St very close to the bars."
5,"Great Location, Beautiful Layout and Wonderful Staff","The hotel is beautiful has everything you need, a good coffee shop, bar, live music, staff and very nice rooms. It isn't cheap but it is worth it for the location. We ended each night at Geraldines for drinks and live music, used the bikes to ride around the lake (aka river) and enjoyed the lobby happy hour."
5,Awesome location,Great hotel- a few feet away from rainy street! Came here for a bachelorette party and had a great time. Free hour of happy hour over the weekend! Well decorated rooms and a cute cafe downstairs. Would come back again!
5,Cool Vibes,I stayed there last year and liked the amenities this hotel provides. Coming from chill New England straight to hot swimming pool on some of the upper floors felt rewarding. Rooms are simple and modern. Service was great. I will definitely book this hotel next time I am in Austin.
4,"busy, hip hotel BUT it can get loud","Stayed here for work. If you're looking to socialize, the lobby and hotel restaurants are always busy. But if you are staying for work, the noise can get bothersome. The hotel seems darker, it's the ambiance they're going for, which is OK, but just be aware. The walls are paper thin so be mindful of your noises.I found that the Uber drivers got lost a lot trying to pick-up from there. Not sure if it's just the drivers or if this is a newer hotel. Be sure to allocate time in the morning if you're leaving from here to your meeting."
1,"Noisy, Unorganized, Disappointed","The hotel is hip. Its business model should be more traditional. The hallway to the room was so dark that I could barely see the numbers of the wall or navigate the circuitous route to my room. I also don’t care for sliding a heavy barn door to close the bathroom door. The front desk made a mess of my bill, which should have been paid by my host but ended up on my card. Extra phone calls cleared it up, but it should standard operating procedure. If you want a noisy hotel on the weekend with unwelcome music until 2am, this hotel is for you. Not for me."
3,"Great Location, Paper Thin Walls","This hotel is in a great location, right off Rainey St. The front desk and valet staff were amazing, and the room was gorgeous. My only problem was with their paper-thin walls: My friend and I were talking at 2am - not screaming, yelling, or blasting music - and our neighbors could hear us. They called the front desk and filed a noise complaint, because the walls are so thin that they could hear our conversation. When security showed up, he literally told us that even though we were talking in normal tones, we - two adults who had paid good money for a nights stay in their establishment - needed to “whisper”. I was not happy.And may I point out, the next morning we were woken up by every single conversation and door slam next to, and outside of our room, including the someone standing in the hallway having a conversation about what they thought of the Super Bowl halftime show. I liked being able to walk from Rainey, but I doubt I will be staying here again."
5,First time in a Kimpton,"I am an IHG Spire Member and have never stayed in a Kimpton. Very nice hotel. Staff is very friendly. Enjoyed using the secret code at check in and got my parking comped! $50 savings. Was hoping for an upgrade, but was there on Valentine’s Day so that is expected not to get one. Rooms nicely done. Some crazy things in the mini bar. Bed was super comfortable. 2 robes were provided in the room. Did not use the pool, but looked like a nice hang out place when the weather is warm."
5,Amazing Stay,"We stayed at Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt to celebrate a birthday. We are big Kimpton fans and this property blew us away. From the moment we arrived to us leaving the all of our expectations were exceeded. We have stayed at several other Kimptons and The Van Zandt is certainly on the top of our list. We were greeted when we arrived and helped on the way out by valet. Alexandra at check in was professional and kind and even helped with suggestions in the area. Our housekeeper Myra was attentive and friendly. We had a cocktail at the bar in Geraldine's and Eddie took great care of us. The room had an amazing view, ample space and most importantly was spotless. The hotel itself is located in a great area and reflects Austin's culture and history, which is what we love to see when visiting a Kimpton in a new city."
5,The best all-around hotel in Austin. Period.,"Austin's seen a veritable explosion of new hotels over the past decade, including plenty of boutique properties -- this after having basically only one player in town, the Hotel San Jose (and its Saint Cecilia sister property), with the market essentially to itself for nearly 15 years. Since 2008, however, Austin's hotel boom has brought every major player in the field into its arena, ranging from ""boutique-style corporate"" (e.g. its first W Hotel) to a slew of indie offerings. To put it another way, the Hotel Van Zandt has a ton of competition -- and over the years I've stayed at nearly all of them -- but nonetheless lands at the top of the pack, in my view: it's the best all-around hotel in Austin.My most recent stay there only further reminded me how superior the Van Zandt is to its competition in nearly every tangible way -- which, I have to admit, came as a surprise: the Kimpton chain, long viewed as one of the best all-around, fully merged its Karma rewards program into that of its parent company, IHG, just over a year ago. Plenty of Kimpton fans, myself included, worried that this integration would result in a deterioration of the service quality for which Kimpton is renowned. I'm happy to report that no such problems have occurred at the Van Zandt -- in notably stark contrast to IHG's other downtown Austin four-star property, the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin, where I also stayed recently. The only chain of size in the U.S. that tops it is the Four Seasons -- though I should certainly hope so, considering Four Seasons hotels are typically the most expensive in any given market. (Rooms at the Four Seasons Austin are usually more than twice the price of the Van Zandt's.)Kimpton is famous for its bold interior looks -- all of which vary depending on the property and the city in which it's located -- and the Van Zandt is no exception; if anything, Kimpton went much bigger and bolder than usual in crafting the Van Zandt's look. To be fair, this isn't a hotel for fans of traditional interiors: its look is unabashedly modern, embracing a mix of industrial and high-end '60s-era vintage design (along with some surprisingly strong new design elements, including the likes of Roll & Hill light fixtures). Its massive lobby and ground-floor public areas, replete with numerous visitor-friendly seating areas for groups both large and small, brings New York's Ace Hotel to mind (and that's entirely a compliment) -- most notably in its extensive use of black, a color (or, more accurately, a non-color) that's extremely difficult to get right, but also its seeming vastness.Upon arrival for my most recent stay, I was warmly greeted despite having booked a last-minute ""staycation"" via Hotwire at a substantial discount (during Austin's low season). As a former professional hotel critic (and, more recently, a mere unusually frequent traveler), I've seen firsthand how surprisingly frequently certain properties treat guests who've booked their stays on the likes of Hotwire and Hotel Tonight as de facto second-class citizens; that's decidedly not the case here. A new forward-thinking innovation added since my last stay was the ability to reach the hotel's concierge via text: this is one of those ""why hasn't anyone else thought of it?"" ideas that's both savvy and effective. (They also texted me several times during my stay to inquire how it was going and whether I needed assistance with anything, a very welcome gesture.)The Van Zandt's rooms vary somewhat in size, but all of them incorporate design cues such as bronzed fixtures -- which have since become de rigueur in both hotel and contemporary home design -- and ridiculously comfortable beds replete with top-of-the-line pillows and luxury linens. Its larger ones feature Duravit-style standalone bathtubs, many of which offer jaw-dropping views of downtown Austin and Lady Bird Lake. (Speaking of which, I'd strongly recommend getting a lakeview room if possible. Here, too, the Van Zandt is unparalleled in contrast to nearly every other downtown Austin hotel.)I'm also not generally a fan of four-star hotels that don't have some sort of coffeemaker in their guest rooms, but the Van Zandt -- similar to other Kimpton properties -- does one better: it offers a complimentary coffee bar setup in its lobby. And in terms of going the extra mile, it has ample copies of The New York Times available for complimentary guest use as well -- including the Sunday Times, which costs $7 a pop outside the NYC area. This is precisely the type of much-appreciated-but-not-a-necessity amenity that's been largely eliminated by the corporate bean counters at major chains, and the fact that Kimpton continues to offer it -- despite being acquired nearly five years ago by one of the largest hotel holding companies in North America -- speaks volumes about its service caliber all-around.As a native Austinite, I can't help but appreciate the ""local touches"" incorporated into the Van Zandt -- starting with its namesake Townes Van Zandt, one of Austin's most legendary musical icons. Its lobby cafe also features breakfast tacos from Tacodeli, a local mini-chain that makes some of the best in town; the hotel doesn't substantially mark up their prices, either. (Just FYI, the cafe is where to go if you prefer espresso or lattes over the lobby's free drip coffee.) Similarly, during Kimpton's traditional ""wine hour"" each afternoon, the Van Zandt offers Austin's ""unofficial official drink"" -- frozen margaritas -- in addition.Finally, its location is one of the best in town: smack-dab in the middle of Austin's Rainey St area, which features one of its most lively nightlife scenes. It's also within easy walking distance of the convention center, and at least easy scooter distance from Sixth Street and the rest of downtown Austin. As is now typical in most larger American cities, inexpensive dockless scooters from the likes of Bird and Lime are ubiquitous and nearly always available nearby for a $1/hour rental fee -- and if you prefer two-wheeled transportation of the non-motorized variety, the Van Zandt also has complimentary bicycles available for rides along Austin's nearby hike-and-bike trail around Lady Bird (née Town) Lake, one of the city's best natural features.To be fair, the Van Zandt isn't totally perfect, though none of its flaws are even vaguely consequential enough to dissuade one from staying there, in my view. The hotel's east-facing side offers a view of ... well, mainly a high-traffic freeway. It features live bands downstairs many nights, which is great if you're a fan but less so if you're a light sleeper with a room on a lower floor. (The bands' bass reverberates upwards.) Weekend brunches at Geraldine's, the hotel's primary restaurant, are great, but they're also increasingly popular, so even as a hotel guest you may have to wait for a table if you don't have a reservation. (OTOH you can always grab a bite at its informal lobby cafe instead.) While its windows are insulated enough to muffle most of the surrounding area's noise, that's sometimes not the case when a band happens to be playing outdoors at an immediately adjacent bar on Rainey. Also, its insulation between rooms isn't terrible but also not perfect: during my most recent stay I could audibly here an ""amorous"" couple in the room next door. (Though they were admittedly exceptionally loud...) NB: Noise problems at many of the Van Zandt's downtown competitors -- most notably the Driskill, The Line, the Stephen F. and Westin -- are worse by a considerable margin.Like nearly all of downtown's hotels, its parking charges are a steep $40 or so per night. (Unless you're driving into Austin, I'd recommend getting around via Lyft or Uber instead.) The surrounding Rainey St. area's popularity also has its negatives, in particular the aforementioned noise issues as well as trying to merely get there via car on weekends (and event periods such as SXSW are pretty much a hot mess in that regard). Finally, its elevated pool deck is shared with an adjacent condo tower, and while it features a lively bar and excellent downtown & lake views, its chaises are limited in number (if only because the pool deck's inherent size constraints) and fill up quickly on warm-weather days, especially springtime weekends. (Also, its liveliness includes a fair amount of noise, which can be readily heard in rooms on lower floors directly facing the pool deck.) And again, this is not a place for fans of traditional design; if you prefer brightly lit ""cheerful"" looks and primary color palettes, you'd probably be happier at the new Fairmont two blocks north.But still: even given its flaws -- most of which can be avoided by requesting a room on a high floor -- the Van Zandt remains in a league of its own. It's not my favorite Austin hotel -- the Saint Cecilia wins my vote there, but it's considerably smaller and pricier, and thus lacks many of the features seen in larger properties -- but it's nonetheless the best on an all-around basis, in my opinion."
5,"Great service, location, and style","Arrived late morning so room wasn't ready (check in 4 PM) - front desk took my mobile to text me when room was ready (2PM!). Not sure why but got upgraded to corner suite on upper floor. Maybe because it was my wife's birthday? Anyway, we were pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of champagne with 2 flutes and 2 birthday cupcakes in our room. Nice touch. Nicely furnished rooms with bluetooth speaker for your phone. Ample closet and drawer space. Bonus yoga mat and umbrella in closet. Front desk would text daily to check up to see how stay was coming along. Took advantage of the following hotel amenities: 1) in room massage with $30 credit for IHG members, 2) morning coffee/tea service in lobby, 3) social hour (5-6PM) wine/daily cocktail/beer 4) 24 hr fitness center, 5) tasty dinner at their restaurant Geraldine's with free musical performance at 10:30. Didn't get a chance to use the free bicycle or their pool as the weather was suboptimal (highs in the 40s and wintery mix) but we'll be sure to use them next visit when it's warmer - because why would we want to stay anywhere else next time we're in Austin?!"
4,Decent.,"Decent room size. Neat & clean rooms & bathrooms.Amenities are not well explained during the check-in.For the price - they should include free coffee & breakfast.The study table did not have a chair, though there were 2 heavy chairs in the room, would expect a revolving movable chair by the study table,"
1,Terrible experience,"High price for an average experience , rooms are poor quality , the shower does not have a door so you will get everything wet , only one toilet paper for 3 people , no sleepers , insulation is poor so you can hear everything and finally I have to wait for 1 hour for breakfast because you need a reservation ( nobody told me that at front desk when I check in )"
5,"Easy, Pleasant Stay. High Five!","Great reception, beautiful lobby, happy hour drinks, clean, comfortable rooms, quiet hallways, awesome location.The coffee shop connected to the lobby makes AWESOME breakfast tacos.My only complaint was the price of parking. Will definitely stay here next time I'm in town."
5,Best Hotel in Austin,"The Hotel Van Zandt offers everything you need for a great hotel stay. The location is fantastic—literally on the corner of Rainey St. close to lots of restaurants and entertainment. The lobby is so pleasing to the eye—unique decor, clean, and spacious. The rooms are good size, impeccably clean, and I love the full size bath products. We were a group of 4 women and having full size shampoo and body wash made it so much easier than having to worry about how many mini bottles we had. The restaurant Geraldine’s was pricey but had a great vibe, the workout room had the greatest photo mural on the wall (and the equipment was clean and plentiful too), and to top it off there was a nightly happy hour with free wine and margaritas! And coffee and tea bar in the mornings. My friends and I had a wonderful stay here. The staff was friendly and more than willing to store our luggage after checkout so we could explore a little more before our flight home. I love how they texted me when the room was ready at check in. We spent a lot of time in front of the beautiful fireplace sipping our coffee or wine, and the cafe off the lobby had great breakfast tacos and pastries, including gluten free banana bread! I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Austin."
5,Beautiful Hotel and Great Vibe,"I spent two nights at the Van Zandt for a conference and had a great experience! Check in was smooth with a very enthusiastic staffer. My room was decorated very nicely with tons of storage space, a few chairs and space to work. The bath had a spacious shower and separate area for the sink. We enjoyed the complimentary happy hour in the lobby. The buffet lunches during our meeting were very good."
5,Amazing valet,"Will was great! Hurried to open my door from the hotel to my car and immediately grabbed my bag to put into my car.. really appreciated the quality of the service.. I will be back for sure, thank you Will!!"
3,Great location,"The Kimpton is ideally located for restaurants and bars. Don't expect a quiet hotel. Wine hour is always very busy and a great perk! Comfortable room and bed. Bathroom was okay, could be updated. Restaurant for breakfast was good with some interesting options."
3,"Just ""ok""","My partner and I were celebrating our 3-year anniversary, so I decided to take advantage of my annual IHG Rewards free night and booked us at the Kimpton for a nice ""staycation"". Being that we live in Austin, we 100% knew what to expect when it came to the hotel's location, parking arrangements, proximity to everything, noise levels, etc. So this review is not based on any of those things. The hotel itself is nice, although not quite luxury. We stayed in a Spa King room, and the bathroom was beautiful as promised - although it would have been nice if the tub was big enough to fit two people. As for the bed, it was comfortable... but, we have a king sized bed at home - and unless I'm just crazy, this ""king"" was not actually king sized. Even still, I didn't knock off stars for any of that. I only knocked off stars for the negative aspects which were completely within the hotel staff's control and 100% due to human error.- After I made my reservation, I called to ask if I could have a late checkout so we could go have brunch Sunday morning. They said ""no problem"", as this is one of the perks of being an IHG Platinum member, and we arranged for a 1pm checkout. In this same call, I told them we would be celebrating our anniversary, and also that we would be bringing our dog with us - so we would need a dog bed and food/water bowls placed in the room. They said this was all confirmed (hint: it wasn't)- When I received my ""upcoming stay"" email a few days prior to the check in date, it did not indicate the 1pm late checkout. It did give an option to select some ""preferences"" via dropdown boxes, so I went ahead and selected ""Anniversary"" as the special occasion, and (again) indicated that I would be bringing a dog and would need a bed & food/water bowls.-Being that the late checkout wasn't indicated on the email, I called the hotel just to confirm. The person I spoke with said there was no record of a late checkout, or anniversary, or dog notated in my reservation. This was stressful, since I had arranged this twice now, both verbally and online. Thankfully, she was able to get it all changed.-When we arrived at the hotel and checked in, we were not offered a free beer or water. Not sure if they just don't do that anymore, but seems strange being that so many other reviewers have commented on it.-When we got into our room, there was no dog bed or food/water bowls. I had to call the front desk to ask for them... for a 3rd time (4th if you count the online form).-We were also given no information about how to connect to the free WiFi, which is another perk for being IHG Platinum members. We looked all over the room for something listed on a guide or whatever, but there was nothing. So I had to call the front desk again to ask for the WiFi information. I find it in poor service that this information was not given to us upon check in.-We took our dog out for a walk, went back to our room, and realized that the key didn't work (we had previously used the other 1 out of 2 keys to get in). I had to go all the way back down eight floors while my partner waited outside the room with our dog, trying to keep her from eating food off of the room service trays that were littering the hallway. When I got downstairs, the concierge asked for my ID. Of course, my ID was locked in my room. So I had to answer a series of questions instead, for security purposes - which I understand and appreciate, but would never have had to do if our room keys were activated properly to begin with.-Finally, after checkout - I noticed a $177.79 charge on my credit card. My room was free and we had no incidentals, so I had no idea what this was. I called the hotel, and they said it was a pre-authorization for incidentals, and would drop off in 3-5 business days. I'm fine with a pre-auth, but it would have been nice if someone told us explicitly what to expect so I didn't have to wonder and waste my time calling. When I had given the concierge my card upon check-in, I asked ""This is only for incidentals, right?"" ...he confirmed that it was, then swiped it, and had me sign. He never said anything about a pre-auth, though that would have been the obvious time to communicate this.All in all, this was a pleasant stay for a free night. However, I believe the regular price for the room we stayed in is around $450 + taxes and fees. If I had actually paid even half of that, then the service levels here would have left me feeling severely underwhelmed. I was kind of embarrassed that I had talked this hotel up to my partner as being ""one of the best hotels in town"", but then kept having to call to inquire about basic information and amenities.As for some of the positive things:- They sent us a bottle of wine and some fruit after (finally) acknowledging our special occasion / anniversary... so that was a nice touch. Even though the glass bowl the fruit was in had a big chip on the top, making it sharp.- There is a text concierge system that will text you to make sure your room is ok and ask if you need anything. Too bad I didn't get the first text until I had already called for everything I needed.So, yeah... it was ""meh"". Definitely not worth several hundred dollars, but worth it if you have a free rewards night to burn."
5,Wonderful Experience,"My wife and I were in Austin for the gubernatorial inauguration and chose to stay at the Kimpton. We are so glad we did! We were upgraded to a suite with a nice living area and a standalone tub in the bathroom.Soon after arriving, the manager sent us a bottle of wine and cheese spread to welcome us and to help us celebrate the big day. It was a wonderful touch and made for a wonderful evening.We had drinks at the hotel bar and enjoyed it. Work routinely takes me to Austin and I will make an effort to always stay at the Kimpton. It is a great place to stay."
2,Not a luxury hotel,"Not my first time in the hotel - I had previously visited the restaurant and bar. But this was my first and last time to stay overnight. This is maybe the loudest hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere except a Polish hotel over a bar. But even this won. Here are the positives and negatives:The lobby is pretty cool. Very hip and masculine looking. Staff was friendly but could be more conversational. It's dog friendly - we saw four of them in the lobby at once. The hallways upstairs however seemed to be decorated for Halloween - extremely dark and not attractive in my opinion. The location is good if you are going to be at the convention center or just hanging out on Raney Street. If not, it's an average location at the edge of downtown.The rooms are just very average and have some problems. The walls are paper thin and you'll definitely hear your neighbor. The bathroom sink area has no door so the light shines into the room if someone goes in. The toilet and shower area have a sliding pocket door that is very heavy and difficult to close. The shower has no door, just a half glass wall. The shower is not long enough for this feature so the floor in the toilet area gets very wet. Also, the drywall gets splashed and they no doubt have had mold issues because that wall had evidence of being plastered and repainted more than once. And the painters didn't bother to cut in the paint along the door jam so just slopped it over. Bad workmanship in what is supposed to be a luxury hotel.A couple of other little things that are annoying. A small bottle of water on your nightstand has a price on the cap saying $5. The larger bottle is $8. No, this is not some special water, just something that cost them ten cents but they want to gouge me for $5. And wifi is not free.Add all that to the noise issues (dogs barking, bands til late hours) and this is just not a place you'll want to stay if you intend to sleep. Go across the street to the Fairmont or over to the JW. Or if you are hell-bent on staying on Raney Street then go to the Homewood Suites and get a room that is probably nicer.One final tip - if you just have to stay at the Van Zandt then whatever you do get the highest floor possible. Floors 5 - 7 are very loud, especially the ones overlooking the pool or Raney. The band in the hotel bar plays til midnight and if you are on the lower floors you will feel the bass drum in your bed and get to hear the singer."
4,Classic Kimpton Flair and Hospitality!,"This is a fantastic hotel and really epitomizes everything I love about Kimpton Hotels. Centrally located, funky design, wonderful, helpful staff and comfortable rooms. I had a few glitches but all was handled beautifully by Dylan P. An amzing and thoughtful staff member. The lobby is so comfortable, especially during the wine hour and here there were also house-made margaritas! Rooms are clean and well-appointed, WiFi is quick and simple to access, especially if you are an IHG member. My only complaint is the noise, if you are facing Rainey Street.The hotel did move me to quieter room, but ask for one when you check in, those Austin folk know how to make music! I would absolutely stay here again!"
5,Great Stay,"Any arrival when you get offered free local craft beer at reception is going to start me off with a positive experience and it didn’t stop there. A text from reception when entering the room checking your satisfaction was intuitive and showed they care about your happiness, another text the following day reinforced this sentiment. The rooms are very nicely designed,, bathrooms are not overly luxurious in comparison to there rest of the room but the amenities were of excellent quality. The minibar selection is excellent. The main restaurant is worth the visit alone and a serious destination restaurant that must be experienced when in Austin. Loads of interesting street food/food trucks right around the corner is another great option for dining in this great hotel. Comp margaritas at 5pm in the stunning lobby is another great touch that really does build Good will with there guests. Well done Kimpton, cool brand"
1,DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR VALUABLES STOLEN OUT OF YOUR ROOM.,"DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR VALUABLES STOLEN OUT OF YOUR ROOM.Stayed here one night. Checked in hotel with my wallet and went home without it. Woke up (in room 1101) and went to meeting inside the hotel at restaurant on the 4th floor. Put my wallet in nightstand draw in the morning before leaving the room. After meeting went back to my room and room key didn't work anymore because they checked me out of my room (granted it was 1pm). Went to lobby to get new key and they had the bellboy take me upstairs to let me in. Opened the draw next to the bed where I left my wallet and the wallet was gone along with my Drivers License, ALL my credit cards, and $1200 cash. The ""Director of Loss Prevention"", Phillip Englishbee told me there is nothing he can do because its my word against hers (the lady who cleaned the room). He also patronized me and told me about how he thought I was going to find my wallet in my luggage when I got home, like it miraculously jumped from the draw to my luggage… well I guess what, it didn't. So I checked in hotel with my wallet and had to leave this hotel and Austin without it and the lady who stole it still works there.If employees at this hotel know that is the policy all they have to do is say they didn't do it, its basically a green light to steal anything they want from your room.DO NOT STAY HERE."
5,A lovely stay!,"We loved our stay at the Van Zandt! From the incredibly friendly and helpful staff to the great food at Geraldine's to the rooms themselves, we cannot say enough good things, and will definitely make this our first choice in Austin.As other reviewers have said, it is possible to hear the nightly live music from the hotel restaurant even on higher floors, but it's not something we found bothersome - you really had to be listening to hear it. The comfort of the room more than made up for it, with a generous amount of space, huge closets, and firm yet squashy beds. It's also just around the corner from Rainey Street and an easy walk over to the downtown area, which was a huge plus. If you're looking for a great hotel in a highly walkable neighborhood, I'd definitely recommend the Van Zandt!"
5,Our new favorite hotel!! Going to be in Austin - STAY HERE!,"We absolutely loved the Van Zandt. First and foremost the staff was amazing - everyone was so accommodating and couldn't have been nicer. We arrived early and they found us a room that would be ready a few hours in advance of check-in AND we got an upgrade! They also recognized my IHG status and gave me and my wife a special treat as it was our anniversary. (Thanks Marcy!). The room was absolutely beautiful, laid out perfectly, super comfortable (we are excited to buy the same pillows for our home), and the view was even better than we expected. The hotel isn't in the middle of downtown - but super a close - a less than 10 minute walk. And if your destination is Rainey Street, you couldn't be closer. There really isn't anything we didn't love about this hotel. Our only regret is that we didn't stay here longer! This was our first trip to Austin and we hadn't necessarily planned to return - but now we have one great reason to go back!"
5,AUSome!!!!! (Get it),"I guess you can say that I am on a Kimpton hotel tour. This is my 3rd stay at a kimpton hotel and I must say it did not disappoint. When I walked into the lobby I was welcomed with a nice drink and Jarrod took care of me. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and is in a great location. It was very busy but the service was still top notch. I received an upgrade because of my spire elite status and my room was immaculate. Sadly, I was only there for one night. I can't wait fo return and can't imagine staying anywhere else in Austin!"
5,Beautiful hotel and room,Our room was upgraded at check in. It had 2 queen rooms with a separate seating area. It had a beautiful view of downtown Austin. The bathroom had a separate marble tub and a huge shower. The toilet had a closed door inside the bathroom. The room was big enough for a family of 4. The only downside to staying is the near $50 to park. There are not many options around that are cheaper. There are many food trucks and restaurants within 5 minutes walk from the hotel as well as a small supermarket with 10 minutes walk. Found the staff and valets to be friendly and helpful. It was a 5 minute drive to the capital from the hotel. I would stay here again.
5,"If I ever go back to Austin, I would only stay here.","My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week. We had an amazing time. The hotel was beautiful and we loved our room. They provided hot and iced coffee every morning and then margaritas in the afternoon. It was a great location right next to rainey street. The pool was awesome! They also have free bikes you can use, which saved us a lot of money on transportation. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
5,Absolutely beautiful with large spacious rooms and fun happy hour,"Our stay at the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt came at the end of our week-long vacation and it was the perfect last stop. The hotel is absolutely beautiful - my husband and I joked that we weren't cool enough to stay there but that the free margaritas, beer and wine served daily from 5-6 would help with that! We had a double queen spa room and it was spacious and extremely clean. The bathroom was modern and the free standing bathtub was so inviting that it was the first time I ever dared bathe in a hotel bathtub. The valet guys were friendly & fast. We really enjoyed our stay!"
3,Beautiful Lobby....,"Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt has a beautiful updated lobby. Other than that, can't say much else, comfortable bed I suppose?The building is definitely old. I live in an apartment building in NYC so I am used to noise, I must say, the slamming of the doors of other people in hotel will shake your core its so loud. Not the guests fault but you need to slam the door for it to close properly.The heating/cooling system, when it gets to the temperature, you hear a click from the monitor on the wall and then a bang a few seconds later from the grate across the room - very odd & loud/startling.Our room was on Rainey Street so very loud until about 1-2 am FYI.Hotel is far from everything in Austin other than Rainey Street honestly. We walked home most nights & was not necessarily scared but it is dark and desolate by this hotel.Shower was nice & updated, room was comfortable as was bed. Staff was nice as was the lobby but overall I would not recommend if you want to be active in all that is happening in Austin."
5,Awesome!,"Just amazing! From the front desk people, Don you are amazing! To the swimming pool, the love music, the rooms, the lobby and the complementary drinks at 17! You couldn’t ask for more! Can’t wait to comeback! ❤️"
5,Christmas Trip to Austin - Kimpton Hotel Rocks!,"My wife and I travel to Austin every year around Christmas for some year end R&R. This was our first time staying at the Kimpton but definitely not our last. The hotel, restaurant, rooms, and staff so far exceeded our expectations. I spend 150+ nights/per year in hotels all over the world and this is now in my top 5. This place has everything you want in a full service hotel. Geraldine’s is by far the best restaurant at any hotel possible one of the best restaurants in Austin."
5,Beautiful Hotel and perfect location!,"We stayed at the Van Zandt before Christmas, the stay was great, the hotel is beautiful, our room was spectacular and very big, with view to the 2 sides of the hotel, it was very very pretty! The bed was amazingly comfortable and the staff is super helpful, on top of that the location is perfect, next to all the restaurants and bars, we loved it, stay at this hotel when you visit Austin!"
5,Christmas Day Austin,"Everything was fantastic. Our sweet rescue's 1st hotel night...everyone treated him like a king! Dinner at the hotel restaurant was good...the staff outstanding!Beautiful hotel, we will be back ASAP!"
4,Good but not the best,"There are many things about this hotel that we liked but certain things about it made me want to rate it with 4 stars.This hotel is located not too far from I-35 (5mins drive). Like other reviewers have mentioned the parking is not included with your expensive nightly stays. $48 including taxes for valet parking is outrageous! There is no option for self parking which I would have gladly done for a reasonable price. I am sure there are better options than this. The valet are friendly and brought our car back within few minutes from the 4 story underground garage that they have underneath the hotel.The check in was quick. The room was very nice. Lots of amenities in the room and on property. They have yoga mat in the room! Lots of items in the mini bar. No space to keep your own drinks and food. The bed is comfortable and bathroom is very clean and modern.The perk: they have complementary coffee and hot chocolate from 6am-10am. They also have social hour from 5pm-6pm every day where they serve margaritas, wine and beer.They have indoor pool on 4th floor adjacent to the $$$ restaurant. Expensive restaurant because they serve in small plates (tapas) and its 2 plates per person. However, the food is not something you will easily find in other restaurants and it is delicious. So, I do recommend it.There is also a cafe on the first floor on the left as you enter and the food their is very reasonable price ($3.25 for breakfast taco). They have sone packed salads and sandwiches plus they make other hot sandwiches when you order.The parking in Austin might be expensive but we are already paying for the room which was not cheap. It should have been either included or at a very discounted rate.The checkout was also quick. One thing we noticed that the people at the checkin desk need to let their guests know that the parking is $48 including taxes. We would not have known if we hadn't asked the valet guy."
3,"Good, Used to be Great","This used to be a strong contender in Austin. Still friendly, good location next to restaurants and bars, but the service has slipped. Staff are disinterested in helping once you’ve checked in. Stayed there three separate nights last week and the experience was the same each time.Valet personnel are great and eager to help and talk about Austin. It does have a fun feel and energy, but needs to understand personal service."
5,Great downtown location,Amazing suite with views and a deep soak tub and walking distance to hip Rainey Street bars and restaurants. And just a few more blocks to the 6th street downtown area. Excellent service from the moment we drove into the valet parking.
4,Company Party and Room,"We checked in Friday afternoon around 4pm to beat the crowd. The valet bell staff was attentive and pleasant. There were no line at check-in which was fast and efficient. We had requested an upgrade to a deep soak bath which was granted and a nice surprise. We were also offer complimentary beer and or margaritas upon check in via the lounge. Pretty cool.The room was well-appointed and spacious and a perfect room temp. We setup the room with a bar to host a few people before the company party. There was plenty of room for at least six people comfortably.The deep soak tub was amazing and shower was large had decent water pressure. We were happy with the accommodations and staff.Lastly, we did not eat at the restaurants or room service although we heard good thinks about their Sunday Brunch."
3,a 16 story hotel designed for loud parties - just want a nice room with peace and quiet,"We go to Austin often and this time decided to try a new hotel, the Hotel Van Zandt. On the slight pricey side but sometimes you have to try to see if it delivers. Unfortunately for us, our stay coincided with a series of parties being held in the hotel. I get that but you'd think that on the top floor you'd get some peace and quite. Not in this hotel. We also tried milling around the lobby tried the restaurant, which we liked, but it was also very loud. Our take on this place? You go there to party and join in the loud music and celebrations. If you are over 50 this place isn't for you."
5,Kimpton Van Zandt-Awesome Location!!,"Awesome location. Staff was very friendly & helpful. Cleanliness of the rooms is a huge plus. Really enjoyed the daily happy hour with free beer, margaritas, wine & small bites. The Kimpton is our go-to hotel when we travel. Love the pet friendly environment!!"
5,Great Austin Find!,Really liked this hotel. Big laid back lobby. The rooms were nice. Fun atmosphere. The restaurant could have been great but the servings were for the most part too small. Carrots are fine but not as an entree! Great live music nightly. Down the street from the hotel is a street full of laid back bars and casual restaurants. Fabulous people watching.
1,"Terrible, terrible party planners","We had reserved the “ living room” off of the lobby for a private party for 160 guests. We met with the catering manager TWICE in person at the hotel and discussed all details for the party including 2 full bars and lots of Christmas decorations provided. 40 minutes before the party we arrived to find NOTHING, NOTHING had been done to prepare. No bars, no roping off of the area... nothing. We found the staff person responsible and she said they just had too many events planed and didn’t have a bar for us. And we asked about the decorations. Where are they? They said everything was already out! We had paid over $6000 for this party and had nothing with lots of hustle on our part we had one bar set up as all of the guests arrived. We ended up with two bars before the one and one half hour was over. Sad, poor service. By the way. We spoke to 3 different directors for this party. Every time we met with or called the previous person was no longer there. Margot, Stephanie and one more."
5,"Best hotel in Austin, TX","This hotel is spectacular. It has beautiful decor, friendly staff, and an exceptional restaurant and lounge on the fourth floor. I stay at hotels hundreds of times every year, and this one ranks at the very top of my list."
3,Exorbitant parking and restaurant prices,"We were disappointed with our stay partly because of the exorbitant prices associated with the hotel amenities and partly due to the condition of the hotel. Valet parking (which we were told was the only parking option) was $48. Geraldines, the on-site restaurant, only served very expensive tapas for dinner. My mother, for example, had two small tapas for $55 and still left the restaurant hungry. (The lunch menu had things we would have preferred like a hamburger; we wished that had been a dinner option.) The room itself had dark decor, and there seemed to be a lot of scuff marks around the room. On the day of our departure, the elevators weren’t working, so everyone had to use the service elevator. (We understand things happen, so that actually bothered us the least.) Overall, this hotel just didn’t live up to what we were hoping to be a great stay."
5,Best of the Best,"Thanksgiving Week we were able to stay a few days at this lovely hotel! My husband and I have been fans of the “Kimpton Brand” when they first opened in San Francisco early 90’s. We truly appreciate the uniqueness of this boutique brand. Warm welcome from staff members, evening happy hour, great room decor and lovely beds, linens and bathroom essentials! Housekeeping was wonderful! Room Service was efficient and food yummy. We utilized the bikes offered and rode all around the lake and city.Kudos to the whole team! Fun to see Nik front and center and Lauren checking on the property!"
3,Overpriced hipster hotel,"Sadly disappointed about our stay at this hotel. This was a once a year holiday party stay for us. Rather than worry about the drive home after a party we booked a pricy room. We were excited about stay at the facility as Kimpton has long been associated with great properties. Sadly what we got was a small noisy room that wasn't much nicer than some La Quintas and Holiday Inns where we have stayed.The room was small (okay so its boutique). The wardrobe in the room wasn't even assembled correctly so the doors didn't close properly. The walls in the room were scuffed and the bathroom was a typical hotel bathroom but with a barn door. Yes it had a big shower but the water that came out of the shower head was so poor that it made for a quick chilly shower.Our room was situated next to a Jr Suite and could be added on to the suite as an additional room. Sadly the suite was booked by a girls party (could have been a bachelorette party). So when they ventured back to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning and stood outside our room we might as well opened the door and let them come in. Front desk should work on putting groups together. This is a room that should be kept empty unless the hotel is completely full.Dark corridors that seem to provide no sense of direction make it feel a bit like you are trapped in a Wes Anderson movie.The lake view room was fabulous as was the view from the hotel pool.I'm not going to talk about the banquet much because I don't know what was arranged but I will say if you are going to serve rolls with a meal then there should be butter available. This isn't the fault of the person that booked the facility but rather a banquet issue.For the price I'd rather stay at the 4 Seasons or the Ritz, for less a Hyatt had a nicer room. If you like overpriced hipster venues with themes and staff dressed like lumber jacks and longshoremen this is your place."
5,Family,"Right off the super cool area of Rainey St. We were there on a Monday and Tuesday night so it was pretty quiet. I imagine on the weekend it would be rockin! The pool are has a lovely view of the river and downtown area. Upon arrival a list of fun places to go, is at your disposal and most are within walking distance. The room was spacious and staff were super friendly. I"
5,One of the best spots in town,"Great place - stylish & fancy, friendly staff, live music, amazing pool site, in the middle of Austin only a footwalk away from lots of other hotspots. Compared to most other US hotels they try to avoid plastic bin"
5,Lovely stay,We enjoyed a two night stay while in Austin the hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful.We enjoyed the free beer in the lobby and the selection of music played on a fantastic record player.Hotel is ideally located and the rooms were large and the beds were very comfortable.Great place to stay.
5,AMG Expert Training Event / Excellent Service,"The Hotel property is beautiful, staff very friendly and accommodating, great location; in walking distance to the heart of Austin's downtown. Service was great! Rooms were immaculate and turndown every night made it feel like I had just checked in again to a fresh room. Great staff!"
5,My trip to Austin,"Hotel VanZandt is located in a nice area of down town Austin. It is nice and upscale hotel with professional staff. room was very spacious. Bathroom very clean and had stand up shower. with ""water fall"" shower head. Break fast was good. very tasty coffee. Live music was icing on cake. I highly recommend Hotel Van Zandt. Thank you for your service."
5,One of the very best...,What a fantastic hotel!I was there for 5 days on business and was lucky enough to score a corner suite on a high floor.One of the best hotels that I’ve ever stayed.The hotel is new modern & spotless. The decor reflects the Texan location and is very cool.The bars and restaurants are excellent and the service the entire time I was there was very friendly and efficient.I was even offered a beer when I checked in the evening!Everything you need in Austin is nearby - and you can walk home from the 6th Street area - live music Mecca.A must stay in Austin.
5,Fabulous hotel,This is a very fine hotel. We were treated well by all the staff who were very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a suite which overlooked downtown and the lake. We enjoyed the restaurants and the evening social hour. Our room was quiet and beautiful. The bathroom was great with a large walk in shower and a spa tub.
1,Bumped Us! for a large group,"We booked directly with The Van Zandt for 2 rooms for 5 nights over Thanksgiving many weeks ago when they had a sale on the rooms. Then 2 days before the trip we got a call from the sales manager saying that we couldn’t stay there and they messed up and a very large group had booked a block of rooms through another site. Of course I was mortified that they were kicking us out so close to our stay... never heard of this before! They did offer to put us up at the new Fairmont at a reduced rate in suites, but hey we booked The Kimpton for a reason and now I’m disgusted with them. We also had The Kimpton booked for a trip to San Diego in December and have plans to call corporate to complain. Should I cancel?L"
5,Outstanding,"Surprise milestone birthday for my husband in Austin with 4 other couples. What a great weekend and the hotel was spot on in all aspects of our stay! Highly recommend the hotel for location, service, friendliness. 👍👍👍👍"
5,A great getaway!,"A few days in Austin at this unique boutique hotel from Kimpton. I've stayed at the Miami hotel and this did not disappoint. Right on Rainey Street and a quick Uber or scooter away from everything, it's a perfect location. The hotel has a great restaurant, rooftop bar, fitness center, pool, ....the list goes on. A place to check out next visit."
5,Win! Win!,I hate to share this because I dont want to create too much demand! But... it is the best hotel in Austin in my view. Best combo of facilities and boutique quality with awesome location and service. I love this place. Hone away from home. Easy access to the city... Rainey st. and a quick hop to the river (lake??? Weird) for a bike ride.Picture is of a great room ..corner in the 01 line.
5,Gorgeous hotel + Walk to Great Food,Beautiful hotel with an amazing staff - very friendly and helpful. LOVED Cafe 605 and the awesome staff there - try the blueberry muffins!! Rooms are really nice and the bedding is beautiful. Highly recommend.
3,Pros and cons,"Whilst we really enjoyed the size of the bathrooms, the robes, the views, the happy hour, the fire, the bar and the live music. The location of the hotel was not ideal for us. It is right on Rainey street. Even if you get a high room facing away from the Main Street, you can still hear noise until the small hours of the weekend. Perfect for some but not necessarily for us"
5,The artisan bartenders are very special! ❤️,Some of the best craft cocktails in Austin in a lovely (typical urban chic) Kimpton hotel. The Willies Cup and Japanese whisky drink were truly extraordinary. And the bartenders are outstanding. Great date or biz place for a drink.
5,Great Hotel. Great Location.,"Weekend Birthday at Austin. Interesting lobby (as always with Kimpton Hotels). Great service, beds and concierge. Great location near Rainey Street historic district. Lots of restaurants, street food and pubs walking distance. Will repeat for sure and recommend."
2,"Looking for quiet, avoid this place.","We are huge fans of Kimpton hotels. They have great staff, wonderful food and good accommodations.However, in this case, this property is located directly across from a bar that blares bass LATE into the night.Asking for a quiet room on the 15th floor produces a late night review on TripAdvisor “I wish I stayed somewhere else.” Calling the concierge does not help.If you’re in Austin and out until 2am, this is a great option.However, if you’re over forty and want a hotel you can sleep in, avoid this place.I wish I stayed somewhere else."
3,It was not impressive for Platinum IHG elite member,We stayed at this hotel during busy times - F1 event. Check In was prolonged over 15 minutes and they refused to upgrade a room for me as Platinum IHG elite member. I got only $25 dining credit per our group stay. Thats all. Breakfast was overcooked and burnt sloppy becuase they cooked in rush badly. Bathroom and shower faucets are difficult to run and dysfunctional. Not impressive experience at all.
5,Conference 3-day stay,"Great hotel, great staff, very cool decor. Beautiful pool deck and bar / views. Comfortable bed, nice room. Would have liked to have a true lounge chair in the room. 2 chairs provided were dining, work, lounge hybrids and fine for the first two uses but not comfortable for just lounging / reading / TV watching."
5,Spontaneous get away,So much fun. We're back Oct 31st and bringing friends!!!The staff and service are exceptional. We were greeted by Nik and he just knew how to make our stay extra special. Our room was beyond beyond and oh my... the pool and bar were perfection. Can't wait to be back.
4,Beautiful property,"The property is stunning, loved the room, loved the pool bar and loved the wine hour. Location is good and i was able to walk to most places. I felt the reception staff could be a little more interested, they seemed a little robotic. However the bar staff made up for it."
5,Boutique,"Large boutique hotel. Nice rooms, good service, nice location. Front desk staff very helpful. Nice restaurant and coffee shop. Only issue was open shower without door which can flood floor if not careful. Nice happy hour where they serve free wine and Margaritas."
5,Another Great Kimpton Hotel,This beautiful hotel is well-situated in downtown Austin. No need to use a car here. Wine hour was great..they even had margaritas! Everyone who worked there was so nice to us. Would love to come back here again!
5,Customer Service,"I'm currently staying at the hotel and the room are beautiful, clean and cool. When our toilet started making a strange, trumpet like sound every 10 minutes, I visited the front desk to see what could be done. Within the hour Eric, the technician arrived and looked at the toilet. He promptly explained that he could fix it while I waited or be relocated to a new room. I selected the new room because I had to get ready for a meeting. In less than 10 minutes I had the bellman, Joshua at my door helping me move and apologizing for any convenience. You can't stop things from malfunctioning and this staff was all over making sure I wasn't inconvenienced. Well done, Kimpton!! Much appreciated."
5,Margarita hour in the lobby! Great location. Stylish! Nice Pool!,We loved this hotel in downtown Austin! Very stylish. The pool was great for lounging next to. The managers happy hour (delicious margaritas) was a reason to return every afternoon. The neighborhood is fantastic with lots of great dining options nearby. Wonderful stay in Austin!
5,Exceptional Service and Atmosphere,"Beautiful clean hotel. Very comfortable bed and guest areas. Service beyond expectations. Staff very accommodating, friendly and responsive. Lot's of things to do that is within walking distance of the hotel."
5,A experience you won't forget,My wife and I were in Austin for business and few vacation days. We enjoyed our experience at the Kimpton Van Zandt. Staff is very welcoming and nice. Slept very well. Beds are comfortable and food at Geraldine's is tasty. You should enjoy a praline latte at the Cafe 605. Many small attentions like the cocktail hour at 5h30PM and their doorman are extremely polite.
5,Wedding,The Hotel Van Zandt is over the top for a wedding! Beautiful with the best staff! Everyone was very attentive and was eager to help with every request. It couldn't have been any better! All the guests were also impressed!
4,Elegant location for wedding,"We attended an evening wedding at the Hotel Van Zandt. The decor and ambiance was lovely and elegant. All staff was helpful and friendly. The only negative was the food, but getting a plated dinner absolutely perfect for 200 is not necessarily the easiest thing to do."
5,I LOVE Kimpton!,I have stayed at many Kimptons and they are always consistent in their service and comfort. The Van Zandt is funky and fun! Great stay and Joe was very helpful getting the room taken care of. I strongly recommend this hotel.
5,Rock Star Staff,"We were treated like rock stars from the moment we booked this trip. Everyone we encountered was professional and made our 30th anniversary special. The corner king room was spectacular. Also, the free bikes, locks and water are fabulous. We did not even need a car! Geraldines brunch was a 5! Housekeeping went above and beyond daily with our room."
5,"Nice hotel, Excellent service","The hotel offers a really good location, the hotel restaurant was amazing but the best thing about my experience was the great service.Room and restaurant service are outstanding . The hotel service in general is amazing. I left my Air Pods in the room and the hotel found them and were willing to ship them to me to the UK. For some reason they accidently hand over my Air Pords to another guest and automatically emailed me to apologize and to offer the purchasing of a brand new pair of Air Pods.The Loss prevention Manager was really professional, providing and excellent customer services.Definetly the place to stay if you go to Austin !"
3,Room for improvement,"I stayed here for three nights. Decent, but I'm sure there are better in the area.Pros:Great location close to Rainey Street and the riverNicely decorated common spaces and lobbyStaff (particularly in the cafe) were greatNice amenities in room like an umbrella, yoga mat and robesGood sized gym with a good amount of equipmentCons:Music from nearby bars thumps into the evening and even the earplugs in the room don't helpCell service is bad within the roomsYou have to ask for a coffee maker for your room - this should be standard!Not enough places to hang wet towelsRoom for improvement with housekeeping - mysterious orange/brown lotion/liquid stains on bathroom floors and toilet base that weren't cleaned the whole time I was there - also random replacement of things like toiletries and towelsOverall, decent, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it for work travelers, given the lack of desk space in rooms (which is halved when you request said coffee maker and non-existent if you order room service) and the noise from nearby bars."
5,The only place I will stay in Austin,"I loved everything about this hotel. The staff is friendly and welcoming, the decor and vibe are exactly what I look for in a hotel. The rooms are clean and comfortable and it's a central location. I hope to visit again soon."
5,A great hotel,"Great location. Downtown, close to river and convention center. Complimentary water and beer at check-in. All of the staff were friendly and accommodating. Large rooms with very spacious bathrooms. Nightly wine and Margaritas at the free happy hour. Rainey street is right next door so dozens of restaurants and food trucks to choose from. I am a fan of the Kimpton hotels and this is one of their best."
5,Great Austin experience,"Staff went out of their way to be attentive and generous during our anniversary celebrating. Restaurant mgr worked hard and still remembered us at dinner. Entertainment for brunch and dinner great. Comfy room, could have been slightly larger and have a coffee pot so I did not have to go downstairs for coffee. however cocktails and coffee were delicious."
5,"Walk to the convention center, hang by the pool, borrow a bike...you can't go wrong!","Just off Rainey Street with quick access to Butler Hike & Bike Trail around Lady Bird Lake, this location is a great starting point for exploring Austin. Food trucks and established eateries abound in the Rainey Historic District and it's a short car ride, bike or scooter adventure into downtown. The pool deck affords a great view of Lady Bird Lake and downtown plus I hear the bar serves up the best drinks Austin has to offer. Room service was a bit off for early morning deliveries when serving convention guests but they made any small mistakes right, quickly. We'll be back!"
1,"Noise all night, bad service","I was there for a conference. I could not sleep all night. I was on the third floor heard loud rock music until 2am two nights Ina row. On the second night this was followed by furniture moving in the bar area above me for a couple of hours. They did move me but would not remove the room charge. The manager told me I was the only person to complain, but I found out several people in the conference were moved for the same reason the day before. In general service was less than impressive. No coffee in room, no WiFi provided free outside the conference room, doormen did not offer to help with luggage or even opened the door for me on arrival as was carrying my luggage in.Would refuse to be placed on a lower floor."
5,My favorite hotel in Austin!,"The vibe, the service, the hotel amenities - all excellent! I've had five stays there. They honor my requests for quiet rooms and go out of their way to be welcoming. Great decor. Pet friendly. Fun happy hours in the lobby! Enjoy!!"
5,Van Zandt exceeds expectations,"I had heard a lot about the hotel before I stayed so I had a high bar. I stayed for 6 nights so I got the whole dealio down. The pool is nice, pool bar and Geraldines were perfectly set, although didn't have great weather. There was a Mercedes event there for most of my stay where journalists from all over the world were there taking the protoypes for a spin. So it was cool having all these nice cars and international people there. That's just what you'd expect from a world class Kimpton."
5,beautiful hotel,"My daughter had a conference in Austin and I tagged along, the design of the hotel is stunning.We are not very demanding so we did not interact with staff much. Mind you the doorman was funny and enjoyed his sense of humour. The room was very comfortable and well appointed. The pool area was spotless and very comfortable, spent a lovely day out there."
4,"Beautiful, funky but...","This hotel is certainly beautiful and has a fun funky vibe. I loved the neighborhood and the staff seemed generally nice and attentive. A few notes: no one helped me get my very large suitcase out of the Uber when I arrived which seemed odd. I like the fact they took my mobile number and texted me several times to make sure everything was ok with my stay. Here is the only negative — there were no draws in my room. And while they did bring up draws they were so narrow I could fit nothing but a pair or two of underwear in each draw. Fitting for example work out clothes was impossible. My colleague on the other had did have draws in his room. I like to unpack, thus I would certainly recommend asking for a room with draws. The coffee shop in the hotel was a plus. Overall it is worth staying here!"
4,Austin Boutique Kimpton,"Good location. Hotel facility is very nice. The room and view is awesome. The restaurant Geraldine's was ok. Kinda of a limited funky menu - But is is Austin !!! The bar staff was a bit anemic as well, acted disinterested in general."
5,If You’re In Austin—STAY HERE!!!,"Perfectly located in downtown Austin and this boutique hotel fits Austin perfectly. Fabulous lobby with a great coffee shop but the real jewel is Geraldine’s restaurant on the 4th floor and the very hip pool on the other side of the glass. Live entertainment with various Austin musicians and an esoteric menu that’s fun to enjoy! BTW, a short walk to Rainy Street and all the debauchery one could ever want! #highlyrecommend (The pic below is a view from our suite on the 11th floor)"
5,Unapologetically hipster,"The room was clean and the staff were all friendly. I really appreciated the free coffee in the morning and made the most of happy hour (complimentary margaritas, beer, and wine from 5-6pm).The hotel was in a great location close to restaurants and downtown."
2,Ugly,"One of the ugliest hotels we have ever stayed in. Extremely unattractive and dark hallways. I must say that the staff was friendly but that is about the only thing that would make us recommend this Kimpton. No free wi -fi, loud music from adjacent restaurant\night clubs even though we were on the 10th floor. The farm door for the bathroom would not close. Definitely would not stay here again."
5,Cool hotel,"Stayed here for a weekend getaway. The location is great -- right on Rainey Street but close to other downtown attractions and the South Congress hotel. The hotel itself has a very modern feel. We booked a lake-view room with a spa tub, and it was worth it. Views of the lake were really nice, and the windows were huge, making the room feel bright and large (which it was). The bathroom was also large and very nice. The staff were friendly, and the restaurant/bar was incredible, with a great selection of liquors that you might not find at the average bar. We did not go down to the pool, but it was obviously popular. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Austin"
5,Pleasant and lovely all around,"We really enjoyed are short stay at this hotel. Friendly, aiming to please staff and very clean rooms. We enjoyed the very popular pool, great location and cool vibe. Another outstanding stay at a Kimpton property."
5,Very cool hotel in a very cool neighborhood,"This hotel is in the perfect spot to get the most out of Austin. Great pool, very friendly and attentive staff. It's now my favorite hotel in the city. The atmosphere is laid back and the views are great."
5,Best spot on Rainey St!,The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating! We really enjoyed being in the middle of everything. We took advantage of the BIRD and Lime S scooters to really see the city. It was great to see how bike friendly the city was. The happy hour was great! We got to meet other hotel guest.. .and being greeted with a beer at check in!!! I felt like we were staying at a very close local friends place! It was awesome! The decor was very much our style and vibe.
5,Another Home Run for Kimpton,"If you have stayed at a Kimpton Property then you know what to expect. Exceptional service, creative themed (yet understated) architecture and a superior dining experience. If you have not stayed at a Kimpton, you are in for a treat. You can find great rates if you keep an eye on it. The front desk service made sure I was accommodated and sent up a toothbrush and lotion that I had forgot to pack practically before I reached my room. Definitely visit the restaurant upstairs. They have a cocktail lounge surrounding the pool that is pretty nice year round. I went in January and it was still used.There is live music inside at the main bar and a very helpful bar staff to serve you their latest cocktail creation or the chef's tasty app of the day. I was presently surprised and grateful when the bartender whipped out a handmade double sided ""pamphlet"" with all the info I would want to know about Austin in a nutshell I literally lived by that thing it was so useful. The staff had included restaurants (by fare, type and location); things to do and see and seasonal activities. If you enjoy being pampered and a little quirkiness, go here. Keep it Weird!"
5,"Cool, fun Hotel, close to everything!","This Kimpton property is relatively new with a funky really cool vibe and modern feel to it! Overall loved the energy and style. Upon check-in we were offered either a water or a local Austin based beer, great touch! The pool is located on the 4th floor, nice size - lots of seating with a great bar that offers a fun drink menu. Our room, corner suite, had a soaking tub over looking the city. Loved the Atelier products too!Each night ""social hour"" stars at 5, basically a meet and greet with complimentary cocktails. The staff are knowledgeable and eager to assist with any need a definite recommend overall."
5,Treat of a stay,Great hotel and location. Friendly and hip ambiance as soon as you enter into the lobby. Staff are very attentive and eager to make your stay memorable. I would definitely stay here the next time I visit Austin.
5,Beautiful hotel,We really enjoyed our stay at the Van Zandt. The environment and friendly staff made coming home after long days in the Austin heat a pleasure. Comfortable beds well appointed rooms. The pool deck is lovely.
5,Great hotel in Austin,"Attending a conference in Austin at this hotel. Staff very friendly and knowledgeable, rooms nice and clean. Great bar staff. Wine and beer free during 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm daily. Pool and patio on 4th floor with nice views. Very close to some music venues and restaurants."
5,Amazing weekend,We were celebrating my daughter’s wedding and chose to stay here. It’s very centrally located and walkable distance to amazing Resturants.The hotel itself is awesome.We spend a lot of time by the pool and it was great. The food too was delicious.My sister forgot her jewellery in the locker and we were promptly informed about it.I highly recommend this hotel.
5,Completely satisfied and will stay again!,Very friendly staff and great restaurant on the 4th floor. Food and service was great. Located in a highly desirable area with a lot to do. Highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure. You won't be sorry!
2,Over hyped,"Nothing great about the room. The lobby was nice. It's really annoying that you have to pay for silly things like Wi-fi. If it's a luxury hotel you should get more amenities not less. Then, they tried to charge for things i did not order. Not staying there again.."
5,One of the best,"I cannot say enough about this hotel, it’s staff, rooms, restaurant, location. I honestly can’t think of a thing negative. Gorgeous views of the river from my suite with just an amazing soaking tub. I know there is a lot to choose from in Austin, but I highly recommend this place."
1,Too noisy; apathetic staff,"I get that this place in on Rainey Street, but holy crap, the noise. On one side of the hotel you get to hear all the noise from Rainey, and on the other you get to hear all the noise from the live music in the restaurant.And if that’s not enough for you, the clientele is awful and noisy too. 5 competing boom boxes at the pool, bachelorette parties running between rooms yelling, etc etc.Tried working with the front desk - nothing. Tried calling the general manager - nothing. Waste of $600 to stay here."
4,Trendy place to stay,"My wife and I had a getaway here, which isn’t terribly too far from our home. We booked the trip for this hotel on hotwire because we wanted a hotel we never stayed at and thought it would be fun adventure not knowing what we were getting. Little did we know it was the trendy hipster epicenter of Austin, Texas. The hotel was gorgeous with secure elevators, gorgeous features, and friendly staff. The hotel butts up near Rainey Street which has tons of food trucks, bars, and live music venues.Pros:Awesome rooms with every luxury you can hope for. Walk in showers, full bottles of shampoo’s, usb switches, robes, you name it.Breakfast request scheduled for the morning that you place on your door. That was super convenient and saved us time.Your valet has your car ready when you check out.Cons:No parking close by that I could find, valet service seemed to be the only option. This is costly at 48 dollars for one night.The scheduled breakfast was 47 dollars. It was good, but they charge 27% gratuity automatically for two people.Lastly, the night scene doesn’t stop till after 2am. I slept little till the “boom, tiss, boom, boom, tiss, boooom” stopped for the night. It shakes your soul through the walls from the streets below and from my neighbor to the left.Overall, great stay if you got a lot of money or had procured a great discounted stay(this guy) and like the trendiness that is downtown Austin.Lastly, drive safely downtown. Tons of electric scooters everywhere. They seem to be for rent all over and the riders seem to have little regard for the rules of road or wearing helmets."
5,Great location and very cool hotel,"Very cool property and super friendly staff. Easy walk to the convention center, and entertainment or just grab an Uber, Lyft or Taxi. Pool and pool deck is a great asset as well. The Grab and Go restaurant in the lobby is also a great option with very friendly staff."
4,Birthday Weekend at Local Luxury Boutique Hotel- PET FRIENDLY.,"What a interesting hotel to spend a special occasion. Check-In experience was awkward with the agent who checked-us-in, he literally made no effort to interact with us, or give us a standard check-in. Literally did not make any effort to make conversation with us, did not give us wi-fi or hotel information, but he made sure to read out-loud our room number when he gave us our key to the room, hotel was Fully-booked so we were put right in-front of the elevator a little after 4pm, with connecting rooms. It was my birthday, so the check-in did not make me feel excited about the hotel. Good-thing is that I did my best to enjoy it.The hallways are so dark, I actually could not see well, I am almost legally blind, so If I did not have my glasses, I would be lost in the halls, but it was sooo cute :) The shower is a half-glass shower, I did not like it, I felt bad for wetting the walls while showering.I love how Pet-Friendly they are, I just wish they offered dog-bowls, and or treats upon checking-in.We had a good time enjoying our cocktails at Geraldine's, waiter was kind, and the bar scene was nice. Staff needs to be more presentable with their outfits though, they were wearing a lot of torn clothes. Juana was so sweet in listening to my experience, and making me feel valued and for giving me a 12 PM check-out, I was too hungover to check-out at 11 AM, so that extra hour REALLY helped! The guest next door to us were throwing a party after 2:00 AM, but they quickly rectified that issue.Overall, it was a good experience. Thanks!"
5,Unique Property - Relaxed Setting,This is a truly unique property perfectly located in Austin. Rooms are comfortable and very clean. The staff is great from the front door to housekeeping. It’s a quiet hotel with an awesome restaurant and a truly extensive drink menu. It’s expensive but deals can be found.
4,Looking for a nice hotel to travel with a family dog,"Overall experience: 4 StarsHotel is very nice and convenient if looking to stay downtown or near Rainey St. Made reservations over the phone, lady I talked with was super helpful and nice. We brought our dog so wanted to make sure no restrictions. No extra to bring a pet, which is super nice! Got the Put it in Park deal, which was just a small upcharge to include valet. Pool and pool bar were both great!Negatives about our stay - no area for taking pets out or a green space. You have to go behind local bars to let your dog out. Understandable because of the area, but to be pet friendly and not have a green space is a bummer. When making reservations lady mentioned they will have a dog bed, water and food bowl in the room. Unfortunately, none of these were left in our room. Yet, another bummer.Lastly, when checking out we were charged with valet parking although we already paid the additional fee that was included in our package. Seems like comminucation isn’t clear across all departments. Although our dog was a hit in the hotel lobby, wouldn’t say this is the best place for bringing a family pet along."
4,Nice suite on high floor with terrific view,"The suite with views of both Lake Austin (sitting room view) and east towards I-35 (bedroom view) and Rainey street. Nice. Employees were helpful and, of course, one can walk throughout downtown from this hotel (although July weather can gin up a sweat). Recommend to any night owl given multiple bars are steps away."
5,Wonder on the shores of Town Lake!!!!,Excellent hotel with panoramic views!!! Excellent and friendly staff that are eager to help you enjoy your stay. Unique experiences and close to awesome restaurants and bars south of Cesar Chavez. Still within walking distance of Sixth Street!!!
5,Birthday weekend,"What a wonderful hotel! We loved every minute of our stay. From the start I could tell it was going to be a great stay. Valet was super friendly, the front desk was super personable and offered drinks while we waited. The room was extremely clean. The best part was Dylan, he handled loud neighbors and even sent up a fruit basket with a hand written note. Hospitality at it's finest!"
5,Trendy and Welcoming,"My first stay, but it won't be my last. The hotel and its facilities are trendy and modern yet quite welcoming. Valet staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Located in the heart of the up-and-coming scene of Austin!"
5,ANNIVERSARY IN LUXURY,This place is absolutely great! We celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary here and it was awesome. We walked into a room that had a personalized happy anniversary message and a bottle of champagne! A great personal touch. The customer service was excellent as well. The room was comfortable and within walking distance of so many happenings in the area. We will definitely be visiting again!
5,Great girls weekend,"Stayed at Hotel Van Zandt with a group of women. We loved Austin and certainly loved this hotel. This is an ideal location - steps away from Rainey, yet perfectly far enough to not hear the craziness (get a room facing the hotel pool).The pool was great, but you should get down there early if you want a seat or lounge chair. Also just a heads up during the afternoon the stone patio gets incredibly hot (no surprise there), so make sure you are wearing your shoes/sandals down to the pool. Also, it's not a huge pool, but it'll do as it's rather refreshing on a hot day in July.We also ate brunch at Geraldine's before our flight. The service was perfection (Amber!) and the food was fantastic. It wasn't inexpensive, but I thought still worth it for the service, and the scenery.The rooms are not huge, but they perfectly fit our needs. We enjoyed the showers and especially loved the toiletries provided, particularly the lotion!Check-in / front desk was a little slow, but it didn't detract from the experience. Our friends go to experience the happy hour, but we were never around the hotel to make it in time. We did however avail ourselves of the coffee bar in the morning.Overall, the decor and location really won us over! I only wish we were able to stay longer!"
5,"Wonderful, Dog-Friendly, Staycation Destination","We had an awesome staycation here this past weekend. From the moment we arrived at valet with our 3 year old pup, we were greeted with such genuine warmth. Everyone, I mean, everyone at the Van Zandt made us and especially our little four-legged baby feel welcome. In fact, our dog was the hit of the daily happy hour - so many people came up to us to pet her and talk to her. Speaking of, the happy hour was very nice - they offered several types of wines....get there early to grab a seat as they fill up fast! We ended up strolling upstairs and also to the café to enjoy our wine.Our room was very comfortable and modern - loved the bathroom! The mini bar was perfectly stocked...lots of goodies to choose from. The pool was a bit chilly, but had GREAT views of Town Lake and downtown Austin.The location is awesome, walking distance to so much - Rainey Street, Town Lake, and downtown sites. Again, compliments to the staff, very helpful in navigating some ""cut-throughs"" to Town Lake as well as bringing up our doggie pillow, bowls, and food for our pup.If you are in Austin, this place is so cool and dog-friendly (very Austin to say the least), come visit, you truly will not be disappointed."
4,Great stay during conference.,"The rooms were clean and nice. Everyone very friendly. Nice for business or couples, not so much for families.Parking is expensive, 42 night. Room rates are in the two hundreds, with no breakfast included."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"My husband and I just spent a long weekend at this hotel and absolutely loved it! The hotel is located in a great location just off of Rainey and is only a short walk to 6th Street. The entire staff was amazing! From check in to check out, this place takes care of you! We had a corner room that allowed us views of the city and Congress Bridge. We loved our room. I do wish the lighting at the sink was brighter which would have helped while getting ready. The concierge was on point with his recommendations for area restaurants, be sure and visit with them. We did valet and it was on the pricey side, but it is downtown Austin. The valets do an outstanding job of getting your car for you very quickly and this was in the extreme heat. We would stay here again and would encourage others too as well."
5,Girls weekend,"Took our mom on a girls trip to Austin, stayed here for 2 nights. Just as wonderful as expected-have literally NEVER been disappointed with a Kimpton! Rooms were great, staff was awesome, location was perfect, pool area was amazing! Decor was cool-one of the staff saw us checking out a room and he took the extra time to show us his favorite area and we greatly appreciated it. Margarita at check in-Stay here! ...Or any Kimpton for that matter."
5,Fantastic!,"As soon as I reached my room I received a text from Mateo, the concierge. He wanted to make sure everything was ok and wanted to know if I needed anything. I received a text daily. The place was impecable! They offered a free happy hour from 5-6. The staff was friendly and professional! We had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. The food is gourmet! Small portion but delicious!Their bedding and pillows were beyond perfection. It was hard to leave the bed in the morning."
4,Modern Comfort & Southern Charm,"The whole room, including the bathroom, was very clean. The decor was tasteful and comfortable and should appeal to a wide audience. All of the staff I encountered were friendly and personable. The mini bar was jam packed with just about anything you could want, but the downside to that was there really wasn't room for the few small items I brought with me that I wanted to keep cold. My only real complaint was the amount of time I had to wait every time I needed the elevator. Despite 3 elevators for 16 floors, it appeared that only 2 were ever running, and I don't think I ever waited less than 5 minutes. Not terrible, but when you are trying to get to business meetings, it adds an unnecessary layer of stress. That said, I would go back to this hotel next time I have a trip to Austin. Especially a leisure trip."
4,"Great location, comfortable and fun","This hotel is well placed to walk around the music/bar district as well as downtown, convention center, along the river. It has a comfortable, roomy ambience and offers extras, like the use of bikes and a free cocktail hour."
4,"Perfectly appointed hip hotel, but a little loud","Hotel Van Zandt is super cool. The room was incredibly comfortable, clean and the aesthetic was hip but comfortable. I do think the hotel is a little crowded and really more for young-ish people without kids. Big party scene by the pool in the afternoon, but fun and the hotel security made sure to keep it fun, but not overly crazy. Food was good, the hamburger we got was AMAZING!! Drinks were also good and when we got one that wasn't, they switched it out no questions asked!! Staff super friendly and nice. I would just say that this hotel is suited for people who are looking for a fun and raucous weekend vs. mellow, family time. I was there for a girls weekend, so it suited us perfectly!! The HH is the best deal in town!! Free drinks from 5-6!!"
3,Too cool for school,This is a leisure hotel and not set up with the business traveller in mind. The Reception staff were helpful but haughty. The concierge staff failed to deliver on numerous occasions and had to be followed up continuously. Breakfast was suitable for those with plenty of time looking for a weekend brunch not for a busy business traveler in a hurry. The room service was hit and miss. The lifts took forever. Resting on its laurels with an arrogant attitude rather than a customer service focus.
2,Expected More - Crowded and Hot,"The hotel, overall, was nice but just wasn't able to justify the cost. The bike that were supposed to be in the lobby were always checked out so we never got to enjoy that amenity. The room never cooled down to a comfortable sleeping temperate (both my wife and I were sweating at night). You would think that this hotel knows what Texas summers are like and would invest in better in-room air conditioning.One of the most upsetting parts of the stay is how crowded and unavailable the pool is. We went stayed here mostly due to how nice the pool looked in pictures, and while beautiful, it was constantly crowded to the point where we were unable to get seats.For $270 per night, you would expect more from a hotel. If the hotel is able to straighten these issues out, we would definitely love to return. I am unsure if we stayed during an extremely busy time which would explain the lack of bikes and crowded pool. The AC unit may have been a fluke as well which I am inclined to believe due to the number of great reviews but it just definitely what we expected.Hopefully, we can give it another try and get to enjoy all the amenities."
4,Kids Away Allows Parents to Play,"We are Austinites but rarely get to enjoy our own city so we thought a 3 day staycation was in order to reconnect with our beloved city. HVZ is a great hotel for the price. By comparison, our neighbors joined in on the staycation fun; however, stayed at the Fairmont, which was the same price. If we wouldn't have spent time at the Fairmont, I would've given HVZ five stars. I can relate to some of the other reviews that felt like 40+ might find Fairmont more to their liking, while 40 and under might better enjoy HVZ. Dings on HVZ for me were the dark color tones, no coffee machine in the room and slower than expected turnaround on the request for extra pillows. To start, front door service and hotel staff were amazing at HVZ. A local beer was offered at checkin, which was a nice touch. The color tones of our room were darker, more muted than Fairmont, which are super bright blue and white. We did not have a coffee maker in our room which was disappointing but they have a great breakfast place downstairs. The pool is small at HVZ compared to Fairmont and a lot of chairs are still in the shade until noon-ish. The shampoo, conditioner and body wash are all amazing and smell great. My wife loves them pillows so she called the front desk to request a couple more. It took almost an hour to get the pillows, a bit longer than we expected. My wife said she slept great though. We spent most of the days and nights away from the hotel hitting the bars, museums and eateries. If you are reading this eat dinner at Emmer and Rye, a new favorite. Check out went as smooth as check in and the front house gang is amazing. Holding doors, flagging down rides, getting us loaded and situated for our 17 minute ride back home ;-). Great experience."
5,"Hip, friendly hotel in fabulous neighborhood","This hotel has it all. Friendly, helpful staff, wonderful, hip ambiance - near everything Austin has to offer. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. The pool, bar and restaurant are welcoming and fun to hang out at. They have a social hour everyday from 5-6 that puts everyone in a great mood (free wine and specialty cocktail of the day). The lobby space is a great place to enjoy a drink, read a book, meet up with friends or enjoy great music. Cafe 605 is a great spot to enjoy coffee, breakfast or afternoon snacks. Love, love, love this hotel!"
5,One Night Stand,"I had a free hotel night I had to use or lose so, I chose to stay at the Van Zandt. The customer service was what I expected out of a hotel the class of Van Zandt. As others have stated it's a good location with Rainey St. and the lake right there."
5,Hip Hotel,"Drove up from Houston for a weekend get away with the family. Arrived in Austin early and called to see if we could check in early. Much to our surprise, not only was a room available but they upgraded us to a Studio Spa room. Thank you Autumn! The staff is very helpful and attentive. The pool had a good vibe and the food was flavorful. The room had two queen beds, a sleeper sofa and two televisions. The bathroom was large with a walk in shower and a large soaking tub. The Social Happy Hour was a great event where we met many hotel guest and their pets. Rainey street is bustling with food, drinks, music and people. The only downside is the overnight parking fee, but do not let that stop you from staying at this hip hotel. If you want to make up for the parking fee, take advantage of the social happy hour where drinks are free for one hour!!!!Cheers!!"
5,Lady Bird Views!,"We had a great stay at the Van Zandt for a short summer get away. Our room was amazing with beautiful views of Lady Bird Lake. We had a very large spa tub, which was fabulous!The pool gets very crowded since it is not very large. The gym is nice and has a lot of equipment. Room service food is just okay. This hotel is geared towards a younger crowd. Rainey street is right next to the hotel. We did get an amazing kids welcome gift and my daughter had a blast. Had nice walks to Lady Bird Lake. Customer service was superb! A+"
5,Excellent hotel in Austin,"Location is great; close enough to walk to food, entertainment, the lake. Great pool, but we learned we had to get there early to make sure we got a seat. Room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Customer service was excellent. The 605 was convenient for coffee, breakfast, snacks. Loved the fruit-infused water available at the 605 and lobby. Great happy hour. Highly recommended."
5,True Austin style weekend getaway!,"Great Austin Texas style hotel. Beautiful pool area and outside bar Hotel staff is amazing and will go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying everything about your stay. Dog friendly and if you let them know in advance, they will have everything you need for your pet waiting for you in your room."
5,"the good, the loud and a suggestion",Overall this hotel is excellent. The vibe is definitely young and seems many young party groups come to this hotel since it is literally around the block from Rainey(sp?) and all the bars. We have a son that just moved to Austin and had a nice weekend visit. Our suite was furnished well. Nice fruit basket greeting The staff is exceptional. Everyone we came in contact with was professional and ready to help. When I received a text asking about how visit was going I expressed concern about noise the night before. Music from Rainey will last until 2am. They quickly offered to move us higher or give us a white noise machine. We used the machine. Suggestion: Why don't you have a noise machine in each lower floor room. The only complaints this hotel receives is the noise at night. We slept perfectly the second night ....Machine was great:) We used the cafe/ restaurant and gym....all excellent Bottom line : This hotel is really good.....just be prepared to deal with the noise and all will be perfect
5,"Beautiful hotel, welcoming and professional staff!","This was my second stay at this hotel and it has quickly become one of my favorites when in Austin. The staff is friendly, professional and very helpful. They are service oriented and made sure my stay was a great one! The rooms are clean and well laid out. Very accommodating for getting some work done, or simply relaxing. I look forward to my next visit."
4,"Beautiful, great location if under 40","The hotel was clean, beautiful and the staff were very helpful and well-mannered. We had brunch at Geraldine’s restaurant. It was excellent. However, the location a block of Rainey Street means this is a hotel that caters to a younger crowd. The food and social scene is focused on the under 30 crowd and those who still think they are. If you are over 60, it’s the difference between being a Phish fan instead of a Greatful Dead fan. Same idea, different generation. 5 Star if under 40, 4 Star if over 60."
5,First rate!,"We had an exceptional time. The hotel aims to be unique and it did not disappoint, from the bell person unis, to the cafe, the restaurant and the pool. The staff is well informed and very helpful.We would definitely return and highly recommend choosing this hotel. Great location as well."
5,Fantastic staff,My family stayed here for 4 nights during a family wedding nearby. The staff was amazing. From the doorman running over with cold water after returning from a scootering outing to the front staff sending me a margarita to my room because I just missed happy hour...the staff goes out of their way to make you feel like you are on vacation. The hotel is beautiful and modern. The hotel is steps away from all of the restaurants and bars on Rainey st. The hotel's restaurant serves delicious food and also has a great charming staff. My only complaint is that only free coffee/tea is available in the am...no food items. They do have a small cafe on property but when in a rush it would have been great just to grab a muffin and go and not have to wait on a line to buy something. We also had a minor issue with towels/housekeeping but the front desk took care of the issue quickly. All in all..a great experience.
5,Really nice,"We had a great time at this really nice hotel, we loved the hotel lobby, alive with energy and the free happy hour with a live dj and spinning vinyl records. Had fun at the pool which had a lot of fun people, this is a great location for people watching and walking to Rainey Street"
5,"Great Stay, everything you need","Pool was nice, although got very crowded and seats were taken quickly. The restaurant was great and live music at the bar. The location to Rainey street was perfect. Rooms were big and clean. Would stay again."
5,Amazing customer service!,"My 21 year old daughter and I just checked out after a 3 day stay. The hotel is very nice but I can’t say enough about the great customer service from valet out front, to waitresses and front desk staff. We will definitely stay again."
1,Inexcusable!,"I had a reservation to stay at the Van Zandt for one evening for work travel. When I arrived at about 10:30pm, the front desk manager told me that they were ""over sold"" and had no rooms available for me (despite my reservation! I know this is not his fault - it is an operations issue that someone at Kimpton needs to fix). I travel almost every week, and this has never happened to me. While accommodation was made for me to stay down the street at another hotel, this should never have happened. Why the hotel could not have notified me a few days in advance (or even a few hours!), I don't understand. For what it's worth, I had just started to add Kimpton to my rotation, but will no longer stay at their properties. Very stressful start to my trip."
5,Wonderful property. .great location,First class hotel with great amenities. Roof top pool bar with an amazing view of Austin. Don't miss the sunsets. Staff was very attentive. The hotel is located next to a trendy area full of small bars and restaurants. Many places are cigar friendly. The hotel has a coffee bar that makes a very nice cappuccino.
2,Horrible Reservation Management,"Beautiful property with terrible reservation management. The hotel sent me an email confirmation for 6/17/18 to 6/21/18. They kicked me out on 6/19/18 since their reservation had that checkout date. When I showed them the confirmation email which came from their email domain, they offered no apology, consolation or compensation. Instead, they just blamed the hotel that sent them the overflow reservation, billed my card and sent me on my way. At they very least, if they were using different resrvation information, they should have sent me an updated, corrected confirmation. Instead, I received a text message on 6/19/18 while working the trade show floor for my event indicating their surprise that my bags were still in their room. Well, imagine my surprise! At any rate, I won't be staying with them again. No matter how nice the hotel might be, if your reservation system can't be trusted, no thanks! Too many other things to deal with on business trips. Get it together!"
5,Trendy but great hotel,"While I didn't feel like I fit in with the ""vibe"" of the hotel (its a bit hipster), I enjoyed my stay. The staff (front desk, valet, others) were very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. The pool was very small, more for sunning than swimming (again, hipster). THe hotel allows pets and we saw many dogs during our stay.We stayed in a regular king room and our shower didn't have a door (which is standard). My only request would be that they would put a shower door on as it can get drafty in the shower.I loved the text service. Rather than calling the front desk, I could text the hotel for any questions and get our car out of valet. Responses were always sent within a couple minutes.It was a little pricey for me (we were here for my sister's bachelorette party), but overall I really enjoyed my stay."
4,Van Zandt,"Very nice hotel. Service, cleanliness and appearance of hotel were very nice. A bit pricey, but overall I enjoyed my stay. The pool is very small but we didnt spend much time there. Geraldine's has some unique food and drink options."
5,Amazing view,"WE upgraded for a corner suite, but then decided that the view was not to our taste. We switched to the river view and couldn't have been happier. The room was amazing. Quiet, and comfortable. We prefer Kimpton Hotels just because it ads a little bit of a home feeling. You walk out of the hotel and you are in the middle of one of the best party destinations. Rainey St. This is a sleeping giant that comes awake at night. Only one bar was open. Bangers and it was packed. When the sun goes down, watch out...This place rocked!"
5,We will be back!!!,They offered us beer or water upon arrival and it only got better! The rooms were nice and they will bring you anything you might need or forgot! Robes in every room and great walk in showers! The social hour was nice and the music was a treat! They sent me a text to make sure everything was fine and the entire staff was eager to please. The gym was small but had good equipment— needs to have some sanitizer and towels to wipe things down but that was the only negative. Pool area was nice in the evening and the bar stayed open late! A pleasant experience from check in through check out!!
1,Terrible Customer Service,"My husband and I stayed at the Van Zandt recently. While it's a nice hotel, with friendly staff, we were alarmed to find that after check out we were charged $165 for a blue tooth speaker that they claimed had been removed from the room by us. We explained that we were unaware there was a speaker in the room and certainly didn't remove it from the room. The hotel staff told us that the matter would be referred to their housekeeping staff. We contacted the corporate office to voice our displeasure at being accused of stealing from the hotel and received a reply stating that the matter would be referred back to the hotel management.if you're going to stay at this hotel, do yourself a favor and insist on having a staff member sign off on each of the room amenities when checking in and again when checking out. Or better yet, stay somewhere else when visiting Austin TX!"
4,Neat Place!,"Decided to do a last minute trip to Austin for the weekend to celebrate my husbands bday 6/8 and mine 6/9. Overall, I give this hotel a 4.5.Pros:* Great location next to Rainey street which is filled with really neat bars and food trucks.* Comfortable Beds* Very dog friendly (even gave us a toy, poop bags and some treats upon check in)... and all the staff just love the pups!* Valet guys are super nice* Great breakfast tacos at the downstairs restaurant* Ordered room service one night and it was very good... especially the french fries.Cons:* Shower is odd.. the water goes everywhere* For $375 a night ... would think the room would have been nicer. Wouldn’t say it was at a 5 star level* They serve coffee for free everyone morning, which is great, but they were out of milk and creamer and I waited for over 20 min and he still didn’t bring it so I just went to the restaurant & bought it* We weren’t a fan of the hotel restaurant Geraldines.Here’s what won us over. When my husband booked the hotel, they told him we would have free breakfast however once we got there, they said that wasn’t true. Not a huge deal because we aren’t big breakfast people anyways, but still. We left for the day and when we came back to our room, there was fruit, juice and 2 breakfast bars with a very sweet note saying apologies for the miscommunication. That was SO SWEET and I love any hotel that goes the extra effort to apologize and shows that they truly care.I would definitely stay here again. Great job Kimpton Van Zandt!"
5,Incredible place and incredible service!,"Not only is the hotel itself fantastic - huge and stylish rooms, lovely entry, but the staff go above and beyond to cater to your every need. They have complimentary coffee in the mornings and happy hour in the evenings. Everyone is so friendly and helpful, the doormen will literally run to the doors to open them for you (even in 100 degree heat!), the concierge is always happy to help, and the bar tenders at the pool are great fun. Truly a fabulous hotel - cannot recommend it enough."
4,Solid property located near bike path and good food options,"We were able to pay a little extra to upgrade to a higher floor with a view to the lake, and enjoyed the pool and adjacent bar area one afternoon. The hotel has bikes available, and we used them to ride to the LBJ Library and to the nearby bike path along the lake."
5,Awesome,"This was the second time I stayed at the Hotel Van Zandt and everything about it was wonderful - the atmosphere, the food, the service and the location. I can't say enough about it - the walkability in the area to restaurants and musical venues is very appealing."
5,Mix of authentic Austin and downtown luxury,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in, especially for a business trip! Since I was in town for work, I needed some business amenities. My room was the perfect mix of business meets relaxation - the staff brought me everything I needed (including a coffee machine at 5 a.m. as the rooms do not come with them!).I slept great, had fast internet access and really enjoyed the room. LOVE the proximity to Rainey Street (literally a block away) where I could explore new bars and restaurants on my nights off. I also really enjoyed the pool (arrived on Sunday) - fantastic service from the food to the delicious Mezcal cocktails! My co-workers were pretty envious; will definitely stay here my next time in town!"
3,Poor customer service,"We stayed at the Van Zandt to celebrate a birthday over Memorial Day weekend. I have to say, the biggest disappointment was the poor customer service. It started at check-in and continued throughout our 3 day stay to check-out. There was a lack of communication, inconsistent communication, and no sense or urgency. All things you would not expect from such a beautiful and high end hotel. I have worked in the customer service industry for close to 20 years and that's the one thing alone that drives why I stay at certain hotels, eat at specific restaurants, and where I choose to spend my money. The choice was to stay at the Van Zandt or across the street at The Fairmont. The Fairmont has always been consistent in the level of service and quality of the property/amenities. I thought the Van Zandt would be comparable. It was not and caused a lot of unanticipated stress during our stay. I can't help to wonder how much better our first time visit to Austin would've been if we had a better experience with our hotel. Again, the property is beautiful, but their customer service is not to par. We thought we'd get for what we paid for, but we didn't. Almost every different person we spoke to at the front desk had a different answer to the same question and/issue. It was very frustrating and even more that it didn't even help to speak to a manager. I expect for a manger's role to be accommodating and help find resolutions. Not the case here."
5,Awesome Experience with the Pups,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights with our 2 dogs over memorial weekend. We booked a standard King and when we arrived they were sold out of our room and upgraded us to a Lakeview Corner Suite on the 15th Floor. The room was plenty big and we had a view of Rainey Street on one side and a view of the Lake and South Congress bridge on the other. Our dogs were treated like queens. Upon arrival they gave us dog treats for the both of them. It was also social hour and we were offered a drink of our choice as well.A few things to note...customer service is exceptional. Thank you to all the hard working employees that made our stay great.We do wish we could have enjoyed the pool more during our stay but the hotel was at full capacity and people did that thing of placing a towel on lounge chairs early in the morning and then not arriving to the pool until after 2pm. So chairs sat empty for hours when we could have been using them. To me that’s unacceptable.The hotel is a very busy one, especially being close to Rainey. Just know that going in if you are bringing children or dogs that are not social.Overall fun experience and a good place to stay the night to experience Austin."
5,"No questions asked, best hotel to stay at! Location, customer service, hotel atmosphere, everything was wonderful!","During our one night stay, we were able to stop by the pool twice, which is very nice and had an awesome waitress named Morgan! She was super helpful w/ night-life suggestions and cool things to check out around town so make sure to ask for her!We were only staying one night before moving into an Airbnb for a bachelorette weekend and a gentlemen working at the front desk by the name of Adam, so graciously sent us a couple bottles of complimentary champagne, flowers and a sweet note. It made our day!! Overall, the experience was wonderful and I will definitely be back!"
5,Super Pleasant and Perfectly Situated,"This Kimpton property is a gem of a place. The lobby is always very clean and the staff exceptionally friendly. Love the large area for socializing and sharing during coffee, tea and newspapers in the morning or the wine hour in the evening. The breakfast menu has innovative and tasty choices. The pool is a bit small for the size of this property but very relaxing with many lounge chairs and nice cabanas if you wish to reserve those to avoid the brutal heat. The views from the rooms are great if you're looking toward Lady Bird Lake with nice sunsets. Valet service is quite nice but parking is super expensive for anywhere but especially Texas at about 45 bucks. Parking around here is expensive everywhere so be forewarned...it's walking distance to the nicely renovated Rainey Street with all the ranch style houses and cool restaurants. Best choice is to listen to the workers and get some exercise and park on the other side of the I-35 underpass (a short 10 minute walk) with loads of street parking for free. Loads of great little eateries and innovative food trucks on Rainey and live music. A short drive or Uber to the 6th St festivities if you're into that. Also, super easy to get onto I-35 from here. Finally, the rooms were always clean and fresh. Highly recommended."
5,Great Stay,"Just completed a weekend stay and very much enjoyed this hotel. This hotel is in a great location near a lot of action and easy walking distance to restaurants and attractions in the downtown Austin area. This hotel chain was not long ago added to the IHG brand so was great could book a upscale hotel with rewards points. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and service is very prompt. Thanks Dylan for the great recommendation on the Elephant Room, we really enjoyed it. The rooms had great views and the hotel was very modern and stylish. Housekeeping could be better but overall a very good hotel. We will definitely be back."
5,Amazing views from the top!,"We stayed in a corner room on the 16th floor and enjoyed amazing views of Austin looking to the west along Lady Bird Lake (the Colorado River) and to the north along I-35. The bed was comfortable and the room clean, modern, and comfortable. WiFi is not free for guests unless you are a member of the IHG rewards program, and in this day in age when internet is ubiquitous and almost considered a standard utility like hot water or electricity, it seemed a bit petty to charge for basic internet access. This is about the only negative I can think of from our 3-day stay. The rest of our experience was fabulous. The hotel staff and concierge Autumn were very friendly and helpful. My wife was easily able to request that her pumped breast milk be stored in the hotel’s freezer to keep it fresh. We ordered “in-room” breakfast every morning (hey, we were on vacation!) and although we found the coffee to be a little weak, the food itself was delicious, filling, and delivered on time with a smile. The hotel does a nice happy hour in the lounge by their lobby with a real record player that plays music. Very relaxing. We were walking distance to many Austin attractions (the Congress St bridge for free-tailed bat viewing, the 2nd St shopping district, Rainey St and Red River St districts for BBQ joints, live music, good beer (check out Blue Owl Brewery in East Austin) and even a late-night tattoo on 6th Street for my wife who loved the bats so much she had to get a bat silhouette inked on her leg!) For excursions beyond walking distance, Ubers are easy to get within 5 minutes from the Van Zandt. Really, we were thrilled with our stay at the Van Zandt and would recommend it for a relaxing stay to anyone."
5,Great Experience - Great Views!,"Met a coworker for breakfast and meeting. Greeted promptly by valet. Very courteous and friendly. Food in restaurant was unique and very tasty. Beautiful setting and service was great. Wanted to thank and recognize, Will, in valet as he was extremely friendly and prompt. Thank you!"
3,Quick stay,"Hotel was beautiful, nice atmosphere. The pool and outside patio was amazing. I was really wanting a hot tub, but they don't have one.. I asked for a quite room because I needed a good night sleep. I was told my room would not be able to hear noise from the outside clubs and bars, but it was loud."
5,Hello Austin!,"Just arrived! Wife and I reminded again why we love the Kimpton Brand. The concierge Autumn, is a delight. She brought us in out of the heat, got us a beverage, checked us in and made dinner reservations!Top floor. Big tub. Bigger room.Thanks Autumn for keeping the excellence alive."
5,Love this place,"Located right in the heart of Rainey Street, this boutique hotel was awesome right from the moment you pull up. Service is quick and professional and followed up with a text message to ensure everything is perfect. The pool area was a great place to spend a hot Texas afternoon, spotless clean, excellent service and food and beverage. The rooms are new and well maintained and very quiet for a great nights sleep. Free coffee service from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. and free beer and wine from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily, and is a great place to meet some new friends.We had lots of interaction with Van Zandt staff member Gretta, who treated us like family. We had some questions and she professionally and courteously answered them correctly on the first try, and we felt like we were the only people she had to help that day.We'll be back!!!"
5,All-around AMAZING,"This is one of the most modern-gorgeous hotels with exceptional staff I have ever experienced. We had a corporate event there and the staff was terrific to work with, the accommodations were stunning/comfortable and the service was excellent.I normally don't stay at high-end hotels for my personal travel, and this was beyond even what I am used to for business. A few things which stood out:- Location is right next to Rainey St, the hot bar area of Austin. Literally, around the corner there's a ton of great places to go.- Everyone at the hotel was polite, kind and thoughtful, from the doormen to the front desk and event staff.- The extras really stood out: music (live and records) during happy hour in the lobby, with free drinks.- Stunning design in the lobby, banquet rooms (yes, not boring banquet rooms!) and guest rooms- I was able to text the staff to ask about a toiletry I forgot and they delivered it to my room - that kind of easy option.Sincerely, if you want a great place to stay, this is it. One word of caution: because it's next to a street with a lot of late night bars, and if you are a light sleeper, it may be worth asking if you can have a room on the opposite side. That's as close as a"
5,Perfect for a GIRLS TRIP!,"We recently had a group of 12 girls stay at this property for a girls trip. The rooms were clean and comfy! Overall, a great location to all the hot spots and would def. recommend to stay there again!"
2,Great location but the service doesn't measure up,"As Kimpton has grown under IHG, it seems like they haven't invested accordingly in staff training and other best practices. Our preferred room type, a suite, wasn't available upon check-in so we accepted a downgrade and $50 credit. We returned from a long, hot hike in the hill country and were looking forward to a dip in the pool, only to have it closed because of a private event. We wanted to have breakfast at Geraldine's on the last morning of our stay and again, were disappointed to find it closed for a private event without any advanced notification to hotel guests. I had to prompt the front desk person to ask for my feedback upon checkout, as she was happy to let me go on and leave the property without asking me about my stay. The location is great, but if the Hotel VZ doesn't upgrade its logistics and staff, I imagine that I - and folks like me - will upgrade to the new and nearby Fairmont or downgrade to the Holiday Inn - this experience wasn't worth the price of a four-star hotel."
4,Fun Hotel,"I stayed here with friends for a girls trip. It was over a weekend so very busy. I’ve stayed at a Kimpton hotel before and there is a fun and modern vibe. The hotel staff were all nice and helpful. I loved the coffee shop! Great coffee and good for a quick breakfast. The baristas were awesome!The restaurant has great food and the pool/ pool bar are fabulous. It was crowded especially since their were two weddings staying there. I liked the music and good choices for pool drinks. Not a place for kids which for my trip worked out.My room was nice. It was near the elevator so it was on the loud side. I could also hear loud sports from the room next door at 2:00 a.m. I guess it could have been worse. So not a quiet hotel, but the location and all of the other positives out weighed it. Maybe during the week it’s not as loud? I would stay there again! So close to lots of bars and restaurants. A quick cab ride to Congress Street."
3,Solid Austin Hotel,"Great hotel, excellent rooms, you will hear a bit of noise from Rainey street based on room location and floor which could impact your sleep. Geraldine’s Restaurant is excellentwith a great menu and drink selection."
5,Boutique hotel with outstanding rooms,"The hotel was just amazing. The check in experience was quick and accurate. The décor of the hotel was spot on for the Austin, TX enthusiast. Happy hour in the hotel every night is an added plus!! The hotel restaurant is one of a kind as well. Great stay! The rooms are comfortable and felt like home."
5,Awesome. Close to everything.,"Great hotel near the convention center. Staff is all on it.Don't miss the coffee every am and included 5 to 6 PM drinks. They have specialized cruiser type bikes for loan without charge which is an awesome way to ride the boardwalk around the lake.One thing to keep in mind is a 43$ or so overnight parking fee. Even if you plan on dining a ways a way or play disc golf it may be cheaper to uber or cab it. The vehicle plus parking plus tips ran about 400$. Just a thought.Back to the hotel. Rooms were great, clean. If you care, one side of the hotel faces Rainey street and on the weekends will be load with the base from the music coming right through the walls. I don't mind but you might"
5,Great Hotel...,"Great Hotel with a fantastic view, location & easy to get around town. Employees were awesome & took pride in there jobs. Security was in place & it felt like a safe place to stay. Restaurant was 1st class with food to match. Exceptional bar with drinks made from scratch."
5,Great customer Service and rooms!,"We celebrated my Mom’s 70th here. The staff made us feel welcome and special with great welcome treats in our room. The rooms were great and a shout out to Autumn at the concierge, she was accommodating and was super helpful (all staff was great). I love Kimptons because of their great properties, amenities and location, their perks (bikes, social hour, pool and restaurants) are always awesome! I will recommend this property and hope to come back. Thanks for the great stay!!"
4,Balanced Review......,"There are things to like and things some may not like.This is a nice property. It's not a luxury hotel, but it's very nice. The rooms are pretty ordinary, as are the public spaces.What sets this apart is the edgy, hip crowd, location next to Rainey Street and the fun evening margarita offerings where many of the guests are in the lobby at the same time. These are the things that transforms a rather ordinary property into a destination venue.We will be back."
2,"Noisy, room not cleaned","Room not ready when I checked in at midnight, 8 hours after check in time. Told it was ready but...ironing board left outsecond iron on the desk, one in closetrobe, looked used, on hook in the bathroom,half-full water bottle, not hotel brandHairdryer. plugged in, left on the counterone item missing from the mini bar*Did give me $25 food creditALSO noisy, like a frat-party right outside the front door every night"
5,Fabulous Stay,"The location and amenities are excellent but what puts this property over the top is the outstnading service. The manager, Joe was very attentive. Highly recommend the restaurant, Geraldine's as well."
5,Awesome vibe & location.,"Had the pleasure of visiting Austin for the first time, and chose HVZ for it's location and our loyalty to the chain. Rooms are great & dining options are super nice. It does sit right over Rainey St, which is quite the nighttime party zone. We did not however have an issue with street noise, but we did request a high floor room just in case. Walkability into downtown and the riverfront walking trails was perfect. Also right off of interstate, so easy access off/on freeway was super fast. Super friendly staff and that aimed to please on all fronts."
5,Excellent staff makes for an excellent hotel,"This is a modern, clean and well tended-to full service hotel. There is a beautiful river view from the pool deck and the hotel is within a short walk of an assortment of restaurants, bars and music venues.From the perspective of a full time wheelchair user, the Kimpton Van Zandt has made every accommodation to make a mobility impaired guest feel welcome. The accessible rooms have wide doors,perfect roll-in showers as well as bed heights that make transfers simple and safe.All the hotel amenities are accessible. There is complementary coffee and tea in the morning as well as free beer, wine and margaritas from 5-6 in the evenings. There's a full service snack/coffee shop that also makes light meals. Geraldines is a casual but upscale restaurant with really interesting and adventurous dishes. Their bartender is amixologist master.If I had one bit of advice to management, I'd ask you to consider brighter lighting in the guest room hallways. Thats about it.Thanks for a great stay."
5,Excellent hotel,"I love the Kimpton chain so have stayed in many properties, but this might be the best. The upgrade to a spa suite didn't hurt. Amenities, including robes and evening wine hour, always add to the enjoyment. I also liked the downtown location, which was walkable to the State Capital, Congress Bridge, the SOCO area and, of course, Franklin's BBQ. All recommended."
3,New York West,"This is a nice hotel in the middle of a growing, vibrant, very active social city. If you are looking to drink/party with a group of entitled 20-30yo’s from CA/NY, this is your place! Well located for the party spots as we came to be aware. Nice, attractive and spacious lobby, clean but boring rooms. Geraldine’s looks nice but despite staying in the hotel for 4 days couldn’t get close to a table w/o a reservation (was filled with 20-30yo’s from NY/CA). Concierge was hit/miss; the young woman we spoke with was very helpful. I knew more about the city then the other kid (which is to say very little). Probably not the best choice for families, lots of options nearby. But if you’re coming to party probably one of the top choices."
4,Excellent & fun,"I was in Austin for one night on business and I wish I could have stayed longer in this very fun hotel. I was somehow upgraded to a suite (thank you whomever did this!) and it was fantastic! You enter into a good sized sitting room overlooking the pool then through a very big bathroom you reach a large bedroom. My room service breakfast was right on time delicious. If I come back to Austin again, I will definitely stay here."
5,Weekend visit,My recent stay was great - beds and linens were comfortable and clean with different types of pillow options. There is plenty of storage including drawers and closet space so the room doesn’t get cluttered during your stay. Geraldine’s was beautiful setting and delicious food and we loved the free happy hour cocktails. The staff was available and helpful at every interaction. Walking distance to so many wonderful bars and restaurants.
2,Overpriced for what you get!,"A nice clean place to stay with modern amenities. I would not however call it a four star hotel. Room service failed to visit, the housekeeping never came to clean the room and we had to call twice to get more towels. The in room breakfast we ordered the night before was late and was hard as a rock. The food was cold, hard and burned and the portions were small. NOT worth the $50 we paid for breakfast! When we added an extra night to our stay they tried to charge us more than they quoted previously. All and all it wasn't a bad stay, but for the price and the four star rating it has on the travel sites, there were a lot of missteps in the customer service. Bottom line, at the price point of this hotel, you are getting service below that of a Holiday Inn."
5,Romantic Getaway,"Relaxing and romantic. Spa tub and room serve are excellent. Restaurant and pool are excellent. And can rent bikes from them, too. Great location and very well-staffed, everything felt personal and genuine from them."
5,Very Fancy Hotel,The customer service is good. Decoration is fancy. We all love the vinyl record and table speaker in our room. The staff is very friendly. I believe their service is over valued than the price of this hotel.
5,Loved it!,"Unique place to stay and they made you feel right at home. Although valet is required, service was superior and the front desk was soooo helpful with daily check-ins via text messages. The restaurant was expensive, but quality of food was high"
1,BEWARE!!!!!! Avoid at all costs!,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. They give the Kimpton a horrible name.I was planning on checking in 4 nights while visiting Austin for a work conference. My plane was very delayed so I called at 8pm to let the front desk know I would be checking in around 2am. They told me that wouldn’t be a problem.Fast forward to 2am, when I go to valet my car. The valet was nowhere in sight. I went inside to ask about the valet and check in. Upon doing so, I was informed that my room was not available. The employee made up some BS reason that there were “maintenance issues”. They rebooked us at another hotel without informing us. In the 7 hours between when i called to let them know we’d be checking in late and actual attempt to check in, we did not receive ANY notification that our room was no longer available. No email, no phone, no text, nothing.I let the manager, Nick, know that we would be cancelling the rest of our reservation (3 more nights) and would require a full refund. He stared at me with a blank expression throughout this entire exchange. He did not even apologize for this EPIC mistake. I travel all over the world throughout the year and have never, EVER not had a room to check into after making a reservation.Aside from this giant error on the part of Kimpton Van Zandt, this hotel is in a very undesirable part of Austin. I even saw a prostitute standing on the corner. I would not feel safe walking anywhere outside of this hotel, so if you stay, expect to spend money for car services.Shame on you, Kimpton Van Zandt.Learn how to manage your bookings and while you’re at it, teach your “managers” how to handle disgruntled customers."
5,Enjoying Our Stay,"We’re still at the HVZ and have read the reviews, some negative. We have found the hotel and staff to be excellent. We have a King Corner and the room is a nice size and very bright. Very comfortable bed and housekeeping has been timely and thorough. The room could use some drawers in addition to the Armoir. I’m also very impressed with the Fitness Room, including the cool towels. Happy hour a nice touch. Geraldine’s is a nice venue for dining, but also like the nightly music.I can see rooms on Rainey St experiencing noise. The street is wild!Overall, we’re enjoying our 4 day stay."
5,Our New Favorite Austin Hotel,"As a top tier member of IHG and Hilton chains, this was my first experience with Kimpton brand, which recently associated with IHG. A good thing which IHG really needed to pep up its top level hotels, including its just very slightly tired Intercontinental.Our Kimpton Van Zandt experience was first class every step of the way.As locals to the Austin area, we occasionally take a weekend getaway night in different downtown hotels. This was a spur of themoment reservation near the end of SXSW event with we rooms at best downtown hotels averaging $500/night. I was pleasantly surprised they accepted my IHG free night certificate, and included a complimentary upgrade to 14th floor riverview.I emailed the hotel the day before that it was a birthday celebration and didn’t hear back, but it was short notice. We were surprised and very pleased with the nice birthday card and complimentary extras waiting in our room.While it’s nice this hotel is pet friendly, it’s a real big plus one can choose a pet free room. Which I did.While some reviews complain about they feel are unfair high hotel and parking prices and blame the hotel, it’s a fact of life and par for the course in downtown Austin. There are less expensive alternatives further away.Location is great, an easy stroll to Rainey Street restaurants and bars and the river for a run or long walk. It actually feels much safer in that area surrounded with upscale high rise condominiums than in the hotels closer to the seedier 6th Street area.An overall outstanding stay and will be back."
1,Never ever stay there,"Back in October, I asked my Company global marketing team to book a feb stay at this hotel. We planned a four day HQ visit centered on this hotel stay. Approximately one week before our stay we were told that our reservations were being cancelled. Because another party needed our rooms. Clearly the newcomers must have been prepared to pay more. To add insult to injury the communications about this change were very haphazard. Some people received phone calls. Others an email. Some who called the hotel to clarify were told initially that their reservation was still good, further adding to the confusion. Then we were offered a free night at the hotel some other time as a concession. Ha! Why would we expect you to honor your commitments on a free room when you couldn’t even honor one that was paid?? Skin flint losers."
1,Poor Service Creates Failed Special Wedding Night Experience,"We chose to stay at the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt for our wedding night. Having lived in Austin for 5 years before moving to Houston, we thought this was a great choice. However, the hotel failed expectations for every request that was made.My father dropped off the luggage we needed for our honeymoon flight departing the next day. It was not delivered to our room, and we had to call down at 1AM to arrange for our luggage to be brought so we could actually have a change of clothes.My mother in law had called and paid for some food and champagne to be delivered to our room. This was not completed, and upon arrival after dropping us off it took over half an hour to get even a response from the night manager and amenities staff who failed on this behalf. Then, when they said it was resolved and on the way, it took more than 20 more minutes to have it delivered. After a long day, we were tired and ready to have a great night together, and this just left us sitting around in a tux and wedding dress waiting for food to be delivered along with our luggage. We were unable to change, or even take a shower due to a lack of clothes and robes that would only fit the most petite of individuals available.Finally, when we attempted to order room service for the next morning, we requested on the form it be delivered between 9:45AM and 10:00AM. We had to leave by 10:45 to get to the airport in time to check in to depart on our long travel for our honeymoon to the Maldives. At 10:15, our breakfast had still not arrived so I called down and was told it was being plated and on its way. At 10:30, it still had not arrived and we decided to leave so we could hopefully have time to grab something at the airport - considering we were not going to be eating this breakfast.In every single attempt to make our night special, the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt failed to perform. And in even the requests that should be expected to be fulfilled - such as basic room service, it was incomplete.Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. From the time we arrived at 11:30, we were unable to even go to bed until 2:00AM because we were dealing with the hotel staff. Even then, we didn't even get breakfast the next morning.For over $250 per night, go to the competition: go to the JW Marriott, go anywhere else, but this hotel is way overpriced for what you will be getting."
2,Hidden Parking Fee is Crazy,"I was not informed by the staff that I had a credit toward the wet-bar until checking out. Also, I knew that there would be a fee for parking, but had not seen the amount listed on their site, nor was I informed of it prior to checking out: $45.47 per night is crazy; we're in Austin, not Manhattan! Room was very nice and the hotel is very warm and charming. The hallways were very dimly lite and dark, making it difficult to read the room numbers as I was winding my way around searching for my room. The final bill was not tabulated correctly due to my exemption from state and local taxes for business related travel. I won't stay here again."
1,Housekeeping is terrible,"This hotel has a good location, but the housekeeping is the worst I've ever experienced. The soap was not replaced. The pillows were lumpy and hard! My bathrobe was taken away for some reason and not replaced. Trying to call housekeeping or front desk just rings and rings with no answer. Have now been waiting for over 20 minutes. Truly not up to Kimpton standards. Very sad."
5,"Nice city vibe, but small town feel","First impression is great. Staff to help us with bags, front desk is friendly and gave us water/beer at check in, room is clean and city like.Was given a beautiful and quiet room at end of hall with great view.Highly recommend this hotel and location"
4,Austin Van Zandt,"Great location and excellent bar scene. Room was very quiet and comfortable. Staff at front door were great, friendly and happy. Hotel was a bit outdated, compared to other Kimptons staff was friendly but reserved"
5,Great hoyel,"We stayed here for 4 nights as part of our USA trip and were really impressed. Rooms decent size and high spec - pool area really nice with good lunch food options. Lovely touch with happy hour drinks (wine, beer, margaritas for free!) every evening. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
5,Work trip stay - great hotel!,"I stayed here for a work meeting held at the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt. The hotel was amazing! Not only the decor, but the ambiance, hospitality of the staff was great! Not only do they provide you with a complimentary bottle of water or beer upon check-in (after noon), but they have a complimentary happy hour every night from 5-6pm in the lobby. The rooms are very nice. My only complaint would be the hallways are dark, so it is hard to see the hotel room numbers. But the restaurant and pool deck area are very nice. I would stay again if I visit Austin! The rooms we were in for business meetings were great and spacious. I would recommend this hotel."
5,Great place in Austin,"I loved (almost) everything about this hotel. The staff was friendly, the decor was nice, happy hour margaritas and wine were tasty, the music on the amazing phonograph was so much fun, bikes to borrow, yoga mats in the room, good food in Geraldine's, beautiful pool. My biggest complaint is the noise. My room faced Rainey Street and the music and talking/yelling from the various bars went on until 2am Thursday, Friday and Saturday (I noticed it other nights too, but nothing like on the weekend). It was not South By or anything else, just gets rowdy on the weekend. If you are one who is out partying til the wee hours, you won't notice or care, or if you are a heavy sleeper you'll probably be fine. If you are a light sleeper early to bed, then request a room on the other side of the hotel and I think that will be ok. Beds were super comfy, nice water pressure in the shower, great location..."
5,Terrific spot,Location was excellent. Wish I had been able to spend more time there. The staff is charming and the biscuits are delicious! The room was spacious and comfortable. Valet service was the fastest I've ever experienced.
5,Exceptional experience,"This hotel was exceptional from valet service thru checkout and everything in between. Staff was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and genuinely kind. Checkin included a beer or water (delightful after a drive) and the concierge helped make a special weekend phenomenal. We will be back and encourage you to try it too. You won’t be disappointed!"
4,Here for my company’s annual conference,"Never stayed here before but many times in Austin. This hotel compares quite well to those I’ve used before. Quite luxurious, good facilities, nice room, comfortable bed, very clean and new, helpful staff.Nice bathroom with walk-in shower; always a plus when it’s not over the bath, which I hate.The food provided at lunchtimes for our (100 person+) event was average at best; very bland and tasteless, but I can’t say for the food that’s usually served in the restaurant.Wi-fi was everywhere and fast.Overall, I can recommend this hotel."
4,Enjoyable but not memorable,"We stayed at Kimpton Hotel van Zandt for 3 nights a few days after New Year. We booked 2 Lakeview Spa King with a view overlooking the Lady Bird Lake. We didn’t think the view as that great (i’d say choose for a bigger, cheaper room with a living room, without the view). The room, restaurants and lobby are nicely decorated.Very good:1. The valet parking staffs are the best. They were always helpful and anticipated all our need every time we needed our car.2. Free happy hour at the lobby. It's nice to go back to the hotel after a long day outside to be welcomed with a glass of wine and relaxing atmosphere (with the exception of the 2 of three nights we were there: one evening they had a renovation crew working making loud banging noise on the second floor and on the other evening there was a big conference group staying in hotel and they were taking over the whole lobby area…so much for relaxation!)3. Cafe 605 near the lobby area has great coffee and variety selection of tasty pastries.4. The texting system. They texted you after your arrival and you just text them for whatever you need. Don’t forget to text them for the turndown service because you need to request for the turndown service if you want it.Not so good:1. Free coffee (served every morning at the lobby area) is tasteless.2. Dining options after 10 PM. The cafe closes at 10 pm and the last order at the restaurant is at 10 pm. So our only option was the room service, and even the room service menu was very limited after 10 pm, and it served most of the same foods as the lunch menu at the restaurant or cafe. No local beer and no homemade chili (for a $12++ cuban sandwich all I got was a Tabasco sauce!).3. The towels are very thin.4. On the day of our departure, the housekeeping knocked on our door at 9.50 am when we were busy packing.5. The bottle of water in the room will cost you $8 and the price is on a small on the small sticker on the cap. You blink and you won’t see it.Could be better...I called the reservation a week before our stay to make sure that my special requests were being taken care of. The lady from the reservation who attended my call assured me that they were being taken care of. From hearing her tone, I knew it wasn’t the case. On the arrival day: They left me a voicemail (because I was in the flight) to ask about the room assignment. Also I requested specifically for a crib for my baby. They gave us a Pack ’n Play with loose adult bed sheets instead. Not only my baby refused to sleep in it cause it was so hard, but also it is very dangerous to put a baby to sleep with a non fitted bed sheet.In conclusion, our stay was enjoyable but not memorable."
3,Nice and clean but overpriced,"I stayed here for 2 nights and found it to be comfortable but way overpriced. The free happy hour was a plus and the location was in walking distance to a lot of things, but the property sits in a weird dead end alley sort of place which isn't very attractive."
5,We will be coming back!,"What a great hotel. Centrally located and very nice. Great staff and clean room, loved the bath tub and shower! We were given a beer at check in and they also had a free social hour. We brought our dog along and did not have to pay an extra deposit. Staff was helpful and the valets were super friendly and helpful. We can't afford to stay here every time we are in Austin but we will be staying again for a treat!"
5,How many ways can you say superb?,"Outstanding- Fantastic- I love this hotel- I love the vibe I love it all except for the lack of hotel art (full disclosure: I own a company that specializes in improving room art with our high-resolution metal images) but this review isn’t about me it’s about this phenomenal Kimpton- the furnishings were modern -cool - the room was sizable- the robe OMG I forgot to ask about buying it (don’t steal - bad karma) - the bedding was soft - the bed was firm but not back breaking.The best thing about this chic hotel is the staff! Why I ever stayed at another hotel in Austin I could kick myself for - Kimpton rocks - I only wish they had a location in San Antonio where I am now.It is not inexpensive but I feel like it was worth every penny and just got my next booking ... I tend to travel a lot.Did I mention that they give you a choice between beer or water we upon check in? Nice touch!Room service was reasonable and perfectly on time and great quality.Happy!Very.I wanna go back ... now!ThanksRoom 1224 might not have art - then again, it doesn’t have bad art so that’s a plus - but it has great views!"
4,Very nice Hotel,Very nice hotel in a great location. Conveniently located next to Rainey Street with all the bars and food trucks. Upper class pet friendly hotel that will not disappoint. It has a great coffee shop in the lobby that serves pastries as well.
5,"Short, Good Times.","It's hard to write a comprehensive, three-sixty degree review of a place that you've only stayed in for two evenings, but what I did experience at the Van Zandt was nothing short of awesome. Dark moody rooms with views of some river; a ginourmous lobby decorated to the hilt in high rock 'n roll style; and a fantastic bar and restaurant all served to coalesce into a great (though short) stay at what I'm told is one of Austin's most 'charactery' hotels.It's located near a whole lotta ballyhoo -- lots of bars and restaurants nearby -- and the staff brings that helpful, big Texas friendliness big time.I definitely will return next time I find myself turning up for SXSW or some other business related thingamabob."
5,Beautiful upscale hotel with free happy hour,"One of the more hip and upscale hotels I've had the pleasure to stay with. The whole place is very well designed and I loved the personal touch of the fireplace and cosy seatings. The room was spacious, super comfortable bed and very clean. The shower was great and the room was simply gorgeous. The only thing I would highlight as something I didn't like as much was the gym. Good equipment but feels very crowded and perhaps a bit claustrophobic as there are no windows there but really overall it's a great hotel."
5,Nice boutique hotel,"Great welcome, with a glass of wine prior to check in:) great food, great staff, great bar on the 4th floor. Could be nice for business or pleasure. Downtown so perfect to visit. I recommend. Also nice rooms"
3,"Upscale hotel, great location, noisy","We have been to the Van Zandt a few times before, but only for brunch. The brunch has always been great and was again when we decided to actually stay here. However, the walls are unbelievably thin. We first noticed this when we could clearly hear the conversation next door. I mean detailed like ""what is the wifi code"". That minor compared to Saturday night - late Saturday night/early Sunday. The location is great since it is near new, cool bars and restaurants on Rainey street. But, with the thin walls being near the bars was not cool - especially around 2:00 am when the bars were still going strong. Not much sleep that night!"
5,Fantastic stay in Austin,"Recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at this hotel. The staff was very accommodating (found us an available room for a ridiculously early check-in and then granted us an almost equally ridiculous request for a late check-out) throughout our stay. The room was very nice. Especially enjoyed the great location to all of Austin’s fun stuff and, of course, the free Happy Hour in the hotel lobby each night. Would definitely stay there again!"
3,"Awesome location, but extremely loud, paper thin walls!","The hotel itself is gorgeous, and what you would expect for a Kimpton Hotel. Very modern and great aesthetically. The location is also very central and you can walk anywhere. The majority of the hotel staff was also very accommodating and kind.However, the walls are super thin and you can hear the people next door literally sneezing plus their entire conversations. Another thing to consider is that since the hotel is extremely close to Rainey street, it is VERY LOUD, but the noise does stop around 2 am, and starts back up again at 11 a.m.Our first night we got placed in a room right above the Geraldine's restaurant and it was very loud, we could hear chairs and furniture being moved around pretty much all day long. The great thing is that the staff was awesome and accommodating after I requested another room. The staff did accommodate us to a room on the 14 floor which was a bit more quiet, but there is really not much they could do considering Rainey street is wild all night long. I do appreciate the staff being understanding, that was a plus!One last thing that I will say which really upset my husband and I was that we tried to eat at Geraldine's one morning for brunch and the hostess told us the following verbatim: ""we only take reservations"", and when I proceeded to tell her that we are staying at the hotel she gave us the worst attitude and told us one more time :""we strictly only seat people with reservations"". Two minutes later, this couple who didn't have reservations (I know this-because they mentioned loudly they didn't) was seated in the main dinning area, so yeah not cool! I don't want to sound rude but when your paying over $350 a night to stay at this hotel, priority MUST be given to guests, period! I have stayed in 4+ star hotels all over the world and never have I been told I can't eat at the hotel restaurant unless I make reservations. Eventually she conceded and told us ""you can just sit at the bar"", which was very tight and not much space was available. I expected much more from the staff at Geraldine's. One plus though is that the DRINKS WERE AWESOME! the bartenders were amazing, and explained everything in great detail, which made up for that hostess being so rude.My husband and I have no children, and we are only 32, but this hotel was still very loud for us, reconsider if you are traveling with children or are looking to get some great zzzzz's."
5,Great hotel for a Christmas getaway,"From arrival, we were greeted with a lot of hospitality. We were offered a welcome beer or water. I selected the beer which was a local beer which made it even better. Even our two large pets were welcomed with open arms and they were also treated amazingly. We stayed on the 7th floor but the elevators were almost never busy. We took Uber or walked to locations in the Downtown area without an issue.I would definitely come back and would stay at other Kimpton properties because of my stay."
5,Impeccable,"We stayed here for three nights visiting our daughter, and thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful boutique hotel. Great location overlooking Lady Bird Lake, and walking distance to downtown attractions and restaurants. Bicycles are available. The staff was unfailingly courteous and helpful. Pricey internet and valet parking, but overall a great experience."
5,I Will say just One word about this hotel:WOW!!,"I would say : Austin is not a City, It is a state of Mind! I was so pleased that I picked a hotel that matched with this incredible City!! The hotel was so cool!! The lobby itself was The most unique I have seen! Plenty of space in The room, bathtub with City view!Close To a lot of restaurants!Everything was super!!"
2,Disappointed stay,"The bed was very uncomfortable which was not what I expected from a boutique, 4-star hotel. I’ve had a better night’s sleep at a 3-star hotel. Also, the walls are thin. You can hear people next door and down the hall. I should have stayed with my initial choice (Westin)."
5,"Beautiful property, great service, good location","Stayed here for 3 nights while checking out Austin. Great that it is near Rainey Street and the trails. Went for dinner at nearby restaurants every day, great diversity of food even for vegetarian. We gotten complimentary upgrade to Junior suite upon check-in without asking (best part about being IHG Platinum member ). Our request for high floor was honored. We got a nice view of the massive development going on in Austin. Upon entering the room, we were delighted to see chips, salsa plus a bottle of margherita, all beautifully presented to welcome us. What a great surprise!We opted for credit of $5 for every day of green-stay (no housekeeping) that we used for the cafe in lobby (quite overpriced-$4 for a toasted English muffin?), and $10 credit for minibar just being IHG member. How nice!The bathroom is gorgeous, double sinks with a large bathtub and separated toilet and shower room. Bathroom amenities (even bath salt) are provided in regular sized container. Bed is comfortable, pillows are just right, the room is perfect, although we like the TV (two in the junior suite) to be larger in this spacious room.Hallway area to elevator is a little dark, but totally understand that's the vibe. The room is comfortable, but we can hear the elevator even when we are not next to it ( our room is two rooms away, around a corner). The one-hour evening happy-hour in lobby offers decent selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks, in a night are by the fireplace.Service in general is friendly and professional. I enjoyed the request by text- there is no phone in the room. We were communicating with service team via text message (with my own cellphone), they were all vey courteous and prompt in reply. Amazing!"
5,Fun place to stay,"Great hotel, centrally located in Austin which is definitely in the middle of the party scene. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with great shower. Lobby is lively offering free margaritas at 5 every day for happy hour. We really enjoyed Geraldine’s, the hotel’s restaurant with outdoor seating by the pool.This is a party hotel, not really for kids."
5,My kind of heaven,"Beer upon arrival, perfect location, people, pool, lobby drinks and seating options. I'd call it life done right! And in a perfect location for bars and what not with people over 30 too!! It even smells good. I think I'm in love."
1,Noisy on the 9th Floor until 2am,"They don’t tell you there’s live music next door until 2am Friday and Saturday night. You can hear it at least to the 9th floor. For these prices, they should warn you. Forget sleeping!Walls are thin. You hear your neighbors. They give you a white noise machine to block out the sound if you ask. That’s like a restaurant giving you Tums before a meal.This place has NY prices with none of the soundproofing. Stay away!"
5,"Location, location, location","Located right next to Rainey Street, the Lake walking/biking trail and on the south end of downtown. With a conference at the Convention Center, and a government rate available, the location couldn't have been better. That said, this is a partying area, so got a bit hectic in the evenings. The daily parking fee was high, but not unreasonable. The cafe was just right for a quick bite, especially considering the number of amazing restaurants within walking distance. The decor was beautiful, and I loved having 2 outlets and a USB port in the bedside table. Enjoy!"
4,Unique boutique hotel with an excellent location and staff!,"This is a fabulous hotel nicely appointed and decorated. The rooms are a great size, clean and nicely laid out and the beds very comfortable. There was free coffee in the lobby in the morning which was appreciated because the rooms have no coffee service at all (i.e. no Kureg or coffee maker).Front desk staff were very nice, we were offed a beer or water while we checked in which was a nice touch. Another nice touch was a voucher if you waived room servicing. I believe it was $5/day which we applied to our breakfasts.A CON to the room was that it had an adjoining room so we could hear everything going on in the next room (even someone sneezing!) through the door.The location is a block off Rainey which is a happening street with lots of cool bars and well within walking distance of 6th which is another hip area with restaurants and bars. We walked everywhere.We had a car so had to valet park ($42 daily), but there nothing cheaper in the are so we bit the bullet. The service included in/out which at least gave us some flexibility.CLARENCE at the door was super helpful, friendly and fun yet professional and gave us great recommendations. He deserves to be recognized and rewarded. He really went above and beyond!"
4,Beautiful downtown hotel,"Stayed 3 nights while attending a conference in town. The Van Zandt felt almost like home, from the inviting sitting area (with fireplace!), to the clean and super comfortable room, to the complementary coffee station in the morning. Almost forget the welcome beer to take up to your room upon check-in! The food and cocktails at Geraldine's were exceptional, as were the musical acts--it was the perfect way to unwind after a long travel day. Highly recommend both the hotel and Geraldine's! I only wish it were warm enough to visit the beautiful pool during my stay (early February)."
4,"Good area, fun hotel!","Fun Austin hotel in a great area, can find evening fun steps away or just go to Geraldine’s! Good for the older yet still hip crowd! May be slightly overpriced, but hey... that’s Austin for you. If you need to get an early nights sleep, make sure to stay above floor 5, as Geraldine’s is on the 4th, BUT music stops at midnight, so not too bad. Will definitely stay here again."
5,Great Experience,"I loved this hotel. The people that work in the lobby and cafe are so friendly, helpful, and down to earth. They were phenomenal! If I come back to Austin, TX I will be staying here again if possible. If you do go upstairs to the restaurant, be prepared to try something different. It is more Tapas than a traditional meal. The restaurant is also a little pricey, but close to on par for the area it is in."
5,Rock Star Status at the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt,"You will feel no less than Rock Star status during your stay at the Van Zandt. The eclectic music inspired decor, friendly hotel staff, and abundant amenities are more than stellar. Evening happy hour encourages hospitality among guests in a lobby that is inviting and comfortable. You will not be disappointed in your experience if you choose to stay here."
5,Austin on my mind,"Hotel is lovely. Location is nice, close to the downtown. Restaurant full of different flavors, both during breakfast and dinner. Great swimming pool and view from the terrace. Clean room. Problem with high humidity in the bathroom, too poor ventilation."
4,Nice but loud,Hotel location is nice to Rainey st. Noise both inside and out was challenging. If you are up later and enjoying the party no problem. But anything else you might want to find a spot away from the action.Clean and orderly and staff tried hard to keep us happy.We did not bring the noise issue to their attention as there would be little they could do.
5,Hip and Homey,So often we hate staying hotels because no matter how much you spend they never manage to feel as comfortable as home and you can’t sleep. Not the case here.Our room was quiet and had at least as many amenities as home.Downstairs the cafe was spacious and easy to navigate. Right out the door - fun bars of Rainey street on one side and the gorgeous Ladybird Lake trail and park system on the other.
5,Great hotel right in the heart of all the action,This hotel is very modern and well situated right next to Rainey Street. I would definitely stay here again. The rooms are ample in size and the service is excellent. The gym and outdoor pool area are fantastic.
4,Recent Austin Stay,Very nice and trendy hotel for Austin. Prices are a little high but the area of town the hotel is in is expensive. The surrounding area of the hotel is party central for Austin but I was impressed how clean it remained. Didn't see much security but I am sure they were around.
5,A happening place to stay!!,"Had a wonderful time, hotel and staff were wonderful and courteous. We were greeted with a smile everywhere we went, be it the lobby, valet or the restaurants. Seemed like hotel employees really enjoy working there. Geraldine's has fabulous food!"
5,Enjoyed the stay,We stayed for one night after staying at another hotel. I love Kimpton properties and happy to use my Karma free night here. We had a bit of a wait to check in but the room was ready and we got upgraded to a lakeview. I loved the decor and ambiance throughout the hotel except dark hallways. The room was very nice and spacious. The view of the lake and pool below was a nice touch. We didn't eat at Geraldine's as we wanted to try restaurants on Rainey Street and Iron Works for BBQ. The Cafe 605 in the hotel was good for a quick breakfast and coffee/tea. Also I love the raid the bar to get midday or a late night snack. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!
5,Austin at its best,What a great place to stay when visiting Austin. Located right next to Rainey Street and just a quick drive in from the airport. The staff is phenomenal and care about all the little details. Food was superb too!
5,Have your birthday there!,"The VZ went above and beyond for my birthday, they make you feel very special! So happy with them and their service. Can't say thank you enough! Thank you to the Hotel Van Zandt staff for all your hard work in making my trip special!"
3,No coffee in room and charged $90 for MANDATORY Valet Parking!,"The people were extremely nice, especially the valet drivers. Our room was nice, and the bed very comfortable. I've never been charged for internet before and didn't expect to be at a ""fine"" hotel. I need coffee when I wake up! I don't want to get dressed and go down 12 flights. What was worse, we had to leave at 5 am for the airport with NO coffee because it wasn't available anywhere then. That's just unacceptable to me. And then I opened my email to see a bill for $90 for ""parking the car overnight"". When we arrived, we were told the valet parking is mandatory. That means we had no choice! We were NEVER told that we would be charged $45.00 a night for parking. I'm so angry about this I could explode. We will not stay at the Hotel Van Zandt again. The beds at La…"
5,Fantastic !!!,We stayed 2 nights in this amazing hotel. Adam on the front desk was so helpful when we needed advice on where to go in the evening. The breakfasts were so enjoyable and the staff in the restaurant 1st class. Happy hour drinks was a real positive and the live music brilliant .. thank you for making our stay so wonderful.
5,Can I give 10 stars?,"From arrival to departure, bar and restaurant time, speaking with the bellmen — every touch point was top-notch. Zeriah checked me in and, upon seeing that it was my birthday, upgraded me to one of the most beautiful suites I've seen. After weeks of long work and time on the road, it was such a treat. She checked in with me multiple times to ensure I was having a good trip and offer to provide further services, and she and Sophia were both very accommodating. The staff at Geraldine's were awesome, the bellmen were always super courteous and helpful — everyone was great. Wouldn't change a single thing. [Except maybe that I had to work and miss wine hour.]Zeriah, thank you for making the end of my long journey as good as it possibly could have been — you knocked it out of the park!"
1,A very hip cool nice hotel,This staff is so friendly and so wanting to please. I enjoyed my view from suite Grace. I highly recommend it. The bathroom is amazing!! the Coffee is really great too. I only drink soy and luckily they had it. The food in all restaurants is well done.
5,Reviewing first impressions only. Complete review to follow.,"Just checked in for a one night stay. Chek-in is posted to be 4pm but we had no problems and no questions asked about checking in at 2. Check in took approximately 2 minutes. Choice of free bottle water or can of beer at check in was a nice surprise. Free happy hour from 5-6pm (might be weeknights only) including beer, wine and margaritas. Sorta makes up for the ridiculous $42/day parking fee. Friendly staff all around. Cleam rooms amd beautiful lobby. So far so good!"
5,Fantastic Experience,"Wonderful Austin experience! Close to many fun restaurants. Even has good entertainment at the hotel. Convenient for coffee and breakfast without having to leave hotel in the rain. The lobby and happy hour with beer, wine and margaritas was a plus."
5,Great new hotel,"Good looking and very comfortable hotel. Excellent bed and pillows. Very clean and good amount of space. Close to the Convention Center and night spots, but quiet in room. Close drive to South Congress and downtown areas."
5,"Location, Location, Location!","Location is superb as well as everything else about this hotel! Felt like a boutique hotel.The decor is very chic! The meal experience at Geraldine's was fabulous! The pool was very inviting, but it wasn't quite warm enough on this particular visit! Loved our visit!"
4,Really cool!!,"Love the location and this hotel! Rooms are spacious and functional (wish there was a bathtub) we had a deluxe queen -beds are very comfortable!All the staff was very friendly , efficient and helpful , with the exception of the bartenders in Geraldine, I am going to mention that to management. However the pool area and restaurant were beautiful!!If you are here on Sunday walk down Rainey street such fun great brunches all around !!"
5,Five stars are not enough!,"I planned a trip to Austin to celebrate my husband's birthday. Our stay at Hotel Van Zandt made the trip truly perfect! Our room was comfortable and well-appointed, with birthday treats to surprise him upon our arrival. We were on the 11th floor, facing Rainey Street, but aside from a faint musical beat, this was a quiet location. The staff could not have been more amiable, helpful, and accommodating. We loved social hour, with wine and different little bites each evening.The hotel's location is terrific. Numerous restaurants and bars are only a few minutes' walk away, and access to the river path is an easy walk, as well. We strolled downtown, too, which took perhaps 15 minutes.We capped off two evenings with drinks at the hotel's restaurant, Geraldine's. We also sampled a few of their small plates, which were delicious. We wish we'd had the chance to enjoy a full meal there.I cannot recommend Hotel Van Zandt enough! Thank you to everyone who made my husband's birthday so special and memorable."
5,Back again - it is now completed and is THE place to stay!,"I wrote a previous review of this hotel when it first opened to say how great it was despite the construction going on - which gave it 4 out of 5. I'm so please to be able to give it 5/5 after my recent stays here!The staff are wonderful, incredibly helpful and down to earth. The rooms were great and the food and drink in Geraldines was excellent. We really enjoyed wine hour as well!I love the decor and design which is clean, modern and unpretentious. It's good value and in a great location both for the highway and for downtown. There is also a lot of storage space!Will always stay here whenever I am in Austin - wouldn't even consider another hotel."
4,Trendy Experience,"Stayed for business. Had a Spa Suite so the room was spacious and nice. The halls and the hotel are average but the rooms have nice finishes. The location and view were nice for the short period of time I was there. Staff couldn't be nicer, received regular text messages to make sure my stay was going well. I normally would stay in a better known luxury hotel but wanted to try something a little different. This was definitely a more casual trendy feel. Not bad, just different then what I am accustom to."
3,Just a room,"Our first stay. Was nicely decorated. Bathrobes were trendy but not soft or comfy. The hostel is in a trendy location for the younger set, or those who like night life so the rates are fairly high for average rooms. We got the room greatly discounted, and would not have felt there to be any exceptional value to justify the $400 night regular charge.We’ve stayed at a lot of fine, high end hotels, but our guest room here was just average.Did not have a chance to see the rest of the facility as we were in and out. Must valet park car.Giant sized bottles of shampoo, body wash and conditioner are shared by all the guests before you, and that isn’t my cup of tea. I’d have no idea if someone tampered with them or not."
5,Second Visit - Great!,"After a wedding weekend in San Antonio we booked a night here to decompress before flying home. This was our second stay, and just as great as the first time. Staff is great, pool deck and bar area are excellent. The restaurant is quite good as well. It’s right on Rainey Street for access to nightlife, and not far from South Congress. My wife and I have stayed at several Kimpton properties, and this one is by far our favorite!"
5,Great Service especially for pet owners!,Staff definitely goes above and beyond.We stayed at the Hotel Van Zandt for a mini vacation to Austin with our new 1 yr old dog. We left our dog in his kennel while we went out for dinner. I guess he got a little excited every time he could hear people walk past the room. We got a text from the hotel that our furry friend was making a little noise and could they take him for a walk. They entertained him at the front desk and in the back office until we got back from dinner. We were so impressed with how sweet and understanding they were with our immature pup.We have always enjoyed Kimpton hotels but we are definitely staying at the Van Zandt from here on out.
4,A fun week in downtown Austin,"Beautiful hotel. Extremely friendly & helpful staff! Hotel is several blocks from 6th street which because it was cold, made walking to clubs/events not possible. Overnight parking is an additional $45 which seemed a high considering rooms are almost $300/night. First night we had a very noisy room, I reported it & the staff immediately upgraded our stay to a suite which was much quieter."
2,Disappoint from expectations,"I was not happy with value versus the price. There were very few amenities. Asking for slippers took two phone calls and 1.5 hours to get. There was only warm water, no hot. No desk chair. Geared only to millennials for street scene."
5,Loved It!!,"Great location, comfy bed, quiet and clean room. Dogs were welcome, pool looked very nice ( it was too cold to swim). Nice coffee bar in the morning and a happy hour in the evening. It was very nice to have a drink at the hotel, then head to Rainey street, loaded with fun bars and food trucks, delicious! They even had bikes to borrow, from the front desk and there is a path in the back of the hotel that goes for miles. Overall, everyone was very welcoming and it was such a nice hotel!"
5,Fantastic food,"We stayed at the hotel for two night's comfortable big beds, nice interior (I liked the bathroom door) extremely friendly people and the food in Geraldine's was out of this world:) I also liked the idea with the 5$ cupon that you get if you don't get the daly cleaning, more hotels should do that. Free internet."
5,Anniversary at Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt,"Incredible, wonderful place. We had a room on the 11th floor with views of downtown Austin from two different ""view windowns"". Had never visited Rainey St and found the convenience of good restaurants within walking distance a bonus feature. Only thing I will do different next time is demand a room on the other side of hotel that does not face Rainey St.....too much base and too loud for folks that do not stay up past 11.....getting old sucks. This is a great hotel and we will revisit in the spring."
5,My favorite Kimpton property yet,"The vibe of the hotel is effortlessly cool with great local touches that really fit the feel of the city. It's located right near the convention center and it was very easy to get all around the city from the hotel.The room was spotless and bed was really comfortable as always. There was a bluetooth speaker in the room as well which was a nice touch.Great service throughout the stay. I received occasional texts throughout my stay from the hotel asking how the stay was going and if I needed anything. They would respond very quickly if I texted back with a request. The concierge suggested a great restaurant and made a reservation before I'd arrived.The restaurant at the hotel, Geraldines was delicious (although the portions were on the smaller side). The Goat Tartare, Gnocchi with Oxtail, and BBQ Shortrib were all fantastic. This restaurant was busy during my entire stay and clearly a spot that locals hung out at as well.My stay was in the winter, but the pool deck and outdoor bar adjacent to Geraldine's looked like it would be a cool, relaxed (not pretentious) scene in warmer weather."
5,Trendy Austin hotel,"We just got back from staying at the Van Zandt in Austin. It was absolutely wonderful. From check-in, to the Social Hour, to brunch/drinks at Geraldines, it was unique, trendy, and absolutely delightful. We had drinks both nights and listened to awesome bands, and the ""vinyl brunch"" at Geraldine's was fab. We had one minor blip with our shower and it was fixed immediately and the service recovery was awesome. We will definitely be back to the Van Zandt our next trip to Austin. Great location (near Rainey St) and great hotel!!"
3,Second night regrets,First room was not furnished adequately. Second room was next to the service elevator so it was loud moving up and down all hours of the day. Second night and into depart day there was no water in the room and the hotel did not notify us there was a problem.
5,KIMPTON JUST GETS IT RIGHT EVERY TIME,"We have several international businesses and travel extensively. We probably live in hotel rooms over 300 days a year. We stay in all levels of hotels from 1-5 stars and you do get what you pay for, but even some upper echelon places just miss the mark here and there. And then there are some that exceed expectations no matter what level. Kimpton has always been in that category for me. I have my expectations and then they seem to kick it up one notch.The Van Zandt was just a one-night stay-over in our first visit to Austin and it simply was not long enough. And once again, there were just so many little things that I just didn't expect put a grin on my face.Special shout outs to the staff cannot go unmentioned. All the staff at the reception desk were incredible and Zion (""No we weren't making a delivery for the wedding!"") and Sergio could not have been more helpful or professional.We'll surely be back and stay longer! Thanks for the great stay.P.S. Extra points for being pet friendly too!"
5,Perfect Stay,"In a vibrant part of town - but away from the noise of 6th street. It was a truly lovely hotel that embraces the theme of local music. Everything in terms of hospitality, comfort, service was nothing less than you'd expect at a Kimpton hotel. Its now a favorite and we definitely will go back when in Austin. We chose this hotel as a place to overnight when seeing a concert downtown at the Frank Erwin Center downtown. They really kicked off the stay nicely when they offered us a local beer on checkin. It was a quick uber to the concert, and close enough that we walked and pedicabed it back after stopping for some late night street food and drinks."
5,A very special place!,"The Hotel Van Zandt is all about the experience! If you're looking for a special place to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or really anything, you should book this hotel today. The corner king room is the way to go! You'll have views in two directions. It's spacious and impeccably decorated! Also, we didn't eat at Geraldine's but did go there for music and drinks after dinner and the atmosphere is amazing! The hotel is perfectly located for Town Lake activities or for hanging out on Rainey Street (cool bars and restaurants.) Check it out, you won't regret it!"
5,Weekend Staycation,"As Austin locals we are picky about where we choose for staycations. My husband and I were extremely happy we stayed here! The hotel decor was really cool, drinks and food were fabulous and the location couldn't be beat. We will be back for sure!"
4,A hotel that makes things right,"This is actually a follow up review. My family and I stayed at Hotel Van Zandt in November and had an issue with one of our rooms. Long story short, the inconvenience we experienced during our stay was made up for by Joe, HVZ's manager. It's a nice hotel in a great location with a great management team. We'd stay there again."
5,Great venue for company meeting,"Stayed at the Van Zandt for a three day company meeting for approximately 50 people. From check-in, to the individual rooms, to all the services they provided us during our meeting the hotel was outstanding. When we arrived there were a few people in line to check in. It wasn't a long wait at all but we were offered beers and margaritas - which we all took advantage of after our long flight in. It made a great first impression. The rooms were nicely decorated; the only negative was that the hallways were all really dark. I'm sure that was intentional but I just didn't love the look. Our meeting rooms were well set up and the catering/banquet team was always nearby if we needed something. We also enjoyed the nightly happy hours.Everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The other added benefit was the location right by Rainey Street - it was easy to go out for the evening and know you were always within walking distance of the hotel. I would definitely stay there again on a future trip."
5,20th Anniversary,My wife and I chose Hotel Van Zandt for our overnight 20th anniversary celebration stay. All the staff knew of the event and did everything possible to accommodate a memorable time. There was even chilled champagne waiting as we walked into the room! We will most certainly be back.
5,"Great Property, Very well Managed","Lovely experience. I travel a lot for work and it’s rare to find such a great hotel. It was centrally located near a fun area of town, had hip decor and, most importantly, gracious service. I highly recommend staying at the Van Zandt!"
5,Business Trip but near Rainey Street,"Great hotel, I just like the Kimpton's style, and it's a block from Rainey Street, which is lined with cool restaurants and bars. Excellent restaurants on the 4th floor with a pool deck. Very good experience, would stay there again."
5,Get Away,"Great place. Great Happy hour. Great Staff. The room was very mod, and comfortable. Great view of Austin and Lady Bird Lake. Had a late dinner that was a bit spendy. Also had brunch the next morning. Best steak and eggs."
5,STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The location is great, the rooms are terrific, Geraldines on the 4th floor has great music and reasonably priced drinks and the front staff (thanks ADAM, TRANG and AUTUMN) are some of the best and nicest of any hotel I've ever stayed in. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
1,Bad experience,Worst experience with a hotel I've ever had. Have a list of items that were way below par with the room and the service my boyfriend and I received. This was the second year my company had their holiday party in one of their banquet rooms and sadly I hope we don't have it there next year.
5,"Austin is FUN, this Hotel is phenomenal!","One of our favorite cities to visit & Hotel Van Zandt makes it all an overall fabulous experirence! Everything about the hotel is great including the location & access in & out of town! We enjoyed the amenities, attentive staff, and wonderful food, drink & live music too!!"
5,Exceptional Hotel in Austin!,"We decided to book a staycation in Austin. Having a new puppy, it was difficult to get away. Then, I discovered that Hotel Van Zandt is PET FRIENDLY! It worked out perfect! The rooms are very comfortable, the hotel staff is very friendly!"
4,Austin for Wedding,Travelled to Austin to attend wedding. Most of the out of town wedding guests stayed at Van Zandt. Very nice hotel with all the amenities. The bed was super comfy. Be prepared to pay $45 per night parking; no where to self park.
5,Van Zandt is Glorious,"We had been waiting for a Kimpton to come to Austin. Well they built a winner. This hotel is beautiful. We had a great time here. The Staff is super friendly and goes the extra mile. My wife forgot her iPad when we checked out, and the staff took care of mailing it to us!"
5,"Loved the quirky atmosphere, real nice place to stay","This was the overflow hotel for my business meeting and I'm glad it was and it had all the amenities as the meeting hotel but had a lot more atmosphere and fits well with the Austin vibe. I joined the loyalty program and you immediately get a $10 credit towards any of the cool items or food/drink you've got in your room, so a nice little perk."
5,Exceptional,"Kimpton's Hotel Van Zandt is a perfect example of why I and so many others love the ""Kimpton Brand""! Exceptional customer service from the front desk, restaurant and housekeeping staffs. Rainy first day here and staff bent over backwards to find extra umbrellas and forgotten toiletries.The hotel was clean, decorated with boutique Texan Restoration Hardware Furnishings. Awesome! Loved the holiday decor. Rooms clean, beds comfy, clean bathrooms.Hosted ""happy hour"" was a nice way to enjoy local craft beers, wine and homemade margaritas. I loved meeting Nik, Brian and Amanda one evening who were in charge of the evening festivities.Lastly, Rosia and her co worker (forgot name) really showed their pride keeping the first floor lobby and areas immaculate. Loved their smiles."
5,Best Hotel Stay Ever!!,"I had to be in Austin for an IBM event at the Sheraton. The Sheraton was totally sold out, as was many other hotels in the area. Searching the web, we found the Hotel Van Zandt, and boy am I glad we chose that hotel. At first, we chose it because it was close to the Sheraton. But I would choose it over and over again because of the way the hotel made us feel and took care of their customers. I loved my stay at this hotel, and will definitely seek out other Kimpton's wherever I may be traveling to...I was that impressed!!!From the décor to the amenities inside the room and within the lobby, they sure do know how to make you feel welcome and appreciated!!Highly recommend!!"
5,"Everything you would or could every want during a stay in Austin, Texas!","I'll start off by saying that I am a local, so I feel that I know Austin pretty well, take it from me when I say that the Hotel Van Zandt is everything wonderful about austin wrapped up in one perfect place. Everything from the music, to the lobby happy hour, and welcoming pets of every shape and size, Hotel Van Zandt really does it. The location could not be beat, you are steps away from Rainey Street or just an incredibly short walk away from the convention center and down town Austin. I staycationed here during the Thanksgiving weekend with my Mother and even she was incredibly surprised and thrilled with the service and stay. The staff is incredibly friendly, the beds are comfortable, the view from the pool is amazing, and the decor is definitely something to write home about. One of my favorite things about the hotel is their pet policy, I really think it's absolutely beyond great that they welcome pets of all shapes and sizes, I have two large dogs at home that are never able to travel with me because they are either two big or do not fit the ridiculous pet rules. During our stay we even say a couple staying with their pet pig. If that isn't Austin then I don't know what it. I can not say enough great things about Hotel Van Zandt and will for sure staycation there again!"
5,Built around music!,"Not only is the view from Geraldine's so beautiful, but you can hear music all the time! The chandeliers are even made of musical instruments! Also, I love Rainey Street!! I highly recommend the Van Zandt!"
2,Make sure your front desk team doesn't disrespect your guest.,"Gorgeous hotel but lacks communication to future hotel guest. I was not advised of Geraldine's which is the (only restaurant on the property) was going to be closed during the my stay. Super disappointing, honestly would of stayed somewhere else. My parents really wanted to have dinner there, if we were informed of this ahead of time we would of stayed elsewhere. To top it off the front desk lady that checked us in, was very disrespectful telling me things about my mother that were honestly very out of line. I couldn't believe what she said. Honestly, Location and the fact that it was just opened last year is basically the most attractive thing."
5,"Great hotel, very friendly employees","Stayed one night with our small puppy to attend a concert at the Erwin Center. They were extremely accommodating, especially to our dog. They do need a dedicated area for pets to relieve themselves, there was only a small grassy area across the street. Some issues with things not being credited at checkout (Kharma benefits), but it was easily fixed. Very tech savvy, I like being able to text for things instead of having to call. Lots of fun bars and food trucks in the area, but it can get very loud and crazy on Saturday nights.Nice big corner spa suite with good views."
1,Awful experience!,Restaurant not openLounge not openPool not openno coffee pot in roomRIDICULOUS to pay so much money for a hotel with NOTHING availableRoom not ready at GUARANTEED timeSoap smells awfulRoom was hot
5,Amazing quality,"Aside from a few hiccups such as the noisy hallways, which isn't always necessarily the hotels fault due to other guests, and the ridiculously expensive parking this place is as close to perfection as you can get. The customer service from top to bottom is amazing. The facilities and decor are unique and a good reflection of Austin. Food is worth every cent. I would recommend trying to book a room on the highest level as possible due to all the sounds coming from Rainey street but with that being said it's still a great location in Austin downtown."
5,Y'ALL WILL LOVE IT!,"If you are the stuffy type, do not stay here....this is a fun hotel that celebrates the culture of Austin with plenty of live music and a young crowd. The hotel is located near many bars and restaurants as well as the walk/biking/walking trail that runs along the lake (which I highly recommend) is a fantastic way to enjoy the city. You can also rent paddle boards, kayaks, etc nearby.The staff are A+ on service in every way....really going out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.Our room was fantastic with floor to ceiling windows that looked over the lake and city. I definitely recommend a room on a higher floor with a water view....it is worth the extra money. As always with Kimpton properties, the bed & linens were SO comfortable.One of the perks staying at a Kimpton property is the free happy hour each day from 5 to 6pm. It is a great way to mingle with other guests and relax before going out for the evening. The complimentary tea & coffee service (plus hot chocolate & fixings) is also really nice in the mornings.This is the first time I have stayed at this Kimpton and was very impressed....we can't wait to come back! Hopefully we will se y'all soon."
3,"Trendy but pricey, even for boutique hotel","We had corner ""soaking tub"" room, quite a luxurious view from the tub. Room was good size and comfortable. I was impressed they use text message to assure you are satisfied with everything. I'd tacked on an extra night due to a company-paid meeting, and was shocked at the rate, and I am a frequent traveler and hotel user. Business reception food not that great, and we had some dispute about how many drinks were served (we would not have been walking had we consumed what they billed us). At the bar, bartenders seemed uncoordinated and mixed up our orders and our checks - in fact we asked for our checks and they brought us another round, which was then wasted. Walls seemed thin between rooms, can get kind of noisy. I would have expected not to be charged for internet, that seemed petty after such a high rate. Further, the shower leaked onto the floor, and no way to stop that. So after each shower, we had to put towels on floor, which of course meant then we had to ask for additional towels for later. I'd look into another area hotel if I returned."
5,Great Hotel In Great Location,"I normally don't type reviews but wanted to go out of my way to say that I certainly recommend the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt. The hotel is clean, looks recently remodeled, has a great coffee bar/cafe in the lobby, a popular restaurant, and is located next to Rainey Street (which has lots of restaurants and nightlife). The room was well done and comfortable."
3,Noisy Hotel,I had the opportunity to stay at the HVZ for business and while the staff was friendly and rooms were comfortable there were some serious issues during our stay. One morning the hot water went down and nobody seem to know how long it was going to be out for or when it would be fixed so a number of guests went to the conference without showering. Perhaps the biggest issue is its noise level and the staff doesn’t seem to police its guests to be more courteous of others. The hotel is dog friendly which is great but there were times when dogs would bark all day or at night and they’re owner wasn’t there to quiet them down. The other issue were guests coming back after a heavy night of drinking at nearby Rainey Street and partying into the night past 2am and keeping others up late. The same issue for rooms like mine which faced the pool and even though I was up high on the 14th floor I could hear the noise level from the bar at the pool down below. The walls seem thin and don’t block out much noise. I’m not against partying but I think the hotel could benefit from having someone go floor to floor late at night and remind guests to be more courteous.
5,Great hotel in unique location,"I stayed here with my daughters for 2 nights during a convention. We were all very impressed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is just 2 blocks from the convention center entrance, and 1/2 block from Rainey Street - which is chock full of little restaurants, bars, food truck courts, etc. It seems to be part of a renewal of that small corner of downtown. The decor is urban country quirky - clean lines but with charm. Many of the poor reviews center around what they don't have - but the trick is to just ask. They'll provide a Keurig coffee pot on request. You can empty the minibar fridge to store your own food - just stack all the items for sale up near it so they know you didn't eat them. The beds were super comfortable. The dark woods are a nice contrast to the bright sunny windows, and there is a definite ""Keep Austin Weird"" vibe that fits well with the city. I enjoyed the old Austin map that covered one wall of our room. I'd definitely stay there again if I needed accommodations down town."
5,Great First Impression,"It is true that you never get a second chance to make a great first impression. Last night I visited your hotel for cocktails with one of your guests. It was very busy out front when I arrived but your valet staff, Will & Grant, handled everything with professionalism and poise. They set the tone for a very memorable first time visit to your hotel. Kudos to them.Clayton Reed"
5,Unique Boutique Experience in the Heart of Rainey Street,"We celebrated our wedding night/weekend here. The hotel is beautiful, with subtle hints to Austin's music scene all over the hotel. The staff is wonderful, the rooms are great, and the pool deck is something that you can enjoy almost year round (thank you Texas sun)! You are placed right in the heart of on of Austin's best night life scenes, Rainey street is the perfect place to grab a drink or make a great night out! You cannot go wrong staying here, it is truly an experience."
5,"Feels like super cool, if super cool was a feeling","Great location, walkable to everything downtown like the clubs, Congress bridge bats, the Longhorn stadium, and a grilled cheese food truck is visible from your room (darned good grilled cheese)! Geraldine's has some awesome food. The decor of the hotel is calm, hip, and moody blue. The robes are awesome while you raid the mini bar when a Kimpton member. Nice people at the valet park and doors. Pet friendly too! You are right next to Rainey street but you don't hear a lot of noise. The hotel doors are a little thin for me, you hear everyone in the hall, but otherwise where is the last place you had LARGE shampoo in a wood-look ceramic shower?"
5,I didn't want to leave.,My room was clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the food at Geraldine's and the atmosphere. The mini bar was well stocked with a variety of beverages and snacks. The bed was comfortable. My stay was perfect!
1,Save your money,"If you are drunk adult making noise at all hours then this is the place for you! Even better if you have a car with you, the overnight valet is $50. Walls are thin and you might as well leave you door open to the hallway- it’s that loud. All hours noise whether it’s thumping music from outside or from inside the hotel. Housekeeping nonexistent. Front desk staff cannot be bothered and basically pose the entire time. Distinct emphasis on fabulous and lack of personality or even follow through with requests. Best employees are the valet parking staff."
5,"Fabulous hotel, great location.","The hotel is beautiful and the staff is excellent. The location is perfect for dining, shopping and strolling. Would not stay anywhere else in Austin. Their pet policy really made us feel at home even though we did not bring our pets along this time."
5,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel with access to hike and bike trails and downtown attractions. Located in a transitional neighborhood that has dining interest. Unique perks at the hotel. Courteous staff. The hotel appears to be efficiently managed.
5,A unique hotel experience in the heart of Austin,"This was our first visit to Austin and we had a wonderful time at the Kimpton Van Zandt. We upgraded to the Kin Spa room which was spacious, beautifully decorated and well appointed. The hotel is in a great location, close to Rainey Street and within walking distant of all the downtown attractions. The staff was always prompt and attentive."
5,really special property,"Hotel has an excellent location, right near fun bars and food trucks, looking at the Austin skyline. Rooms were large and decorated super cool. The staff was really kind and even helped with printing out some emails for me last minute. We were greated with waters and local beers upon arrival, which was great after coming in from the airport. The greeters/valets were really friendly as well. Geraldines, the hotel restaurant was beautiful and served delicious food as well as special cocktails. It was too chilly for the pool, but it was really pristine and we enjoyed the fireplace at night. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend to our friends visiting Austin. Complimentary margaritas and wine for happy hour in the living room area of the lobby. Erin, in their commercial travel department, was extremely kind, and also a FSU alum! You will not be disappointed with this hotel."
2,No,"The shower got water all over the floor (due to it not having a door) yes, even when adjusting the head. When washing hands water would go all over the counter getting anything on the counter wet. They also have very thin walls and no insulation in them or the doors you could hear EVERYTHING in the halls and rooms next to us! Not what was expected when paying so much money for a room. It was like being at a motel 6! Ridiculous we had expected better quality from you all!"
5,Nice located hotel with contemporary touch,"Stayed for Thanksgiving holiday, our room was located in corner lake view with fantastic view, one of the best room 1401.Concierge and front desk very helpful and fast checking , hotel offers complementary drink between 5-6 pm, Restaurant is the best part of the hotel, with ultra creative dishes and fresh bread.We had a very good time and strongly recommend this fabulous hotel."
4,Thankful for Van Zandt,"My husband and I prefer to spend Thanksgiving either in another country or a road trip away. This time we chose Austin. We've been here many times before but, have never stayed @ HVZ; what a shame. This hotel is nestled in a quaint neighborhood down an alley and along the ""lake"". I've previously worked for Kimpton for many years and I'm familiar with their style and boutiqueyness; this property didn't disappoint. Unfortunately (to no fault of the hotel) we drove up to the sounds of a raging party at a very nearby condo. I thought we arrived on Bourbon Street. NOLA. I really hoped that would not interfere with our plans of quiet relaxation (it didn't). The valets and doorman were genuine and courteous. The room (Suite Eloise) was just like the picture. The bed super comfy. The full view overlooking the ""lake"" and City view was stunning (so much so, we slept with the curtains drawn). While the soaking tub did the job, it was made of fiberglass and not porcelain/marble.:/Unfortunately, there were minor downsides: We booked over the phone and rec'd an email conf. however, after a long line to check-in, the FD agent couldn't find our rezzie. He was very apologetic and resolved the situation in a timely manner but, this added more time of exposure to the obnoxious partying nearby. The restaurant staff wasn't as professional as one would expect from a luxury hotel (""Do you have a Thanksgiving Special?"" ""Yes"". The end) same goes for the cafe.Pssst...Don't forget to look up as you enter and wander about the lobby.Overall, wonderful getaway and would return in a heartbeat!"
1,"Unkempt, not maintained dump","Upon checking in as a ""special"" American Express Cardmember I noticed the check in desk was dirty. Went to our room, dropped our bags and went off to family for pre-Thanksgiving. Upon arriving back that evening, noticed the plaster around the window in the bath was all cracked and coming out. The window had clearly been leaking. Ceiling and wall ceiling around the closet all cracked looking like water damage. Then saw slop on the wall. Then some gross looking stains on the side of the bed. Then noticed the headboard was falling apart, gunk on the rug, food stains on the drapes. We left."
5,Great Hotel,This hotel is really unique in Austin. The trombone chandeliers are a cool feature when you walk in. The cafe downstairs is really cute and even serves some cocktails. The rooms are very nice and clean. They are simple but stylish. This is in a great part of Austin and you can walk to almost everything!
5,The Joule of Austin,"This place reminds me a lot of the The Joule in Dallas, but with an Austin flair. Go-to place when I need a place to stay in Austin. Very hospital staff, even made my dog a bed at check-in. Got to love the 5pm happy hour for guests as well. If you're trying to go out to Rainey St., can't think of a better spot. Excellent stay! I'll be back. Thanks!"
3,Good but not worth the price,"I think what you are really paying for here is location. If you don’t want to pay a taxi the extra $5 to $10 to go to a less expensive hotel at 2am then this is the place to stay. The staff was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The cleaning staff was in the halls every time I left the room and the halls are narrow so I always felt like I was dodging them. No big deal really. The decor was not my style. I am sure it is cool to some but the dark motif and faux barn wood in the rooms made it seem sort of dirty and dingy. There were little details that were overlooked like the pumps on the shower bottles didn’t work. Again no huge deal but it all adds up.The only thing that really made me unhappy was the lack of a crappy coffee maker in the room. I have stayed at everything from a motel 6 to an Aman resort and there is always coffee or tea in the room. Sure it is almost always crap but it gets me through the first 30 minutes of the morning.In conclusion- all in with parking paid $535 for one night. That is just too much for what you get, personal tastes aside."
5,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for business for two nights. The staff were really great and helpful at checkin. They managed to squeeze me in for an extra night at the government rate which was not originally available after I told them I would have to switch hotels on the second night because I needed a government rate.The room was well appointed and clean. Bed was comfortable. The rooftop pool was great, I thoroughly enjoyed a nice swim and relax on the deck after a long flight. I didn’t try the restaurants but they looked good. There is free coffee in the lobby.Would definitely return and recommend!!"
5,Comfortable place,"Van Zandt is the best hotel in Austin , TX. I have stayed there while on a business travel. The staff and the general manager are really professional and kind. The place is very clean and quiet. The view from the top of the hotel is amazing."
5,Food and drinks,"We where staying real close to this hotel and stopped by a few times during our Austin stay. We will probably book rooms here next time in town based on our experience with the staff that is super friendly.Also the resturant has a jazz brunch each sunday, and it is such a cool thing. The food was also really nice and high quality.But the main thing is still the staff that we experienced as real friendly in a real way. You do really feel welcome at this place even if you just stop by for lunch. Great vibe to the place."
5,"Great staff, great hotel, convenient location'","I loved this hotel from the moment I arrived. The staff were all so friendly and client-oriented. You could tell that they were trained to take care of the guests and it all seemed came across as very genuine. The beds were comfortable, the pool was a great space, the social hour margaritas were delicious and the location was perfect for wandering down to Rainy Street for fun bars and restaurants. I was there first for a weekend with a girlfriend and then a work gathering and it was the perfect spot for both."
4,Hip hotel in a good location,"This boutique hotel met our needs for a group girls weekend visiting Austin. The staff was very friendly ( especially Nick at check-in who assisted me as I had arrived earlier than the check-in time) and helpful.The pool area is great but the bar seemed to be short on staff in the afternoon and evening ( on a Saturday). The ""froze"" ( frozen rose wine) in the lobby shop was a fun cocktain. Rainey Street was just next door with fun food trucks and bar hopping. South Congress Street shopping was an easy 10 minute UBER ride. I would highly recommend staying here if you are up for a weekend out on the town in Austin. ps- there were, really, no young children to be seen or heard which was fun for a grown up mom's weekend out on the town."
4,Great staff,"From the doormen to the concierge everyone we came into contact with were super nice and helpful. We had a spa room which was large and inviting, if a bit dark in spaces. The bathroom was a travelers dream."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment.,"Unless you are a member of the Karma program, the wifi is not free.This is no longer acceptable.When are hotels going to charge from hot water, also?It is a shame because the hotel is friendly, so is the restaurant despite very little, and expensive, bites.No breakfast before 7:00am, don't leave early!"
5,Great Hotel!!,It is a beautiful hotel with terrific staff. The staff provides answers to any questions and bends over backwards to make sure you have a great stay. A terrific place to stay. Convenient to great bars and restaurants. A great pool and great amenities. Will totally stay there again!!
5,Nice! Great Location! Please another Restaurant! Parking $43! WOOOW!,"It is a great hotel, cool décor, amazing location, in the middle of all action! Valet parking outrageous ($43/day) like every parking in Austin hotel. The service was excellent, spacious rooms. Of course very PRICEY! But of course this is Austin. Only restaurant is Geraldines, this was my second time in that restaurant, very uninteresting menu and the food is blaaah! Trying to be creative and failing miserably. Hotel management please get another chef!"
5,Fun in Austin,"Loved this hotel, great service, lovely helpful staff. Food and atmosphere at Geraldine's was fabulous, entertainment was good too. Terrific location, easy to get to off the highway, easy to walk to 6th and 2nd for some nice shopping. We had a lot of fun staying at this hotel, thank you to the staff who made our visit memorable:)"
5,Honeymoon Heaven,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. Even though we live in Austin, it was like being on a deluxe vacation and we wish we could have stayed longer. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic and luxurious place to stay for any occasion, but especially if it's an occasion you don't want to forget. It's location is perfect for walking to local spots with great food and music. We also dined at Geradline's - the hotel restaurant and the food was delicious. Don't forget to take advantage of the top notch in room dining with a 24 hour menu. Perfect for late night munchies or in our case, breakfast en suite! Treat yourself to the spa room and you won't be sorry. Everything about this place is 100%"
4,Comfortable Hotel,"I recently stayed while on business travel. The room was very clean, comfortable, spacious and quiet. Service was great and they serve a complimentary happy hour each evening. (I was essentially offered a complimentary glass of wine while checking in!) There was no coffee pot, microwave or refrigerator, but when I called the front desk they promptly brought me a coffee maker. The hotel was within easy walking distance of a number of really good restaurants as well as food trucks. I would definitely stay again."
4,Beautiful Hotel Off Rainey Street,"I stayed at the Van Zandt because my sister lives in an apartment right across the street. This hotel is so pretty - you just want to hang in the lobby, which they make easy to do by offering a happy hour with beer, wine, margaritas, and a snack from 5-6! We were there during ACL so it was very expensive. There was a fridge in the room but it's stocked, so you can't use it to store your own drink. I will definitely stay here again - and hopefully not during ACL so the price will be more reasonable!"
4,Fabulous personnel!,"The bed was good. The room was good-sized. The restaurant was wonderful: small bites, and the ceviche taco was excellent.What made the location outstanding was the personnel. Our bellman, Sergio, was enthusiastic and tracked down all kinds of recommendations for us. Adam, the concierge, also made excellent recommendations for meals, and printed out lists of activities in the area. When we said we wanted a steak dinner, he asked what exactly we were looking for to create the best match."
5,Awesome and Unique Hotel in Austin,"This hotel has such a cool ambience and music themed decor everywhere. They even have music playing under water in the pool. They have an awesome free happy hour in the lobby, friendly staff, live music in their restaurant. It’s a great place in a great location. It’s expensive but I thought it was worth it."
5,Nice upscale hotel,Nice roomsGood serviceThe property is excellent. I gave an excellent rating but this is not a Five star hotel. More like 4.5 stars. It lacks the extras that a five star hotel would provide. A few things are lacking such as:Turn down serviceUpscale barFive star restaurant.The surrounding area is a work in progress. Lost of fun bars frequented by younger patrons. Restaurants are blocks away. The area will most likely be very cool in about five years. Lots of vacant lots close by but entertainment and good food is only a short Uber ride away.
5,Excellent Boutique Hotel,We were in Austin for US Grand Prix and booked this hotel which is right off of Rainey St which is a strip of Bars/ Dinner options. Hotel was located just a few blocks from 6th St and other chain hotels. Staff is simply the best! Very friendly! Rooms are very comfortable and do have some sound proofing because Rainey is very noisy on weekends!!!!!! we did not eat at hotel other than coffee shop which was good.
5,F! Weekend @ The Van Zandt,"This was my first stay at this property, the leaders provided a very well assembled team who ran a great show with a full house in a full town. For me it was a happy stay & I am a satisfied client. We will stay here again."
5,Kimpton Van Zandt rules!,"Great hotel with the best vibe, in a cool area! I love the vibe of this hotel. They offer a chill, daily happy hour from 4-6 with the most amazing margaritas and record player with some awesome vinyl to choose from. Being waking to Rainey Street is another perk of the location of this hotel. It's definitely worth a visit!"
4,Well designed contemporary hotel well located in funky district of downtown Austin,"You get a warm and welcoming feeling from your first encounter with the valet. All staff is friendly, well trained and knowledgeable. The hotel just has a great energy with a strong emphasis on customer service. the pool scene is energetic and attracts a younger crowd of 30 somethings, but not at all stand-offish. Geraldines is a great bar/restaurant with live music and the lobby happy hour daily at 5 is fun with beer wine and margaritas-all gratis. Only had a couple of small issues-shower design a bit faulty and flooded the BR and we came back from a day of hiking at 4:45 and room hadn't been made up. don't let that dissuade you, this is our second visit and we wouldn't hesitate to go back"
1,WOW absolutely the worst,"I never write bad reviews it comes from the Southern if you don't have anything nice to say...In this case I have to.We arrived yesterday and the valet and what we can only assume were front door employees were racing eacheachotherother in the only drive way in front of the main door to the hotel while the other valet filmed it on his phone. They did not stop when seeing our car but continued to race down the driveway and only when their playground racing had finished walked slowly back to our car.Ok, rough start but it is ACL this week end so we thought maybe it is just a little young play we will keep optimistic.We arrive at three and check in is for four but we are told our room will not be ready for another two hours at least. So, thats Five pm! They take our # and say they will text us when it is ready. They never texted us to tell us the room was ready and at 5:30pm we decided to check, it was ready and for who knows how long?We waited because we had a meeting in the lobby.Fast forward to upstairs suite, phone doesn't work, no free wifi and there is a clump of black hair in the shower.Did I mention this is a SUITE and they want to charge me daily for wifi.I have allergies so I am used to doing without things but they have one place to eat and a very limited selection coffee bar with extremely limited options for a person with my disease. Celiac / Gluten FreeBreakfast, empty and we still had to get up and get the hostess to refill our coffee cups, server MIA. Smallest frittata on the planet and pre-bottled pressed juices. So yeah, not great there either but not terrible average with really inattentive staff.Husband gets text this morning because they have his number from check in; asking how we are enjoying our stay. We let them know all of the above and receive prompt text saying manager will call us it is now 10pm. Still no call. Phone still doesn't work in room No room service or anything because we can't call anyone LOLToday when we were leaving for a lunch Jordan an employee of the hotel was blocking the elevator with a luggage cart and asked if we were going down, (in my mind: well yes Jordan we were before you hijacked our elevator and then put your cart in front of us.)I enter the elevator and Jordan says ""It wasn't a trick question"" as though I didn't move fast enough for him.Truly it's as though everyone here has had zero training in hospitality. Every interaction is worse than the next.This morning before leaving I see housekeeping in the hall and informed them of our fur pet in the shower and let them know we would be out of the room so they could go in and take care of it.Get back to our room today at 4pm after being gone all day and the room was not cleaned *remember the manager is also aware of the problems in our room at this point.Chase down another housekeeping person who I then tell I want my room cleaned.Go to the bar to give housekeeping time to clean and come back to get ready for dinner, bed made looks like minibar has been handled, phone still not working. Get in shower the black hair ball is still in the shower.So I would not recommend this hotel. This hotel is lacking in service, care and management. The staff are untrained and uncaring."
5,THEY CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PREFERENCES,5 stars across the board. They really try to accommodate and make your stay special. I stayed in room 1503 and the customer service is 5 stars. This will be our go to hotel in Austin. They really try hard to honor every customer preference.
4,Great Hotel in Rainey Historic District,"If you're looking for a hotel close to the action in downtown Austin look no further than here, Right next to the many bars and restaurants on Rainey Street, within walking distance of Metro's downtown rail service and Iron Works BBQ. Throw in Kimpton's signature wine, beer, margarita social hour and you be glad you booked here. If you can get a room on a higher floor overlooking Lady Bird Lake."
5,Great stay,This hotel is very stylish and accommodating with a very welcoming staff.My wife had just build sunflower seeds in the floorboard of our car and when we returned to use our car and short time later the valleys had removed all of the seeds from the floorboard without being asked.
3,Repeat guest dissatisfied form the first time,"My third stay at a Kimpton (previously stayed in SF and Boston hotels), this was my first bad experience. Our room was not ready for nearly 2 hours and no one seemed terribly concerned. My time is the most valuable commodity I own and if you don't care about wasting it, that's a big problem for me."
2,Poor customer service,"I was expecting this to be a nice hotel but it turns out I expected too much. We arrived the 1st day of the ACL fest and got to the hotel about 1pm. The check in employee did not smile as she offered to help. I asked about early check in options and she unpleasantly said I had two options, 1) to upgrade to the same room type with a different view for $50 extra per night and it was available now, or 2) I could check my bag and then wait up until 4pm to check in and we would receive a text message when the room's ready. I took the 2nd option. We left the hotel and 25 minutes later I received a text that the room was ready. I'm not sure but it sure seems like a blatant grab for an extra $50 night by getting people to agree to an earlier room. I checked in and was asked about my bag and was told it was being sent up to the room. We arrived at the room, no bag, waited 20 minutes, tried to call front desk and no answer after letting it ring at least 20 times. I went back to the check in counter and my bag was right there next to the original unfriendly staff member. I grabbed it and went back to the room.The rest of the stay was uneventful and we were out of the room most of the time. Nothing special about the room, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice and clean.On the morning of checkout I tried calling the front desk to get the checkout time and again I let it ring at least 20 times with no answer. I was able to find it online, we checked out, I said to email the receipt.When I got home and checked my email receipt the next day (today, Monday) I found I was charged for 3 nights of parking at $43/night, even though we checked in Friday and left Sunday and only stayed 2 nights. I haven't called yet today to get it fixed so we'll see how that experience goes.The hotel was expensive due to ACL fest and the hotel's reputation, but I could have stayed somewhere for quite a bit less with just as good a location or better, and especially with a better customer experience. I won't stay at this hotel again. I do like the Kimpton hotels I've visited in other cities."
3,Door mechanisms are loud,"Even for heavy sleepers, you will hear every door open and close on your floor. For the price point, it’s unacceptable! The hotel says that they are aware and attributed it to being a new hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel isn’t so new that the issue couldn’t already have been resolved. Comparable properties (JW, Fairmont, etc.) don’t have the same issues."
5,Wedding Night,Everything was terrific! I could not have picked a better place to enjoy our wedding night. Your building is extremely beautiful but your staff is what truly separates your hotel from all others. I will certainly be back.
5,"Love, Love, Love the Van Zandt","What a classy hotel.Did a 10 night trip around Texas and the Van Zandt was a highlight of our trip. Got upgraded to corner suite 1301 Eloise on check in after paying for a standard King, wow, what a lovely room and bathroom. The view down the river was pretty spectacular, it's just a shame it rained for a few days of our trip. This unfortunately meant we had no pool time but the pool area looked great. Geraldine's bar was a favourite, just wish we'd had more time in Austin to enjoy the music there.So convenient for Rainey Street, I'm sure rooms on that side would get noise from the Rainey Street Bars, but there was no noise from our side. Walking distance of the bat colony and 6th Street.The free coffee in the morning and margaritas/wine at happy hour was a great touch. Really hope to revisit if I'm in Austin again. Only gripe was the expensive valet parking but already knew about that."
5,"Trendy, upscale hotel with thoughtful service and amenities","Great place to stay for fun or work. Coffee shop inside hotel, restaurant and bar on the rooftop with live music. Beautiful rooftop pool area. Super dog friendly. Great customer service at every point of contact. Only negative for me was the huge pocket door in the bathroom. It weighed literally around 100 pounds and was difficult to open with the residential sized handle. Otherwise a great experience. Will definitely stay here again soon!"
5,Great place,"Fantastic hotel! Great location, very nice rooms and terrific staff! Loved the complimentary wine and we made full use of the bicycles available for guests. Pool is very nice. Cannot wait to come back!"
5,Luxury in the Rainey Street District.,"We had a reunion here and all everyone talked about, after catching up, was how wonderful the beds were at the Van Zandt. These large, bright rooms had great views, wonderful rain showers and terrific bedding. They even had a flat iron for my use during our stay, since I’d forgotten mine and Austin’s humidity is notoriously awful.The pool is beautiful. Jets of water spray into the pool at intervals along the sides. A pool side bar serves special concoctions while you relax on the divans. Towels are available poolside.The restaurant is superb. I loved staying at this hotel."
5,Fantastic Austin hotel,Great hotel with an amazing pool. Cocktail hour also fun. And just a short walk to amazing bars and restaurants. Hightly recommend staying if you are looking for a fun hip hotel close to the action. Sammy at the pool bar is fantastic!
1,Superficiality at its best,"It took three requests to get my room cleaned. When it was ""cleaned"" the only thing completed was my bed was made and my business receipts thrown away!!!! they left the ironing board and iron out and the dirty robe. Really so they were only interested in throwing away my reciepts that ended with me losing money because now I can't pursue reimbursement. I got lip service from the staff when I reported it immediately. No response. Their concern appeared superficial and I am now out more money. Plus it is $40 to park your car."
5,Austin Adventure,"Other than the noise coming from outside the hotel ...Friday and Saturday night, (rainy street) our stay was FANTASTIC. Amazing gorgeous hotel and super great staff. Not sure how you can let your guests know about the Fri and Sat night noise coming from outside the hotel. But this could possibly aleviate some of your problems?"
5,Wonderful Pet Friendly Hotel,"Very nice, modern, clean hotel that caters to pet owners. The staff was wonderful and made sure we had a dog bed and bowls in our room for our fur baby. The 5:00 happy hour with complimentary wine, beer and margaritas was also a nice touch - and pets are invited!"
5,Treated like Royalty!,The most accommodating hotel ever. Happy hours and dining experience all great. The hotel bar and entertainment was excellent! Every staff member was helpful and went out of their way to make our experience comfortable and memorable!
5,Fabulous,"A really wonderful hotel! Absolutely loved everything about it! The rooms are stunning, the service fabulous and the pool and bar top level! Great location! I was overcharged for a second night when I checked out a day early but trust this will be sorted out!"
4,Great for Hipsters & Boomers Alike,"The Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt is a place that manages to be stylish & comfy at the same time. The decor is sleek but the materials are natural. It is well located and you can easily walk to the Rainey District or to Congress Street. Geraldine’s Restaurant was good for breakfast and beautiful space. For a spectacular view ask for room 1501.The front desk has service very together. Not so much for valet service which seemed totally overwhelmed when we were there. Geraldine’s has a great bar & lounge. However, service was spotty at best. Champagne was warm & flat. The fried chicken sandwich tasty but cold. The next afternoon no service whatsoever in the lounge. You had to order your drink while standing at the bar & take it to the lounge yourself. While there seemed to be five bartenders on duty, catching the eye of one to order a drink was no easy task.This could be one of the best hotels in Austin but it will never get there if it doesn’t sharpen up some of its service areas.."
4,Warm welcome,"The thing that struck me about this hotel was the friendliness of all the staff , warm genuine hospitality. The hotel is comfortable, very on trend and clean. The surrounding area is very fashionable with lots of bars and restaurants . A good place to stay ."
5,Contemporary Fun,"Great location, modern room and friendly, professional employees. Seamless check-in. Comfortable accommodations and vibrant bar scene. The hotel was bustling and guests seemed to be enjoying their weekend there."
3,Close to Convention,"We stayed at this hotel for a convention we were attending. One of the team found a special rate on the hotel and notified us of the stay. I will say for what we paid it wasn't a bad deal, however there is NO way I would have paid or justified the price for the room for regular price.While trying to rate the items below the system would not let me do anything other than Excellent- while the over all hotel was fine, I wasn't happy with the bed or the comfort. Just wanted to let you know"
5,The Best choice in Austin!,Hotel Van Zandt is a fantastic location. Nestled into the popular Rainey Street area this Kimpton hotel provides you with entertainment within 30 yards from the front door. Rainey is a very fun and funky area for all out of towners to check out. It's very safe and you can relax knowing your room will never be more that .25 miles away no matter how far down Rainey you should choose to venture. The roof top pool is to die for with awesome views of the city! You can even watch the Infamous South Congress bats swarm from the bridge in the evening. I recommend the burger at Geraldine's and my wife had the shrimp toast salad. The pool wait staff is fantastic! Make sure not to forget your room key as you can not travel on the elevator up or down with out it. It's annoying but it's safe. I would most definitely stay here again when visiting Austin!
5,Hotel Van Zandt - A real gem!,"Wonderful decor, service and amenities. Rooms are spacious and welcoming. Lobby has plenty of room to make everyone comfortable. Great exercise room. Lovely Happy Hour. Free bikes! Make sure you ask for a room away from the elevator, there are three on every floor and they chime all of the time."
5,Birthday Trip 2017,Hotel was great and very CLEAN!! Staff was super helpful. Will absolutely come back!! Beautiful rooms and great location.Sammy at the rooftop bar was great.Reggie was also kind And helpful. Bar and pool were fantastic.
3,Difficult Review - Please Read,"We generally loved the Van Zandt. It's hip, cool and modern. It has a generous lobby with ample seating, the rooms are well appointed and the vibe is happening.The staff was outstanding and trying to resolve our issues - they are attentive and caring, and total professionals.We checked in on a Sunday for four nights. Unfortunately, a large convention also checked in on Sunday for three days. We were turned away from using the pool twice, breakfast twice, lunch twice and dinner once because the convention had those spaces reserved.It was a complete mob scene at times. It surely impacted our stay. We thought about checking out after two nights, since we were unable to use pretty much any of the property amenities by that time.The hotel location is adjacent to Rainey Street, which is a really unique entertainment area.The staff was very helpful in trying to resolve our disappointment, but there wasn't much that could be done during the heart of the convention.It's a great property, but it's not large enough to accept large conventions without adversely impacting its other guests."
4,Fancy (and expensive) hotel,"You get what you expect from the Van Zandt: fancy design (everything is on brand), clean rooms with great views, and friendly staff. The location is convenient and you can walk to downtown in about 15 minutes. Note: there is always something going on in the bars, shacks and restaurants around the hotel, thus expect a lot of young people there (-> millennials, I feel really old already). Also, you can definitely hear the music on a Friday Night!The usual complaints: wifi should be 100% free and included (without any required signups). You can self park your car in the nearby garage for $20 overnight (instead of $40 for valet). There is no coffee option in the rooms (why don’t you guys get some great Nespresso Machines). It’s annoying that the use of the elevators requires a key card. Coffee downstairs is ok, and a croissant almost $4 (seriously)"
3,Wonderful Venue; Food Disappointing,"Attended a fundraiser at this modern decor hotel. Great vibe, clean, comfortable/inviting sitting areas, fun chandeliers.Food was presented well, but, sadly, was not good. A variety of of pizzas, although creative, were overcooked and dry, and tasted as if they had been prepared a day or two earlier. A variety of finger foods in mini-cones passed out by friendly servers were mostly cone and lite on stuffing. The sliders had too much bread, small meat (prime rib (?)) offering. Simply, lots of potential, poor execution.The deserts were good, but nothing ""wow."""
5,LOVED it!,"We stayed in a lakeview suite and were treated like royalty. The room was beautiful with every amenity including a beautiful free standing tub. The room service was terrific, not to mention the free margaritas at happy hour and the free bicycles in the lobby. AND we loved having breakfast by the pool each morning. We recommend the Van Zandt to anyone wanting a fun hotel and wanting to be treated like a valued guest."
3,Good potential - but failing in the extra,"Excited to visit this hotel - had high expectations! I was not satisfied and will try another hotel next time. Sloppy housekeeping, cold and not so inviting areas. The outdoor/pool area have such a potential - but was so disappointing! Dirty - random - sad.Breakfast was unimpressive in Geraldine. Coffeeshop - good for coffee, but nothing else. The food is really not impressive at all - I would rather go without.Small touches could do a very big difference."
5,Love this Hotel,"I have stayed a few times. Most recently for a day trip to watch a Longhorn football game. Great location with a row of great bars and food a block away, though you won't hear the ruckus from your room."
5,"First visit to Austin which was, with the Van Zandt a real hit!","We stayed four nights here in a gorgeous corner king with views down the lake towards downtown so you could watch the sunset and see the bats ascend. Bed was the best I have ever slept in, Geraldine's was excellent with great service which we found everywhere, the happy hour drinks were fun and we thoroughly enjoyed borrowing the bikes and cycling the ten miles circuit around Lady Bird Lake. We also thought the Cafe great for breakfast, excellent cofffee, and tasty sandwiches and croissants. We are quite some way north of 35 in terms of age but we loved it."
5,"Love the Brand, the Austin Version comes with a GREAT restaurant","Love the location, a little away near the river but walking distance downtown and to the convention center. It won't be out of the way long with all the growth. The restaurant is called Geraldine's and it's creative x10. Tapas prepared by food art geniuses back in the display kitchen. Art and science man. Art and science."
4,Overnight Austin Visit - LeMans Races,"Very swank hotel, comfortable, conveniently located. Friendly smiling staff. May be a little pricey, but beats an ABnB when traveling with my family of 4. Located right of Rainey street which is a great place for dining, afterhours, good music."
2,Very poor value for money. Geared to millenials.,Didn't live up to reputation of a Kimpton hotel. Wouldn't stay again if went back to Austin. A dreary place geared to people under 35. Much less expensive more luxurious places to stay in city. Restaurant small food with big prices. Whole place very loud. No place for decent breakfast in hotel.
5,Keeping Austin Weird in the Best Possible Way,"The overall ambiance and feeling of the Van Zandt is quirky, yet extremely luxurious. Every detail is impeccably executed on the property and the staff is warm and welcoming. A must visit if you are looking for a unique stay in ATX"
3,"2nd time, a little disappointing overall...","We stayed here a year ago and liked the vibe of the hotel and the location (right off Rainey St.) so we booked here again. We enjoyed our stay but had some issues. The room key cards, which are used to access your room as well elevator, pool area, etc., didn't seem to work all that well. It was frustrating when the cards did not work with several tries, had to get one of ours updated when we could not get in our room. I was unable to get the card to work while leaving the pool area via the side entry (near towels and baths). I know the cards act as a security measure on the elevators, which I can appreciate, but having to pull it out every time I want to use the elevator is a hassle especially when your hands are full. Coffee in the lobby is not very good (in my opinion) or hot for that matter. The mini-bar fridges are stuffed so full so you really can't use them for any thing you may have purchased off site, drinks, leftovers, etc. The ice buckets are also extremely small so putting drinks on ice was difficult. Pool is nice, we spent quite a lot of time there, but we noticed a sewer smell towards the back side several times during our stay, not sure what that's all about. Bed was good however bureau drawers are very shallow. Staff is attentive and friendly, loved the happy hour music. Rainey Street was a nice spot for food (lots of options) and music. A short walk to the convention center and Lady Bird Lake. Probably stay somewhere else in Downtown next year."
5,My Austin Experience,If you are staying in Austin. This is the hotel to stay at... walking distance to 6th street. Beautiful swanky Hotel has all the amenities. Look for Sergio he was helpful and knowledgably with the area and the hotel. Close to everything.
5,"Great people, excellent hotel management","I really screwed up my reservation, doing it on my iPhone, and somehow managed to reserve a night before intended. Before leaving Dallas and while pulling up my conf email to load my GPS, I noticed the error. I called immediately. The team member listened, showed concern, and immediately made sure I got another room. Then, they gave me instructions on whom to talk to about the mistake. Lastly, I heard from the GM himself, Mr. Joe Pagone, who worked with me to resolve my error in a most gracious & understanding manner. They won me over and this was the kind of care that engenders client loyalty. Could not have been more impressed. Thank you! Very professional presentation, great location!"
5,HVZ Wedding,"My husband and I had our wedding reception @ the HVZ. We made a weekend of it for both our families traveling from out of town. Everything went off without a hitch. The convenience of the restaurant and cafe puts everything within arms reach. Not to mention that the customer service the staff provides, as well as the quality of the hotel itself, made the weekend unforgettable for us and our guests."
5,Great party hotel,"This is a great spot in Austin for those looking to party.The hotel offers free drinks in the evening in the lobby and has live music, The restaurant on the 4th floor also features live music. The pool is located on the 4th and is a fun scene with a bar and nice view of the city.The hotel is located adjacent to Rainey street - which has bars, restaurants and food trucks and a lively nightlife scene.Rooms are spacious and well furnished. The workout room on the 3rd floor is also well furnished with newer equipment. Room service offers good food and it comes quickly!Overall, this is great place to stay if you're looking for a fun weekend. You do hear noise at night from surrounding Rainey street places (I was on a higher floor), so I wouldn't necessarily pick this place if you are looking for quiet."
5,Vibrant Austin-Rocker Vibe Hotel,"Everything exceeds expectations. From the moment you drive up to Valet to everyone greeting you and offering cold beer or beverage of your choice. Amazing Ambiance, food vibe and exceptional pool side service and mind blowing restaurants and events. Its a must stay!"
5,Great Weekend Spot,We had a great experience - across the board - and look forward to our return. The room was really comfortable and had a nice view of the lake. Pool area was fun. The service was great. We liked the menu offerings and craft cocktails by the pool and at Geraldine's. We will definitely be back.
5,Loved it,True to Austin attitude and culture. Modern industrial design. It was an amazing feel with a great rooftop pool. All the staff was friendly. The rooms were clean and beds super comfortable. It is right next to a few bars and patio lounges that you can walk to. We didn't get to enjoy the two food truck lots with tons of options because we had no idea of the gem right there. It was literally around the corner half a block. Everything you need for the Austin experience is at this hotel and the space around it. Highly recommend
5,What a nice surprise,"We booked a room here in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey when the Houston airports were closed and my husband got booked for his return to work flight out of the Austin airport. I honestly chose it because it was inexpensive, close proximity to downtown, etc but didn't even have time to check TripAdvisor. It paid off. This hotel was close to the highway and while it sits on the outskirts of downtown the area that it is in has a lot of what Austin has to offer. There was a food truck court around the corner and lots of small quaint pub/restaurant establishments around the corner on Rainy. The nighttime had vibrant music and an active vibe. The hotel itself was quite the surprise though. Decorated in what I would refer to as steam pinkish Chic, the people really make this hotel awesome. 15 minutes after checking in our check in agent Sophia texted us to make sure everything was okay. Between 5-6 they have a gratis happy hour with beer, wine and really yummy margaritas (we had three each). Although we didn't bring our doggy on our quick trip, this hotel is very welcoming to fur babies and even the people that work there familiarize themselves with your pet. I heard doormen, front desk an valet refer to pets by name. It was awesome. I was very impressed with Geraldine's (you have to try One Night in Bangock for a pleasant surprise - and the bartender readily gave me the recipe). Friday evening there was live music that was awesome and on Sunday my brunch was quite nice and complete with freshly made butter and jam for my toast. We will definitely be back. Oh and PS, when I got back from dropping the hubs at the airport at 4:30 am and was a little sick to my stomach from all of the stress, within 5 minutes I had four pepto bismol tablets. Never had a hotel go to that length before."
3,An interesting but expensive hotel...,"We stayed in the Hotel Van Zandt in early August for a conference. I'll start by saying we're from Western Canada and had no idea how hot Texas can get! I've heard it would be in the 40's at that time of year, but never having experienced that type of heat before made me somewhat ignorant to it until we arrived. Wow, Texas is hot. Thank god for good air conditioning at the hotel! I was there for a conference so stayed at the HVZ, as that is where the conference was.Pros:Nice, clean hotel with modern furnishings.Close to Rainey Street which had some interesting bars and food trucks. The bar scene was mostly used by the 20 somethings and we didn't spend any time there. However our room backed on to Rainey Street as well so we heard everyone having a good time until the wee hours of the morning. That part was a con.Nice pool with friendly wait staff.Very friendly front desk and concierge staff. Front desk staff offered a cocktail upon checking in and the concierge always opened the door when they saw us coming - great service!Walking distance to a lot of nice restaurants and interesting shopping areas.Happy hour each evening was a nice treat - complimentary wine or beer from 5-7pm.Cons:The hotel room and conference rooms were very dark. I couldn't see well enough in the bathroom to do my makeup, so had to take the makeup mirror to the window to see what I was doing. The hallways are either painted or wallpapered black. It was too dark for us and we didn't appreciate that much.Although it was great having poolside service, it would have been appreciated to be informed that the mimosa I was ordering in a red solo cup size glass was considered a double and were $26 USD each. I might not have had 6 of them had that been the case! :) We found the food and beverages very expensive at this hotel and when converted to CDN $ the prices were very excessive for what we received.We went to the cafeteria restaurant one night after dinner to purchase a little dessert item, and found a cake that was just a smidge bigger than a cupcake that we were going to share, but decided against that when we found out it was $25!!!Overall I think this is a nice hotel, but overpriced and very dark."
4,Fun weekend in Austin,"The hotel came highly recommended from some friends, so we decided to give it a try while in Austin. From the wine we were offered at arrival to the freshly brewed coffee in the lobby the next morning, we were graciously taken care of. The hotel had a cool, hip vibe to it, but not too young as my husband and I felt very welcome and comfortable. The location of the hotel is fantastic as it's a block from Rainey Street. Enjoyed all the hospitality that Austin had to offer. We will definitely stay here again when we come back!"
5,Great hotel with spectacular service!,"We loved everything about this hotel. The public areas and the rooms are beautiful and very clean, and the service was top-notch. I tend to find at least some minor complaints with most hotels, but this one was amazing!"
4,Convenient and Nice,"The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is do-friendly as well. Great location and comfortable rooms. Convenient to restaurants and clubs, and the valet parking is very efficient."
5,Unique Austin Experience,"Loved our stay at the Hotel Van Zandt. The ambiance and service was like a boutique hotel, but the amenities were that of a large establishment. Food excellent, drinks at the pool- amazing, service unmatched!"
4,Great hotel during day time but not at night,Excellent location for business trip near downtown. The hotel and room was modern and staff was great.If you are looking for quiet place at night to have a good sleep then it is not a place for you.......
5,A must stay in Austin,"Amazing hotel with a quirky feel - great music vibe and amazing staff. Great location in Austin in an emerging part of the city. Cant say enough about the people at the hotel, very helpful and nice. The wine and margaritas at 5 PM in the lobby was a winner, great music and a chance to interact with other guests. Pet Friendly so they are on my list of perfect hotels!"
5,Best hotel experienc in a long time,"Excellent employees, impeccable service, wonderfully unique experience, cool bar and restaurant...Decor is very NOW....Everyone has a can do attitude...Enjoy the rooftop pool and workout in a state of the art gym...This hotel clearly exceeded our expectationsBeware of the valet fee...excessive @ $43"
5,Great stay,"Stayed here for a work trip. The staff was great, room was nicely appointed and the meeting facilities were excellent. Lots of unique amenities here like free bikes and evening complimentary happy hour. Location is the only thing lacking. In a rougher part of downtown but there are some very cool bars nearby. Will stay again."
5,Great hotel & great service,"We traveled to Austin with our 2 bull terriers for my birthday. From the start we had a great experience with Sergio setting up our dog kennels & him getting us ice. Once we were settled a chocolate mousse cake was sent to the room for my birthday on the house! The room was spacious, modern with a living area and a great bathroom, big shower with a deep soaking tub. The room service burger was awesome. There are cool bar/restaurants right next to the hotel. I can't say enough nice things about this hotel & their service."
5,Perfect hotel for our anniversary celebration,"We celebrated our 41st wedding anniversary and chose the Kimpton as home base for a great weekend in Austin, TX. The hotel has excellent contemporary design, super friendly and efficient staff, great comfortable rooms (always clean with neat amenities), a wonderful 4th floor pool with outside bar, happy hour (5-6pm) everyday with beer, wine, and killer margaritas, and Geraldine's - the hotel restaurant. If you are into contemporary design, check out the chandeliers!! They are made from recycled brass instruments. Also, the 2nd floor art portraits are exceptional! The hotel is located just south of the downtown buildings and convention center, and is located next to the river. Lots of restaurants, bars, and music within walking distance (<10min). We walked along the river path to the Austin Museum of Science and Nature to view the eclipse on our anniversary date 8/21. Great venue with families enjoying the museum, the science displays, and the eclipse. We passed 2 kayak and paddle board rental shops on the river. Lots of folks enjoying the eclipse in the middle of the river.Speaking of friendly staff, we got A+ treatment. Thanks Wayne and Sam. And better yet, we received great recommendations for dinners. We enjoyed outstanding dinners at Emmer and Rye, Geraldine's, and Cafe Blue. Each of these restaurants were ""performance art"" food places. Also, since we could walk everywhere, we valeted the car with the guys at the hotel. They were super courteous and quick. It was well worth the expense to insure the car was safe and well looked after.Lastly, the Kimpton Van Zandt hotel and Geraldine's host live music most evenings after dinner. Monday night we listened to Jackie Venson. Wow!! If you've never heard of her, you will. She's a young guitarist who plays way beyond her years. Watching her play guitar was like watching the senior rock masters. Remember Frank Zappa's ""Shut Up and Play your guitar""? Well that's what it was like watching Ms. Venson.For my money, this past weekend in Austin at the Kimpton Van Zandt with the great food and music is what's keeping this 60'something old baby-boomer young!"
5,Great staff and very nice hotel,"Stayed in Austin for business during August. It happened to be my girlfriend and I""s anniversary. So we stayed in Austin an extra night and booked a room at the Van Zandt. The room was great, the view was amazing… the first night was so enjoyable that we ended up booking another night... Victoria at the front desk went the extra mile to make our trip A memorable one. We will definitely return."
5,Comfortable and hip,"I stayed here recently on a business trip and was impressed. The first impression was improved when I was offered water or beer (!) at the reception desk. The rooms were spacious, modern and quiet - an excellent combination. Despite the proximity to lively Rainey Street (around the corner) I didn't hear much street noise at all. Being able to walk to the restaurants, bars and live music on Rainey St. is a huge plus and was definitely a highlight of the stay."
5,Great Austin Property,Hotel Van Zandt is a great property for those traveling to Austin. Walking distance to most amenities. Great staff. Fun pool. I highly recommend Hotel Van Zandt for anyone visiting the Austin area!!!!
5,Bachelor holiday,"A group of 13 of us stayed in the hotel for 3 nights/ 4 days. We all absolutely loved it.Reception were extremely helpful with advice or anything that we needed. They were also very patient and understanding. Not once did they get angry with 13 English guys having fun at the hotel.The pool is brilliant with good music, cocktails and food served throughout the day.The rooms are clean with large bathrooms and walk-in showers.I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel."
5,Jeremy K stay at Van Zandt,"My girlfriend and I frequent Austin often, traveling back and forth hear from time to time about one to two times a weekend from Fort Worth, as much as I loved my stay here the one and only issue I had here was not being made aware of the 40$ per night charge for parking overnight at the hotel, had i been made aware of this i would of had no issues. In the future I won't be staying here again just due to not being made aware of the parking fee, Im not upset over being charged it's just not being told about it. Other than that, my stay here was awesome."
5,Pool,"We got a cabana at the pool for a bachelorette. Drinks and food were great. Sammy was our waiter and was amazingly. He was incredibly accommodating, providing impeccable service. He went above and beyond even bringing me a bag of ice for my injured knee. All of the staff there was great and the over all vibe was chill. I would recommend to anyone."
5,Great stay!,"We really enjoyed our two night stay! Location, service and accommodations were exceptional. The staff was super friendly, professional and accommodating. When we come back to Austin, we will definitely be returning to this property."
5,Great Service and Beautiful Hotel,"I met up with some friends for a few days of relaxation. We decided to wait for an upgraded room to give us a little more space. Although we waited longer than expected, the hotel staff were extremely friendly. It felt like a very ""adult"" hotel, which was nice. The pool area was quaint, and a little smaller than expected. Although small, it didn't cause a problem as it was just a place for the adults to sit and hold drinks.I would recommend this hotel, and can see myself going back."
5,Trip,Over all great trip! Love The hotel and all the free perks! Great staff and pool! Location is awesome!! People recognize you and make you feel special. Especially when you first check in. You can't beat the experience and you have live music in the hotel and great spots right next door on Rainey st.
5,Amazing,stop looking and just book your trip. The best shower and bed experience of my life. Th pool is great and the staff is terrific. The hotel has many strategies in place to make a guest feel appreciated. The social hour changed my trip experience as a lone traveler.
4,Very Nice,"I really liked this hotel and would stay there again, however be forewarned that the valet cost is extreme, the pool is open only during the daylight hours and we were upsold when we checked. Other than those above points, everything was really nice and would have given a 5 if those three items were corrected."
5,Awesome place in a great location,"I thought the Kimpton in Austin was absolutely first class. From the live music in the restaurant/bar on a random Wednesday night to the attitude and approach of *every* staff member I interacted with at the hotel, this place is really and truly first class. The location was also awesome, with the only potential downside being that it is a bit of a magnet for bachelor and bachelorette parties (which is comedy in its own way, and there weren't any room parties that I heard so it wasn't a disruption - more just the comedy aspect of watching a real life Beavis and Butthead show how poorly they could hold their liquor)."
5,First visit,"We come to Austin several times a year and typically stay at FS. Decided to try something different this time and it did not disappoint. Trendy fun hotel with great service! Loved the hotel, room and service! Geraldine's has fantastic food too. Pool was quite the seen. We will be back!"
5,Wedding Venue,"Totally geared for excellent wedding experience. Facility great for art deco, vintage, modern, or traditional weddings. Staff on top of every detail, attended to details I didn't know I would even value, food delicious, location a plus."
4,Trendy Fun in Austin,"Really beautiful hotel with a cool vibe. Reminded me of Soho house in Chicago. Had a very business crowd during the week and not a lot of kids. Pool was small and crowded with drinkers so unsure if this is the right choice for a family stay. I am a huge Kimpton fan so stayed here despite choices better suited for touring UT campus. Had other appeal though. Absolutely fabulous restaurant that is not to be missed even if you do not stay here. One piece of advice. Bar has music every night and although I was on 15th floor and they were directly below me on 4th, I could hear it very clearly. Avoid by picking other tower if you will not be at the bar. Great staff as always."
5,Surf Austin!,"A birthday trip to Austin Texas we stayed at Kimpton Van Zandt. We were there to try out Nland man made waves surf park or stay at the Kimpton was awesome! Great hotel great staff, kitschy swank awesome room. I highly recommend"
5,If you go to Austin you need to stay here,"Close enough to 6th, but no real need to stray from Rainey St. This hotel knows how to treat their customers. I would not recommend for families with small children, but if you are there to see bands and check out the Austin night life you can't go wrong."
5,Modern and unique,My wife and I enjoyed our stay and the staff were pleasant and professional! We had a slight problem with our breakfast but the hotel swiftly fixed the problem and made sure not only our concerns were met but also made the rest of our stay flawless.
5,"Great Experience, Great Value","The Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt met and surpassed all expectations. Welcoming staff, dog friendly, and unmatched atmosphere and ambiance. This hotel reflects the Austin, TX experience with a touch of class!"
5,Exceptional Stay at this hotel!,"The outstanding guest services at this hotel keep bringing us back. We stayed here for our wedding night and were treated like royalty. Just celebrated our one year anniversary and experienced the same exceptional guest service from the front desk to the staff at Geraldine's (our favorite restaurant-we're locals) to the staff at the pool. Service, food, cocktails are exquisite. Not to mention the room. Highly recommend Hotel Van Zandt."
5,Stayed in Austin,"Stayed in Austin at the Kimpton hotel fantastic location excellent staff made us feel at home - nothing was too much trouble - Great food at Geraldine's , Great atmosphere at the pool deck - Will definitely stay at Kimpton when I'm back in Austin"
5,Great Romantic Getaway,Had a great stay ... Everything was top-notch .. .from check-in all the way through check-out. Friendly customer service; great location ... right next to Rainey Street. Don't forget to check out the bicycles and ride along the lake.
5,Very classy,This place was fabulous. Just here for 1 night but the staff were very pleasant and the decor was beautiful. We enjoyed the complimentary cocktail hour and the pool at dawn! The parking is a little annoying but overall a great place to stay.
5,"Fun, trendy hotel","I booked this hotel for a bachelorette party and it didn't disappoint! Sydney checked me in and checked up on our group our entire stay which was so nice! Everyone was so accommodating and met all our requests and answered all our questions and provided tips on things to do, places to eat and even where to find erotic baked goods for our party haha! They went above and beyond to make our stay memorable! The pool had a fun atmosphere and Sammie was the best server! The decor was beautiful and the food and drinks in the restaurant and bar area were delicious! The location was perfect also! We could walk to GOOD restaurants and food trucks and bars! Our bride was very happy with the hotel we chose and that's most important! Even when I got an overnight parking charge the staff took care of it right away considering I didn't have a car! So I can't stress how wonderful all the staff was!"
4,"Clean, spacious and excellent location","We very much enjoyed our hotel room at the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt. We had a corner king room that had a nice view of the river and a view looking toward the University. The rooms were clean, the bedding was nice, although the pillows were unfortunate. We requested a coffee maker and extra towels before our stay and they accommodated with no problem. Service here is excellent. The pool was small and loaded with people, but it was over 100 degrees, so I can't really blame the hotel for that. The restaurant service was great! The vegetarian choices were abysmal, however. We were shocked at the lack of quality of the food, especially at the pool. Just because people are in bathing suits does not mean they are looking for a less ""special"" dining experience. Being a vegetarian in Austin was almost impossible, save for a couple places in town. With more and more people preferring to eat less meat, there certainly should be someone in the kitchen who is creative enough to figure out a decent dish. The chips and salsa were laughable - from a bag and a jar. I recognized the Tostitos flavor immediately. The hotel decor is impeccable. We really loved the look of the common areas and the coffee shop had some of the best iced lattes around. The wine list was awful. Just so airport. There are so many boutique wines out there, why put on one from the grocery store? Special shout out to the excellent valet team. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable."
4,Great overall,"This a very well balanced property. Has a good location, easy breezy on the eyes/ambience and very spacious rooms. The only glitch- the service, but may be it's because of the Hotel's sacrosanct culture.Nevertheless, my experience was good largely and would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting good ol' Austin. The rooms as I mentioned before are the prime attraction here and offer great space, great views (quiet and tranquility), the hygiene standards are good- and the washroom was pretty spacious as well. Their food spread is good as well, especially their burgers-taste damn well. All in all good value for money if you decide to give this place a try."
5,Hip Trip,My husband and I lucked in to this hotel on a travel website. It did not disappoint overall. Decor is trendy and staff is on point. The only frustration we had was trying to find a seat at the pool - it was obviously the place to be!
5,Geraldine's is a fantastic way to start and end your day at the Kimpton Hotel Van Zandt!,"In short, we stayed here two nights for a friend weekend. It was a lot of fun but there are some key things to consider if you're booking a room:1. The pool is GUARANTEED to be so packed you likely will not enjoy it2. Pack spending money - picture of drinks are $60 each!3. Geralide's is simply amazing! Every meal was spot on and the service was exceptional.4. Check your bill! Upon leaving I discovered that I was over charged at the pool deck -- it seems a waitress added $15 tip to my bill.5. We read a lot of complaints about their valet system but honestly, it was great! Their text system was fantastic and the car was always ready in a timely manner."
5,A great trendy hotel,"If you want a fun trendy hotel right in the heart of downtown Austin this is the place. There are clubs, live music and restaurants all around and easy to walk to. It's right next to the convention center so business by day and party at night!"
5,You can't go wrong at a Kimpton property!,"Fun, vibrant, young, plush hotel. We loved everything about this hotel. The location, the pool, the food.... Free happy hour??? So awesome! The burger on the pool deck was incredible and the location cannot be beat. We will be back!"
3,Very loud!,Positives - 1. Nice view from room. 2. Nice view from pool.3. Room was clean.Negatives1. Bed was not comfortable. The W has much better beds!2. The walls are thin! You can hear everything from the street and the rooms around you.3. They promote pornography! For that reason I will never go back to one of their hotels.
