5,INTA Leadership Meeting,"I‚Äôve stayed at a lot of conference hotels, and i‚Äôm usually disappointed at some point during my stay. I‚Äôm pleased to say that this stay has been one of the most enjoyable conference stays I‚Äôve ever had. Bravo to the entire Fairmont Austin staff!"
5,Cleanest hotel room I have ever stayed in.,"I recently had occasion to stay at the Austin Fairmont Hotel for a professional meeting and was very favorably impressed by the quality and cleanliness of my standard room accomodations. Having stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years, my accomodations were distinctively excellent and remarkably clean. In addition to my room, my initial registration encounter with their registration host, Carter, was warm and consisted of a highly professional welcome and introduction to the hotel."
5,Makes even a work trip a pleasure,"The Fairmont is fairly new and everything seems fresh and pleasant. The rooms are pleasant with large windows, sufficient lighting (on dimmer switches), a Nespresso machine, a full length mirror in the closet, a bathroom with lighted mirror and magnified, lit make up mirror, and glassed-in spacious shower--i.e., all the basics that are all too frequently missing in many hotels. The staff was gracious in all my interactions. The highlight for me was definitely the spa and salon. I squeezed in an excellent massage with Sky and the best pedicure I have ever had with Ni. Seriously. My toenails looked so smooth and the surrounding great after all her trimming, filing, and buffing, I thought about skipping polish--but she had proposed such a pretty color, I went ahead, and it‚Ä¶"
5,First time Austin visitor,"Great property, location and F&B. Could dim the lighting at the main lobby bar somewhat. The Gold Club access was more than worth while, very convenient and again very good selection of F&B throughout the entire day."
5,Fantastic stay on Gold Level,The staff at the Gold level desk were attentive and welcoming. Sebastian Trudeau in particular was great. The chef making the omelettes made excellent omelettes and the breakfast service in general was just right.
5,First Rate Experience,The Fairmont Austin did not disappoint. The staff and service was outstanding. Would absolutetly recommend this hotel to tourists and business travelers. The hotel was conviently located in the downtown area and right across the street from the Convention Center. Easy access to wonderful restaurants and bars.
5,Fairmont Excellence!,"We were very pleasantly surprised with the degree of service and attention to detail throughout the hotel. We‚Äôve stayed at our share of conference hotels around the world, and this was by far one of our top experiences ever. The club was nothing short of exceptional. The concierge at the club was extremely knowledgeable and gave good recommendations and direction. The entire hotel is aesthetically very pleasing."
5,Fairmont Austin always delivers,"This was our third time to stay here and this property always delivers. Property is beautiful and staff truly cares about customer service. Also appreciate how much sound-proofing the rooms have, as I'm a light sleeper. Upgrading to the Gold level is also totally worth it just for the breakfast buffet alone."
5,Service at best,"The hospitality and service in this hotel were very surprising to me, i did not see it for a very long time in the states. food is really good and rooms are big and clean. location is quite good as well."
4,fine conference hotel,"very nice, but the little things need work. My in room coffee machine did not work. I even asked to have it replaced. They claimed to fix it. The machine still did not work. The elevators are often jammed. They did not anticipate the number of people that will be using them."
4,Great stay!,"Hotel grounds, room and restaurants on property were great! Attended conference here only negative was not a lot of additional seating to do quick lobby meetings. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Ate several meals at hotel from breakfast and lunch all were top quality and tasty!"
5,Great property!,"right in the center of everything. Great service. The room was impeccable. The ""little"" touches were noticed easily! (the bar had very nice unique touches, the guest room also, the housekeepers did a great job of cleaning)."
5,Elegance and Excellence,The people and the property at the Fairmont Austin are superb! The accommodations are great - rooms well appointed. The restaurant choices are many and all of the restaurants have excellent options. Conveniently located in the heart of downtown Austin so easy to get to various hot spots and just a stones throw from Rainey Street as well.
5,"Impeccable Service, excellent staff.","The Fairmont is definitely a 5 Star hotel. From the accommodations to the amenities to the excellent staff, everything was flawless. It was our 18th anniversary and everyone we encountered comped us something or brought a gift. I have to highlight a few individuals, even though they were all great. Our bellhop Collin Johnston was fantastic. He was so sweet w/ an infectious smile. He brought up a mini fridge for our beer and champagne and then he came back w/ a hand written card to congratulate us on 18 yrs, definitely above and beyond. Paul Remy at the front desk took great care of us and I didn‚Äôt get his name, but the assistant manager when we called also gave us impeccable service. We had a great staycation and really appreciate the staff."
5,A comfortable stay in Austin,"I liked the bed in my room. It was so comfortable even if the weather outside was not that great. The only thing that was not included in my room was an alarm clock and a radio; other than that, my room was alright with its BLUE motif design that suits me very well. The hotel is new from its inner and outer facade with a style that suits me well. I like the paintings on the 7th floor level and the color motif the entire hotel has chosen happens to be my favourite color, BLUE."
5,Lovely staycation!,Everything about our stay was perfect. The concierge Ryan A went out of his way to ensure we had a fabulous stay. All staff was incredible and it was quiet and cozy. Will definitely return in the future!
5,FABULOUS!!,"This was a fantastic hotel on all fronts. Service, accommodations, food, friendliness of staff all earned 5 stars. I will definitely stay here again when visiting my daughter at the University of Texas in Austin!"
5,Memorable Stay- BEAUTIFUL HOTEL AND AMMENITIES,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start... my experience from the moment I walked through the doors to check-in, from the moment I was checking out- was AMAZING My family and I did not want to leave!!! The quality and service is above and beyond from the bedding, service, Baby Bliss hair dryer, etc..The pool is so beautiful, you just feel luxury- they had a standup spray sunscreen machine üòÅAlthough the most memorable experience was went we had dinner at the restaurant- we were greeted by Alif Hornsby. He was well versed on the menu and was able to give recommendations. We ordered off the Happy Hour menu and was able to try just about everything off the menu and it was all flavorful. Alif is the type of server that leaves an impression- Fairmont Austin is so lucky to have someone like him represent this establishment, he exudes the type of top notch service. Went so far as to give us recommendations for, Things to do in Austin! Because of him.... we will not hesitate to come back when in town and even recommend this hotel!!I was impressed with a server from the coffee shop by the name of Ashley who took time out and takes to me about my line of work and share her story as well!! I love the interaction and the extra mile she tooküòâ.If you are a gym fanatic- the gym is everything you would ever wish for. The equipment is quality and plenty of space.I left this hotel with a smile and was quite pleased- see ya‚Äôall soon!!"
5,"Beautiful property, great staff","I stayed recently for a conference. The property is beautiful and the staff is great. Really impressed with the food as well. Proximity to the trail along the river is a bonus for a morning run. If it's in your budget, I'd recommend the Fairmont."
5,Fairmont Austin Lives and Breaths Accor Culture: SERVICE FROM THE HEART!,"I had an enjoyable experience at Fairmont Austin as follows:Check-In - Dallas was so accommodating and pleasant, fast, and efficient.Bellman - Collin was a fantastic listener, surprising for a young man that youthful (There is HOPE for his generation). He had some additional items sent up to him that I mentioned in our discussion.Bartender for Brunch - Michael Tucci: Was welcoming and able to multi-task well considering how busy it was. I was so hungry when I arrived, and the service did not disappoint me.The GEM of my trip by fare at The Fairmont Austin was none other than Mr. Mitch Cohen; this gentleman indeed was one of the most gracious professionals that I had the pleasure of meeting. I came into the Bar for brunch, and I had a hot chocolate, but by the time I was getting ready to drink, it had gotten cold. Mitch made it a point to say hello to the guests in the restaurant, and then he made his way over to me with a new cup of ""HOT"" hot chocolate. That made my day! Honestly, throughout my entire stay, I felt like I somehow regularly saw him because he was checking and making sure I was doing ok. I truly appreciate that level of service.Thank you also to Effy, Ashley, and the Good Thing Team! LOL loved that!"
5,Great Location and Beautiful,"amazing service, Love the location, Rooms very comfortable,and bed, very clean. Great coffee at the coffee shop. The Pool its great, with an amazing view. will stay again and again. Congrats to the Management!"
5,Love the vibe!,What an awesome hotel in the heart of Austin! I was there for business and notice the hotel is very busy with conventions and social celebrations. The Bar area is such a great place to relax. The Revue is a great concept to explore different kinds of cuisine. I had a great view of the pool area. Rules and Regs is also a fun place to hang out as it overlooks the city skyline.
5,FICP,"The hotel is stunning and the staff went above and beyond in every aspect of my stay. For out meeting the attention to detail, creativity, and food and beverage was over the top. This hotel is 5 star all the way"
5,Fabulous hotel!,We stayed at the Fairmont for a wedding weekend and could not have been more pleased. The hotel was immaculate. The service was great from check in to check out. Hotel bar was nice and the bartenders were very attentive. The attached ‚Äúfood court‚Äù was really cool and the food we had was amazing. The little coffee shop was great for a quick bite and drink in the morning. Nespresso machine in the room was a great perk. Great location with walking distance to all that downtown Austin has to offer. Live music in the lobby and complimentary cocoa and chocolates was really nice. Overall- exceptional stay! We can‚Äôt wait to go back!
5,Fairmont Gold,"By far the best hotel in Austin in regards to service and spa. I always stay in a Fairmont Gold room which not only gives you access to the lounge but allows you to check in at the Gold Lounge desk which allows you to bypass the lines downstairs. A major selling point in my opinion especially after a long trip. Check-in is always easy and I stay there so frequently that the staff there remembers me and makes it a truly personal experience. The rooms are beautiful, the beds are more comfortable, and the breakfast and canap√©s in the evening I think make it quite a deal."
5,Fairmont is Fairly Awesome,Spent a night at the Fairmont on business. It is new. It is nice. The service is great. The lobby bar is pretty cool. It is a short ride or a nice walk to good restaurants. Would definitely stay there again.
5,A weekend in Austin,"A weekend in Austin Texas. And what better place to be than the Fairmont a stone‚Äôs throw from Rainey St where it certainly does all happen! When you have eaten and drunk to your heart‚Äôs content, and listened to the sounds on show, the short stroll back to the comfort of the Fairmont is a great end to a fun-filled day."
5,Amazing staff,"Very impressed by the staff throughout my stay. They far exceeded my lofty expectations. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms and common areas were immaculate. Did experience some delays and congestion when using the elevators at peak times but it didn‚Äôt take away from an excellent stay."
5,Great Hotel,The staff were some of the nicest people. They really are in touch with the fairmont brand and look to make your stay exceptionally unique. The hotel is gorgeous in a great location. Would definitely stay here again
5,Great Stay,"Went with family , had a great stay. Execellent service from staff. On the down side I feel restaruant and room service prices are overpriced. Rooms are execellent, Staff is friendly and helpful.Enjoyed our stay!"
5,Always welcomed!,From the moment we drive up till we drive away we were welcomed. Met friends there for our 40th birthdays and the hotel and area did not disappoint! Spa was great. Everything was clean and smelled wonderful. Housekeeping was stellar. Breakfast was quite the experience!! Like no other I‚Äôve ever been to! Bar tenders were friendly along with restaurant staff.
5,Lovely Hotel,"great service, friendly & veery helpful staff, beautiful rooms and lobby, great breakfast and snacks. Only complaint the beds are too high and the sinks are also high., but great shower. The location was good and concierges were ever so helpful. I would definitely suggest the hotel as a must in Austin"
5,Great hotel!,"I stayed for the weekend with my girlfriends and had the best time at the Fairmont. Excellent spa experience with massages, incredible meal at Garrison, friendly and accommodating staff, and beautiful rooms. It was so easy to get around Austin from there too. All and all a perfect stay!"
5,Beautiful Fairmont Just Off The Beaten Path!,"Flew into Austin for a Saturday UT Longhorn football game. The hotel is beautiful, staff terrific, and view from my corner room spectacular. However, the best thing about the hotel is its location! It is very convenient to take a short walk just down the street to all of the nightlife on Rainey Street. Easy walk to the live music on 6th Street and restaurants on Congress. We took a Lyft to the game and picked up a couple of Bird scooters to head back to the Fairmont. Super fun weekend and wonderful Fairmont Hotel!"
5,Great property in downtown Austin,"Recently stayed here for a conference and thought everything was top notch. Hotel staff was lovely, food was great, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Gorgeous pool with view over downtown. Walking distance to many restaurants."
5,Great stay!!,I stayed here for a conference. Hotel was beautiful!- incredible F&B outlets- staff paid extra attention to detail- bedroom was very spacious- close to great bars- great check in and check out experience- felt very valuedShout out to Alessandro (Victor). He has the hospitality gene. Great attention to detail! He remembered my beverage and served it with personality. Also - great detail to have linen cocktial napkins. Very coolThanks Alessandro and Chris for making my evenings extra special.
5,First trip to Austin,"Traveled to Austin for my 50th Birthday. Our overall impression/stay at this Fairmont was excellent! Upon our arrival (for a reasonable fee) we were able to upgrade to a suite. The rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable... with wonderful views of the river and city.All encounters with staff (check-in, concierges, housekeeping etc) were friendly, helpful and accommodating. My husband I both had massages which (for the price) were not the best we‚Äôve had but still were enjoyable and relaxing. We enjoyed time at the bar and coffee shop and would definitely recommend this hotel."
5,Endodontics meeting,"I usually stay at the JW Marriott when in Austin, but my meeting was at the new Fairmont and I wanted to check it out...despite being a loyal Marriott / SPG member. I have converted to the Fairmont brand! At least Austin‚Äôs. I loved the overall feel of this hotel as well as their bar options, restaurants, and Spa (the best I‚Äôve experienced in Austin...typically I havnt found an Austin Spa that includes steam, sauna, AND hot tub...this is me doe. The solarium over-looking the skyline and lake is a plus. Staff was friendly. It‚Äôs the first bed I actually preferred to my own. Bonus is Rainey Street is right across as well as a walkway to convention center and rest of downtown. I‚Äôll be back with my wife/family!"
5,Director of group sales,"Very good overall. Staff was friendly. Felt welcome all the time. My favorite thing in the hotel was the f&b. The food was great. The last time night of the event, was just great. My kudos to the entire team and the executive chef"
5,Amazing!,"Beautiful property with all the perks of a luxury hotel‚Äîgood restaurants, spa and excellent service. I felt very well taken care of during my stay. Highly recommend for business or pleasure. Will definitely return."
5,Beautiful option in downtown,"Recently stayed at the Fairmont for a large conference. The hotel and service could not have been any better. Staff that couldn‚Äôt do enough to make sure you were comfortable and enjoying your stay. Beautiful rooms and excellent food & beverage. One criticism is that there were no outlets on the desk to plug in laptop but other than that, couldn‚Äôt find one thing wrong. Loved it."
5,Exceptional Staff,"This newer property in Austin made me feel pampered from the moment I arrived. The staff is warm, welcoming, and care about their guests. The rooms are well appointed and upscale. And the banquet meals are far from ordinary. Thank you Fairmont for a memorable stay!"
5,Great hotel,"Went to Austin on a quick turn visit for business. The Fairmount hotel was perfect for the purpose. Clean, fast, and upscale. It was an excellent value. The bed slept well and the bathroom was large, spotless, and well thought out. I‚Äôll be back many times."
5,"Friendly, helpful staff; spacious, well-appointed rooms; excellent amenities","Fairmont Austin is centrally located and ideal for the business traveller who values convenience, top notch service, comfortable rooms, and a terrific choice of dining and lounge areas - all at a reasonable price."
5,An excellent Fairmont experience,"If you're in Austin for business or pleasure, the Fairmont is a great hotel for your stay. I was in town for a quick business trip and my company arranged my stay for me. Having stayed at other Fairmont hotels, I was glad to see that hotel name on my itinerary! The Fairmont Austin lived up to my Fairmont expectations for service, cleanliness, and overall comfort. I enjoyed dining at one of their restaurants for breakfast, too. The location seemed convenient if you're attending an event at the Convention Center, and it was just a short walk to where I needed to be downtown. It might be a little out of the way compared to other hotels right in the heart of the city, but I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again."
5,Fabulous Place To Stay In Austin,The Fairmont is a gorgeous hotel - conveniently located - with a staff that goes out of their way to help! Highly recommend! Their restaurants are fabulous too! Don't miss the 7th floor bar - the view is amazing. And the coffee shop in the lobby has cute gifts & quick bites that are delicious.
5,Best and most bang for your buck,"Stay at Fairmont for less than $250 a night, don‚Äôt spend the $400 a night and more at four seasons and have a wonderful stay!! Great views at 30th floor and higher, beautiful restaurant and bar. Wonderful rooms and great showers. Staff are super nice and accommodating. Also connectedTo Austin convention center by walkway which was great when it was raining."
2,Poor Choice for Business Travelers,"Poor value for the money. As a business traveler, I wouldn't stay there again. Did not provide an invoice for quick check out in morning and front desk was grossly understaffed. Still trying to get an invoice - they literally did not answer the phone today, when I called, rang and rang. Fairmount reservations, when they finally answered, couldn't provide an invoice either, said to call back to hotel (that didn't answer phone!). Pretty amazing for a allegedly premium hotel. Upcharged for internet, also kind of shameless for a $340/night room. Cheap (knock off) Keurig-like machine merely crushed the pods, no coffee. Good Lord, I've had much, much better business service at modest motels! You'd think they could stick an invoice under your door, like pretty much any motel chain has figured out how to do."
5,Excellent!,"Hands down one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. I attended a work conference at the Fairmont Austin and was impressed from the moment I arrived to the moment I checked out. Comfortable beds, impeccable cleanliness, and first-rate service! I'll definitely be back"
5,Exquisite!,"Their newest property and definitely a GREAT property! Everyone and everything from day one until the final day, everyone was absolutely perfect. Two highlights, the bartenders went out of their way to make a cocktail that was not on the menu without hesitation. Then there was Effi(sp) in the coffee/gift shop, who was just as warm & inviting on day one as on day 4!! Cannot thank them all enough."
5,Great Location and Friendly Staff,Wonderful Hotel! The Staff was great and the overall experience from start to finish was delightful. I would definitely recommend this hotel chain to everyone. I really enjoyed my time away from home as they made my stay comfortable and entertaining.
5,Fabulous Hotel ... Wish I Could Have Had Their Robe,"First time staying at this hotel. Magnificent property. Tremendous views of the city. Excellent food. Outstanding customer service. Cool decor. Comfortable beds. A very nice place to stay. Only two negatives: 1) The hallways & conference room were very cold. Part of it was the outside temperature being very frigid but they never got warm. 2) I really wanted one of the Fairmont white bath robes that were in the room. None of the shops or spa had one available. Otherwise, tremendous stay."
5,Fantastic location and service!,"I love staying at the Fairmont when I‚Äôm in Austin. It‚Äôs got a great location with lots of restaurants within walking or quick ride distance. The gym is fantastic and I have bet tried the pool myself but my friends had an awesome day so I trust their experience also. This visit, I made a small request when I checked in and Roger at reception was able to accommodate, which really added to my stay! I‚Äôll be back in a month and am so looking forward to the serenity of my room (and a drink at the awesome bar!)"
5,"Great hotel, terrific customer service!","Great hotel, clean comfortable rooms (loved the shower), service was excellent. Location is convenient to all Austin has to offer. Short ride to the airport (always a plus). Would return next time I‚Äôm in Austin."
5,Beautiful property downtown Austin,"Beautiful property, very convenient. Check in was convenient and quick. Room spacious, well appointed and very clean. Modern furniture, great bedding. Beautiful downtown view with extra large window. The bar a little loud but otherwise very nice and lively. Did not use the restaurant. Self parking very convenient within the building (of course, Valet also available)."
5,favorite hotel in Austin,"Another great stay at the Austin Fairmont. This is a lovely hotel with friendly, well-trained staff. I will look forward to my next trip to the Austin Fairmont. This hotel is a great addition to downtown Austin."
4,Beautiful Leisure Hotel,"I visited Austin, TX on business to inspect several hotels. I stayed at the Fairmont Austin. The hotel was just a 15-minute taxi ride from the airport. Outside doormen were very helpful. The registration line was long with only 2 clerks working. The registration foyer is rather small so there was a build'up of people with luggage on top of each other waiting to check-in. The actual check-in process was smooth and the hotel is clean."
5,Here for a conference but love it,I had a very nice experience at the Fairmount Austin. I was here for a conference. The food was delicious. It was a large group but the hotel‚Äôs staff was very efficient and accommodating. AV was on point. The room was conducive for a good night‚Äôs sleep. Would highly recommend the Fairmont while in Austin
4,NOVEMBER 2019 ( My Bday Celebration),"First of all we want to acknowledge Candice from the reservations department, she outdid herself as she helped us to book the BEST rate and optimize of our Accor points.We went to Austin to celebrate my 40th Bday, and we couldn¬¥t have chosen a better place to stay. The hotel has a GREAT location! with over a 1000 rooms, yo never feel it is crowded ( just the bars, as they should bel!).At check in Jess, give us a floor upgrade to the 37th floor, with great views of the river and Rainey street. ( thanks Jess!!!)Great room overall (3731), nice size bathroom, closet, room space.On the not so great side: the room need more drawers. We made a comment on the water pressure to a staff member in the elevator and half an our later it was fixed!On my bday we received a chocolate chip cookie platter.Andrea ant Checkout was also patient and kind.We definitely recommend The Fairmont for your next stay in Austin. Great attention to detail, as they make an effort to get you to feel at home."
5,Review of stay at Fairmont,"This was the first time that I stayed at the Fairmont in Ausitn. My wife and i thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is beatiful. The empoyees are very helpful and cooperative. I liked the location of the hotel. All of this added to a very enjoyable one night stay at the Hotel.one more thing - I never received a copy fo the final bill, although i was told it would be emailed to me."
5,Great Business Destination,"I enjoyed my recent stay at the Austin Fairmont. The rooms and the staff were excellent - extremely helpful. Food was very good and the meeting facilities were excellent.The only issue or challenge, which isn't really their fault but something to work with the city is exiting the property onto East Cesar Chavez. If there was someway to reroute leaving the property that would be helpful but of course it is Austin and downtown traffic is crazy."
3,Sleek New Hotel - Not Ready for Primetime,"Stayed here for Formula One race as did many others. Management clearly did not plan for guests demands being clumped around race events. Breakfast wait was intolerable as was the check-in line. Shame since it is a beautiful, but very expensive hotel."
5,Going to the F1,"Great stay and loved everything, especially the food. It's a great place close to many things in Austin, and even staying at the hotel is wonderful and lovely. The spa was great also. If I go back to Austin, I'm probably staying there again."
5,Totally excellent,"Even more than you might expect from such a quality hotel, truly luxurious, fabulous decor and all services at top level. Highly recommend. Was the Grand Prix weekend when we stayed so prices at the high end but still good value"
3,F1 weekend,First time staying at this property - very nice hotel - service was weak - appeared they weren‚Äôt prepared to handle a sold out weekend - breakfast service in the restaurant was especially slow - lots of complaints by fellow diners.
5,"Excellent hotel, good location","It's definitely a high-end hotel. The location is not as central to the city but it is only a few blocks away. It is right next to the convention center though, so that's nice. I got a package deal, so my room rates were managable. Otherwise, this can be an expensive place to stay in. I guess you pay for quality. There was no bathtubs in the room (at least not in mine), which was the only thing I picked on. Also, there were not a lot of movie channels to choose from (if that's important to you), and the towel felt slightly ""cheap"" for a high-end hotel. But overall, I was very happy with my stay."
5,Fairmont Austin,"a great property in a perfect location. the fairmont always does a good job. the only issue is that the air conditioning was a bit louder than I am used to at Fairmont Hotels. Otherwise, the perfect stay!"
5,Great Place to Stay in Downtown Austin,"Stayed here for a conference. The hotel is has amazing decor, great rooms, great service, and the restaurants in the hotel even match up to Austin's reputation as a great place for dining. Would definitely stay here again."
5,What a GREAT Hotel! With AMAZING staff!,"I came to this hotel for a blogging conference in November and had a FABULOUS time! The hotel staff treated us all like royalty - they were all friendly and conscientious and helpful. Without being cloying or fake, of course - they all seemed genuinely eager to help!Our room was lovely and the view was great. Loved the pool, the bars, and the fitness room. I have no complaints.I came here for business but brought my sister along as a companion. She loved the spa and said her massage was excellent.The concierge was very helpful when were asking about walking vs. driving to certain restaurants etc.I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again next time I'm in Austin."
5,Beautiful New(ish) Hotel in Downtown Austin,"First time at this hotel and to the City of Austin. Location is great and within walking distance to everything in downtown, 6th Street, Rainey Street and the river walking path. Beautiful hotel design with lovely common spaces and well thought out and comfortable rooms. Though this hotel was very busy, our room was quiet. The service we received from everyone at the hotel was excellent and accommodating. Great pool area and very large and modern gym. We would not hesitate to stay here again when we return to Austin....and we will!"
5,Austin FAM,"The property is awesome; staff were friendly and courteous, culinary was AMAZING! Conveniently located and easily accessible. LOVE that you have an option for self parking on-site. Will be back again!"
5,Fantastic stay!,All the staff went above and beyond in every way. Dave and Jessica were extremely thorough and helpful with two separate checking for my family at check in and also with dinner reservations. Garrisons was outstanding and everyone there went above and beyond. The omelet cook was great and got my boys eating vegetables in their omelets! We‚Äôre definitely coming back and are already looking forward to it again. Thanks all!
5,Great stay,"Beautiful, clean property in a very convenient location. The staff was very accommodating and food was better than most hotels. Underground parking was extremely convenient in bad weather conditions. Would come back many times."
5,Comfortable and relaxing weekend,"We stayed three nights at the Fairmont, booked last minute after an AirBNB property cancelled on us. Staying at the Fairmont was so relaxing and comfortable it made up for the other hassles we had experienced!Our room was spacious and comfortable, especially the bed.The location was great- walking distance to Rainey St and other attractions.We did not use the hotel dining, as there were so many other great places in the area to try."
4,A Delightful Stay,The adjoining rooms were perfect. The beds and the bedding were excellent. Food was the only weak area. Room Service had to remake an egg order. The restaurants were a bit of a puzzle. Hard to tell which one had the food we wanted for breakfast or dinner.
5,A wonderful location for a conference!,"I stayed at the Fairmont Austin for a conference and I was so pleasantly surprised by how lovely this hotel is. My room was on the 26th floor and had a lovely view of the city. I would recommend the city-side view over the river-side view. So beautiful. The lobby of the hotel is colorful, bright and luxurious! Really enjoyed the Revue restaurant - had 2 meals there. Our server during one of the meals was Alif Hornesby and he was one of the most attentive waiters I've had. Great communication and suggestions based on each person's tastes."
5,A Wonderful Stay at The Fairmont Austin,This hotel was beautiful. It smelled divine. The beds wear incredibly comfortable. The food was unique and so delicious. The bathrooms were spacious and spa like. I can't say enough good things about this place.
5,USA f1 gp,"Fantastic hotel , staff were brilliant , nothing was too much trouble for them . Helpful on where to go and places to see . Lobby was a great place to hang out for drinks and meeting people . Rooms were spotless , just need a bigger shower head for the size of the shower ."
5,Excellent venue for an event,Great place. For an event or meeting environment was very very nice Excellent staff and hotel accommodations are excellent. Also Easy access tosurrounding restaurants and points ofinterest. Airport is a 20 minute ride
5,All around amazing!,Gorgeous property and amazing staff. Visited for a work event and enjoyed everything about the property. Very clean and very attentive to my needs as a nursing mom.... super accommodating to my need to pump!
5,Must eat or Dine at Garrison,It was amazing! The food at Garrison Grill was perfect. Never had food prepared that way.Small plates but extremely well preparedThe hotel is niceLove their brunch which is different as well. You order what you want to try!
4,Alif at the Revue Restaurant,We visited the Revue Restaurant for a quick bite before we went out for the evening and Alif (Hornesby) provided the most professional service. He recommended delicious entrees to try and he did not disappoint. He was very attentive and extremely friendly. He really provided us with a great memorable experience. So much so that we went back the next evening with family. Thanks again Alif for a wonderful stay.
5,Returning again and again,"We've stayed here many times since it opened last year. It's beautiful, staffed with friendly eager-to-please people and has the best concierge lounge we've ever seen. Definitely go for the Gold rooms!"
5,Amazing hotel!,"I was here during the Formula 1 weekend and this place was really fantastic. Great rooms, friendly and professional service, the swimming pool was really large and I had a great time at this hotel. 5 stars from me."
5,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a top quality hotel filled with luxury and top notch service. They have a great brunch, and delicious lunch items. The bar upstairs has a great view of the city at night, and the pool is really beautiful. The lobby bar has tons of seating and great environment to have a night cap."
4,Gold Stay was Wonderful,"The Gold Level stay was amazing. Excellent room, shower, turn-down service, cleanliness and more. The food was excellent both in the gold level lounge in the dining restaurant. The fitness center was well stocked and a great view of windows."
3,Nice property disappointing service,"I stayed Monday and Tuesday for Forrester event. Impressed with nice facility and friendly door bus boy and front desk. However, I left a plate w/ leftover food outside the door Tuesday night, can't believe it was still there Wednesday morning! Also I left my Oral-B electronic tooth brush in the room. Called first time when I found out after I got home. Front desk transffered me to ""Lost and Found"" (around Thursday 12am when I got home), the guy at duty said he doesn't have anything. I asked if he could check the room 3321 that I stayed, he said he/they would when there is no customer in the room, and ask me to call back next day, didn't take my contact number. I didn't feel he cares about my loss at all, he didn't seem to plan to make any effort helping me check further.For a hotel like Fairmont, I expect people would take proactive action to make sure customer has good experience at your hotel. I stayed at less of a hotel before that the lost and found service even mailed back my stuff left in the room.So quite disappointed of the service."
3,Fairmont Austin,"I stayed at the Fairmont for the F1 with the normal circus that comes with it. Was a good hotel, the location is right in between 6th street and Rainey Street but was disappointed with choice of restaurants in the local area, expected more choice if honest.Whilst i very much liked the hotel we ate in the restaurant for 1 night and the service was poor, grumpy waiter who couldn't wait to be rid of us.When i checked my bank account when i got back to UK, i saw that i had been charged near extra ¬£2000 on my card which shouldn't have been charged as the hotel was fully paid for in advance!!!Hence why I'm rating service as 2 out of 5 for this trip."
5,Great hotel,Great hotel. It's in fantastic condition. It has multiple great restaurants. It's in a convenient location to Rainey St. and to 6th Street. Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are new. Can't recommend it enough.
5,Excellent Stay,Just a wonderful stay at the Farimont Austin. Some great meals at the Revue and Garrison's. Perfect for Business. Excellent Room and even had Fox Business News channel on TV. Great Self Park. Great Location with close walk to Pete's Dueling Piano
5,Excellent accommodations and service,"I was here for a business trip. Rooms were clean, well kept and comfortable. Restaurants and bars were great, and service was superb. The hotel staff that worked our conference was professional and friendly. I will definitely return next time I am in Austin."
5,Dinner in Reveu,"Dinner was excellent and Alif provided the best service. He recommended appetizers and did not disappoint. He went above and beyond to provide a very memorable experience. If you are ever in Austin, stop by the Reveu and ask for Alif."
5,it's all good,"Excellent room and very comfortable bed. The hotel is connected by a covered walkway to the convention center in case it rains. It was a bit of a walk to the registration desk of our convention but all in all, it was good exercise."
5,Cool üòé Coolest hotel üè®,"Great location across the street from the convention center connected by a overhead walkway. Close to Austin‚Äôs music üé∂ venues on 6th street, shopping üõç and by the river which locals call ‚ÄúLady Bird Lake‚Äù seriously üòê it‚Äôs a river lol üòù. Hotel has great food, fabulous live music and excellent accommodations. Highly recommended."
5,Amazing property in Austin - would stay here again,"Even the best hotels have issues with service, room and construction quality, you see it all over. I have not seen one issue with the Fairmont, 100s across the board. The only one minor minor negative was that that water pressure could be stronger but i must qualify this as I love the water pressure REALLY strong so its more me lol. great property, stay here if in Austin."
5,Loved the Fairmont Austin!,"We stayed for the F1 race and enjoyed our visit. It was a busy weekend but the Fairmont didn‚Äôt miss a beat. The hotel is beautiful, the staff were very helpful, and the coffee shop made for a great start each day. We‚Äôll return for sure!"
5,Formula 1 Grand Prix Weekend.,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont Austin over the Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend. Every hotel for miles around was stuffed to the gills, as was the Fairmont. However, they never dropped the ball. Excellent service, great attention to detail and a willingness to help out any guest. the place was very expensive that weekend, but well worth it. the only snag we had was getting into the Revue Restaurant. The line was 40 minutes, so we went to the Moonshine for breakfast. That was also brilliant."
5,F1 weekend,"Enjoyed the hospitality of the hotel, the staff was pleasant. The breakfast bar, was great. Check in was easy and we arrived in time for the desert bar. Nice quite lounge to enjoy at drink watching the TV."
3,Not quite up to Fairmont Standard...,"I have not stayed at a Fairmont Hotel is a while, last one was in 2012 before I joined TripAdvisor. I remembered it as a solid brand for luxury, however in Austin I was very disappointed. The property was generic and rooms were poorly appointed, it reminded me of a Marriott, cheap scratchy linen and lack luster interior. Additionally, the walls were paper thin and I heard too much of my neighbors morning rituals. Additionally, the check out was a mess, with a line a mile long. There was a convention ending and everyone checked out on mass. With that said at least the staff were super helpful, especially the bar staff in the lobby."
3,NIce hotel but could not cope with the demands of the F1 race,The hotel is nice but could not cope with the demands placed upon it by the F1 race. Check-in lines were very long and it took a long time to get our keys. On both Saturday and Sunday morning we failed to get breakfast at the hotel. On Saturday we tried the restaurant but after waiting in a long line we were finally told it would be at least 45 minutes for a table for 3. On Sunday we tried room service for breakfast but were told it would be at least an hour. Even on Monday after 9 am it took about 10 minutes of waiting before any staff came to talk to us about a table and then there was a 15 minute wait to bus tables. Not a great experience for a hotel of this class. They did offer some compensation for the service issues however.
5,Tremendous hotel in downtown Austin,"The Fairmont is a wonderful hotel well located in downtown Austin. The staff was accommodating. The rooms were large, well appointed, and very comfortable. Our room was on an upper floor and the views were tremendous."
1,Worst service ever!,"We were there for the COTA Formula 1 event. How can you be so under-staffed during one of the busiest weekends of the year? why would you build a huge hotel if you are not capable of staffing it correctly? We had to wait for a table for over 40 minutes in the morning. We had to wait in line to check in for over 30 minutes. At over 600 dollars a night? Ridiculous. A Holiday Inn is better staffed.Staff was stressed-out, in a bad mood, and it¬¥s understandable, but unfair to them and the guests. We had to leave our table to go find the waiter. The waitress that waited on us on our Friday dinner at 8 PM, waited on us on our breakfast at 8 AM, how could she ever be in a good mood, she probably slept 4 hours, how can you treat your staff so poorly? And how can your staff treat us so miserably? Maybe I know why.But Michael Douglas was sitting next to us and he got a visit from the manager to see if he was doing ok. So you are selective on who you worry about. We were not the only ones upset and complaining, everybody was looking for their waiter to order, even to pay or to sign the check.We saw probalby 60% of the tables at the restaurant empty. The hostess said that we couldn¬¥t get a table becasue there was no staff to wait on us. Is this good for business?Never returning there."
5,Classy and comfortable,"The grand entrance, bar area and restaurant are all spacious and beautiful. The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and very comfortable. The beds are so comfortable, they are hard to get out of in the morning. :)Room service is prompt and good."
3,Not too bad...,Hotel lobby is very unattractive and has no feeling. Food at the restaurants is ok and overpriced. Biggest complaint is that check out is at noon and people knocking on my door early morning to see when I was going to check out...I had the Do Not Disturb out as well.Spa and gym are top notch and employee that works the nail salon at the spa is excellent.
5,Wonderful,"I can't say enough good things about this place. They said it's only 1.5 years old. Everything is new and shiny (and everything still works.) The lobby area is comfortable and convenient (though the decor may be a bit odd.) We had the buffet breakfast in Revue. Pricey at $24, but the most amazing spread I ever saw. We went late and made it a brunch. We went back to Revue for dinner. A fun vibe at night, and the food was excellent. The room was large, attractive, quiet, and comfortable Staff were friendly and efficient. Its a short walk to the river-front hike and bike path. If you ask, they'll give you a small map with the directions to the path written in. Do this, since otherwise, it's not obvious how to get to an access point. I'd go back to this hotel in an instant! The only drawback is the cost - but that's to be expected in a place of this caliber."
4,11/31/2019 - 11/2/2019,The property and room was very clean and well organized.I was charged for a bottle of water I did not touch or open which was pretty obnoxious. I didn't realize until I inspected my bill at home. Make sure to double check your bill before leaving the hotel.
5,Formula 1 fun weekend,Had a wonderful stay at another great Fairmount property! Very nice hotel with good restaurants and nice lounges with great entertainment! Great location to the popular Rainey Street which was especially fun on Halloween!
5,Incredible,Absolutely wonderful stay at this incredible hotel. Great staff with easy check in. Super comfortable beds and linens. Amazing breakfast with tons of tasty options. They also have a very good bar right in the lobby
5,Gorgeous Hotel Close to Everything,"This hotel is beautiful. The room was spacious, comfortable, and well appointed. The bed was the most comfortable I have slept on in any hotel and I was impressed with the overall feel and ambience of the room and the hotel in general."
4,Beautiful hotel. Service was lacking.,We stayed here for the GP race weekend. I am sure the hotel was closed to sold out. But everything was understaffed. They couldn‚Äôt seat people for breakfast because there were not enough servers (plenty of tables.). It took forever to get a drink at the bar. If you were seated at a table you had to scrounge up your water and head to the bar if you wanted a refill. Valet was 30 minutes. I appreciate it was a busy weekend but the hotel was not properly staffed for it.
4,"Great, new hotel - still working out some kinks","Overall, really enjoyed this hotel. Any issue we had was met with a team who really wanted to make things right, and did!Rooms were thoughtfully planned and had great amenities.Pool area gets an A+ (though it was too cold the day we visited it to try it out).Gold Lounge has great breakfast - a bit better than other Fairmont Gold Lounges we‚Äôve visited. We did notice several guests clearing tables (including us) in order to have a place to sit. Perhaps having more staff would alleviate this?Location is great to many downtown areas of Austin - so much to see and do nearby!Will stay here again!"
5,Wonderful Stay,The rooms were very comfortable and spacious. The restaurants and bars had great service and food. We enjoyed the live music in the main level bar. The bar on the seventh floor offered wonderful views of Austins sky line.
5,Exceptional,"Customer service was beyond belief Hotel staff was Friendly, fun and courteous. Rooms were clean comfortable and nice size. Amenities were plenty. Spa was wonderful. Great bar and couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. Conveniently located"
5,Fantastic Hotel,"Friendly staff, brilliant rooftop pool area (you could be in any number of tropical spots if you can ignore the nearby high-rises), well appointed room, good pool level bar. Cafe on ground floor is useful too. Never tried the ground floor bar as we were too busy checking out Rainey Street and Sixth Street during our two nights, but looked like it might be pumping in the evenings. Suspect a lot of people come to play in this hotel. Unsure if there was also a club in the hotel but wouldn't be surprised given the nature and lateness of the music we could hear (almost feel!) on our second night! Located so close to Rainey Street, and an easy walk to Downtown shopping and the bat bridge. Could possibly walk to South Congress as well."
5,Very good,"Rooms nice and comfortable, gym great, enpugh equipment, restaurant fine, lobby big and confortable, bar good atmosphere, people nice and great service, everything functions in the room, great detail with Nespresso cofee machine"
4,Great Austin Convention Center Hotel,"I stayed at the Fairmont Austin for a recent mortgage convention. While it is connected to the convention center via a walkway, getting to the registration area at the convention center is quite a hike requiring navigating across floors. The rooms are very tastefully done and the views, spectacular. The staff was extremely gracious and generally very attentive. However, there are a few things which are disappointing. The elevator service at times, was slow. The high end Nespresso coffee maker in the room had a power cord too short to connect to the wall! Despite three separate mentions of this problem over three days, nothing was done to resolve this in spite of someone from customer support calling me while the room was being serviced! For a hotel of this caliber, somewhat disappointing"
1,Terrible terrible stay!,"I have stayed at Fairmont‚Äôs all of the country. From Maui to San Diego, from Berkeley to Boston. My stay at the Austin location was one of the worst stays I have ever had at ANY hotel anywhere. Terrible service while dining in the hotel restaurant. Room service that was more than an hour for a CHILD‚ÄôS plate of food. Room not cleaned. Air conditioning not working. Elevators not working resulting in our entire party having to walk down 21 floors in high heels and formal dresses. The Association that I am the Chairman of specifically asked if we should stay at the Fairmont or the Four Seasons. I wished I had picked the latter. You have lost me as a customer."
5,A Star in Austin,"This is a wonderful hotel. The accommodations for our meetings were very nice. Music was provided throughout our event, which made it special. The rooms were very nice. We were not real impressed with the food choices. Not sure who chose the food, but much of it was too ""strange"" for our taste."
5,Austin Fairmont,Everything about my stay was fabulous. Love the spaciousness of the room from the entry to the wall of windows. I didn't feel like I was in a dark tunnel. I thought the desk area was a bit small. The staff is extremely respectful and polite and willing to assist. Beautiful property.
5,Thanks for the Stay!,"Fantastic service and great views! Rooms were well kept and the hotel key cards didn't deactivate when around cell phones. Wahoo! Also, the pool is amazing! Kudos to everyone at the Fairmont and thanks for the excellent stay!"
5,Di'ana Jordan,"Everything was truly excellent. Easy check in, friendly and helpful staff, fast room service (considering the hotel was full of convention goers), clean and fresh linens, great housekeeping staff! All in all an excellent experience. And it was quiet!!!"
5,An all-around great experience!,"The Fairmont Austin is a lovely hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, clean and attractive rooms, welcoming and colorful environment, good food, and prime location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Austin, whether for business or pleasure."
5,Exceptional service from the bartender,"5 out of 5 must stop by especially for the service, I was at the Revue bar sunday meeting with a friend and the bartender working that night was amazing. His name is kyle he was very knowledgeable about different cocktails and had impeccable timing and different ways to make drinks using the type of vodka I truly enjoy. If you stay at the Fairmont you really must go to the bar for an amazing time and great drinks."
4,Family wedding in Austin,The hotel is very nice. Great location. I would like a bar or area can sit without noisy surrounding so can talk. Both bars had live music and it was too cold to go outside and sit. Maybe this was just the tie we were visiting.
5,Convention hotel,"We booked this hotel for a major convention. The Hilton is on the opposite ends of the Austin - Convention location. The walk was significantly longer compared to the Hilton however the overall experience at the Fairmont made it worthwhile. Also, Many of the top execs stayed at the Fairmont which is very important. Overall, top shelf concierge experience you expect from a Fairmont brand."
5,In town for a conference,"The room and the hotel altogether were fantastic, very thoughtful touches like an umbrella appearing in my closet for a rainy day. I would like to thank William from the bell desk for outstanding service, my friend had a medical crisis with her back and he showed up with a wheelchair and a luggage rack and was HUGELY helpful!! We were very grateful for his timely and kind assistance. Would love to come back."
5,Amazing service,"I travel a lot, especially for business; Fairmont Austin impressed me with their service. From the moment I entered the hotel everyone was welcoming and helpful. Hotel is clean, modern, the rooms have super comfy beds and bedsheets. The Concierge desk was particularly helpful with whatever the needs were during our stay. Robert was able to get us into a very hot restaurant last minute, where we had one of our best meals in a long time. Overall a great experience."
4,A very nice place in Austin!,"The hotel is conveniently situated for the convention center. The rooms are well appointed and the lobby bar personnel are most gracious, however the acoustics could be largely improved... bring ear plugs!The front desk and the doorman folks are very on top of what the guests needs are and much appreciated. Thanks all."
3,Farimont Austin,"I was staying at this hotel in connection with a conference. While the hotel was nice I did experience a very odd and off putting issue with service. First our bank of elevators were down with no management presence to re-direct guest to the service elevators. Next I was awoken by cleaning staff at midnight as a card was slipped under my door by mistake. I was then awoken two more times at 12:30 a.m. and 1:00 a.m. respectively, once with a ruler and wire hanger under my door trying to retrieve the card then again by the housekeeping manager to apologize. Lastly when I finally had to get up at 5:30 a.m. to catch my flight I turned on the shower and there was no hot water. I later found out that there was no hot water on the entire 25th floor. I did report all of this activity to the manager at check out and called the front desk both about the midnight wake up and the hot water. This was not what I would have expected at a Fairmont property - I was just appalled and will seriously reconsider staying at another property,."
5,ALTA convention,"Hotel staff were very nice and amenities were good. Did not particularly care for the food served during the convention. Did like the Revue Restaurant, but did not care for the nicer restaurant (can't remember name). Bar service was good. Overall, the hotel was very nice."
5,wonderful hotel,The location is excellent. My husband and I stayed for a weekend getaway in our own town! We spent the weekend walking around the area enjoying walking along the lake and exploring food and cocktails of local bars and restaurants. The hotel is itself is very clean and modern and then staff was excellent. Enjoyed lounging by the pool overlooking the city and watching the world series with other guests in the hotel bar in the evening. Also enjoyed the spa and the facilities there. Very relaxing and enjoyable. Great stay at the Fairmont!
5,Great Stay!,"Excellent customer service. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Even though there was a huge convention going on there, our rooms were very well insulated and our floor was quiet. Rates are compatible with other hotels in same range. Will continue to stay here."
5,Comfortable stay in a good location!,"Walkable you‚Äôre Rainey St and downtown restaurants. Beautifully decorated hotel, well appointed fitness center, and clean updated guest rooms. Friendly and accommodating staff. We would stay here again."
5,Fulton Bar at The Fairmont,This huge open-air Bar with Gorgeous decor and very comfortable seating creates a very inviting atmosphere. They always have live music and make absolutely amazing cocktails. The service is impeccable and it is always a great place to relax and meet friends. You can always have dinner and one of the many restaurants in the hotel that are the very best that Austin has to offer. Located in the heart of downtown in the Fairmont Hotel The Fulton bar is one of my all-time favorites.
5,Di's,"The hotel was really nice - the gym was great, not crowded and very clean. - i just couldn't the ice machine - but then I didn't look very hard. We had several great meals/ the breakfast was yummy. The hotel was close to everything."
5,Beautiful hotel,"Great location within walking distance of numerous great restaurants and terrific running path along the Colorado River. Beautiful hotel with outstanding views of the city, lovely rooms, coffee shop in hotel, and great service!"
4,Modern Upscale Downtown Hotel,"The Fairmont was fantastic and we had a great stay. It is a beautiful hotel with very friendly and efficient staff. We chose it however because it was the location of a conference and also connected to the convention center for another conference. My only complaints are that I booked online requesting a fridge and it was not in the room when we arrived. This was resolved very quickly though with a call to the front desk. My second complaint is how overpriced their breakfast menu was. $21 for a 2 egg breakfast! I mean, IHOP is across the street and it‚Äôs less than $8. The atmosphere is not enough of a draw for the extra $13. I mean it‚Äôs kind of hard to screw up eggs. If you are looking for a big breakfast then their brunch is a nice option, but for all the business people looking for something quick before conferences and meetings, it would be nice if there was another option. My last complaint is that the maid somehow forgot to empty our trash 2 days in a row and once left her cleaning cloth on the desk. It was as if she was interrupted mid-cleaning or something.One other nice thing about this hotel was they do have a hotel limo/ car service which will take you within 1/2 mile of the hotel (drop off only), first come first serve availability. This was a nice feature. Overall the Fairmont is a great choice."
5,Excellent Experience,The hotel is beautiful and rooms are outstanding. The spa was the highlight! Audra in the nail salon was not only amazing but was by far one of the most professional and friendly people. She knows great customer service!! Kevin who did my massage was also outstanding. Professional and very accommodating. Would highly recommend!!
5,Beautiful Hotel,"What a gorgeous hotel! This hotel is elegant and beautifully appointed. The lobby, rooms, and restaurants are all top notch and the rooftop pool is beautiful (although it was crowded on the weekend). Be sure to check out the exercise room and take advantage of the driver who will drop you off anywhere within a mile of the hotel (we did tip him). The service was also fabulous. I highly recommend this hotel!"
3,"Beautiful property, great food, lacking on service","We moved to the Fairmont after the original hotel we had booked for the weekend lost all hot water. We booked a suite as we were celebrating our anniversary. The hotel itself is really beautiful - the public areas and the rooms. Probably one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. The food was excellent - we had brunch, room service dinner and breakfast and all three were wonderful.The staff just was a little off - a few examples. The elevators stopped working for a period of time late in the afternoon, and there was a lot of confusion for much longer than there should have been. It took a good 20 minutes for them to get an employee out by the elevator banks to redirect, explain, etc. Once they got a handle on it, they routed us through the service elevators (long lines) and offered complimentary bottles of water, but it was pandemonium until that point, and a lot of people needed to get ready to go out for the evening so it was particularly poorly timed. I don't fault the hotel for the elevators breaking - but how they managed it could have used improvement.There were other odds and ends that were just sloppy - we requested extra pillows, and realized 4 hours later that those pillows had never been delivered. We ordered room service, and no steak knife arrived with the steak, and they missed a drink order.My husband finally called the manager because we were irritated and the manager was actually a bit condescending, and could have handled it better. They did give us a $100 credit, but it wasn't really about the money as much as an acknowledgement."
5,Fantastic hotel!,"The hotel was wonderful-- just flawless service and nothing was amiss. The employees were friendly and professional from when we arrived to a greeting and a door opened to checkout and storing bags. The only thing I would like is regular drip coffee set-up in the lobby for hotel guests... waiting in the coffee shop with the attached convention center was painful, especially if you just wanted regular coffee."
5,Amazing Austin,"This is a top notch hotel! Their friendly staff helped me to have the best stay I have had in months. Not only is it beautiful, comfortable and clean, it is also decently priced. I spent 6 days in Austin, 3 for business and 3 for pleasure and each time I came into this hotel, it felt like home."
5,Lovely!,"The property is beautiful and provides great location to whatever you need. We had quick access by walking, Lyft, or scooter within minutes.Enjoyed the food at the pool, Garrisons, Revue, and room service. Surprisingly enough, good options to choose from and food was good!Austin is great, you won't be disappointed."
5,Incredible Spa!,"Words cannot express how phenomenal my spa experience was at the Fairmont Austin! The moment I walked in I felt relaxed. The coordinators were very friendly and welcoming, and made sure my experience was perfect. The spa amenities are extremely impressive. The jacuzzi overlooking the skyline is a nice way to relax before and after a service. I highly recommend the fairmont signature massage. Shana Lee was absolutely incredible! She was professional, super friendly and truly delivered a masterful experience. Thank you so much Shana you‚Äôre the best!!!If you want a true luxury experience, visit the Fairmont Austin Spa!"
5,Loved the Fairmont Austin,"The Fairmont Austin is truly a luxury hotel for those who need to decompress in a beautiful environment. I loved my view of the gorgeous pool and loved, loved, loved the gym. I've never seen such a variety of machines, nice space for exercising, and the fresh fruit, water, towels and ear buds were a lovely perk."
3,Not all but some,Not all but some of the front desk staff made it seem as if they couldn‚Äôt be bothered with the guests. When I checked in the gentleman who helped was pretty rude and didn‚Äôt seem like he wanted to be at work. It could have been a better experience for my first time staying at the Fairmont.
5,ALTA,"My first trip staying at the Fairmont in Austin, and it was everything I expected of a Fairmont. The Texas charm was present at every aspect of my stay. The first night on the 32nd floor facing South with incredible views of the lake. A few nights later we‚Äôre back, and on the 27th floor. This time facing Northwest and the illuminated Texas State Capital. The Austin Fairmont is perfect!"
5,Great Experience,"The Fairmont reflects luxury comfort. Well appointed room. Room Service, perfect.Location is central to most activities to see and do in the area. . Staff is knowledgeable. The shuttle service with Adam, Chase and Duncan as drivers is so pleasant. That service is great to get you to a little farther away than a walk. Overall, our stay has been absolutely fabulous. Thank you."
5,"Very warm hospitality, great stay","Great service at the Fairmont Austin. Julie at reception deserves a special mention for friendly and efficient service.My room was very clean, quiet and comfortable. A great stay overall. Would definitely recommend it"
5,Customer service you deserve,"Whether it is for business or pleasure, this new hotel is the place to stay. Centrally located with knowledgeable staff. From when they open the door for you to the time you retire you‚Äôre surrounded by friendly and accommodating staff everywhere in the hotel."
5,Fabulous,"A beautiful, well maintained hotel, with a very acommodating staff. The restaurant has an unusual men and the food was exceptional. The lobby bar also had good drinks and good service. I would recomend a stay at this property ."
4,Beautiful New Hotel,"The Fairmont is a spacious, bright and airy addition to Downtown Austin.All of the employees are friendly and welcoming, the decor is well done and vibrant, the rooms are comfortable with huge windows and good amenities.What's a little strange is that some of the brightly painted walls and doors are already showing signs of wear and tear where they've been hit by luggage carts.The main bar is open plan and again feels spacious although when there's a convention it is jam packed. There's an enclosed walkway to the convention center.There is a food hall-type dining area that provides for a wide variety of food and drinks.If you feel the need to venture out, Rainey St. is just across Cesar Chavez!"
5,Fairmont October 2019,"The hotel clean and the staff was friendly. The downtown location was very convenient to the convention center that i went to each day on my business trip. I would recommend putting a fridge in each room,"
5,Wonderful stay,"Fairmont knows how to do it right and make it an experience to remember. From the rooms, to the amenities, to the pool area to the numerous areas to talk or relax. And the staff are awesome. Every single interaction from check in, to concierge to bell hop to wait staff to security (lost our phone) was exemplary. Well done fairmont."
5,An EXCELLENT Rooftop Pool,"We booked a stay-cation at the Fairmont in Austin, and loved our night here. One of our favorite parts was the rooftop pool. Excellent drinks and a great view of Austin. In the evening, we enjoyed the hot tub on the roof. Very relaxing. One of our favorite parts of the day was the buffet breakfast in the restaurant. This was possibly one of the best buffets I've ever had. They had everything--including a make-your-own crepe stand! Top notch hotel!"
5,Great stay!,"Love this hotel! Quick and efficient service with a smile! From the moment we walked to the front desk to check in, till the day we checked out, the service was exceptional. Will definitely come back next time we are in Austin."
5,Beautiful hotel,"Location was perfect for Convention Center. Good food, bar & music. All amenities. Nice workout/ spa area. My only complaint would be that the mini fridge was so full there is no room for personal items."
5,One of the best cities Austin,"From the moment we arrived till check out i would give the hotel 5 stars. The first night we arrived around 7;30 pm and walked over to Rainey Street we were surprised how close it was to the hotel a 5 minute walk. The buffet the next morning was fantastic . The pool at the hotel after our U of Texas tour was thriving and had great energy. The spa and steam were top notch. The next evening we ventured to Dirty 6th street and it was such a nice night out we walked home to the hotel my sons used the bird/ lime scooters and ventured out on there own. All in all great location , lots of action at the hotel , great service and concierge would highly recommend this hotel"
5,Total Wow!,The Fairmont Austin is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in! Just a huge wow from the minute you enter the hotel. The restaurants/bars are all very nicely done and the food is wonderful. The Spa and fitness facilities are first rate. Meeting space well appointed. Wonderful outdoor space at the pool and 7th floor bar. Highly recommend!
5,Business Stay Convention,Staff was very polite and helpful. Very prompt on any request I had for room or services I needed.Great location and great bathroom!!! Room Cleaning crew were awesome!!!I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone that ask me where the should stay when visiting downtown Austin!
5,Great Weekend,Attended a business function at the Fairmont Austin and stayed for the weekend to attend the Austin City Limits Music Festival. This hotel is wonderful and very relaxing. We enjoyed the on-site spa as well and were very much impressed with the facilities. Only complaint is that as a result of a large amount of music festival clientele there was an instance where somebody vomited by the elevator on our floor and it wasn't cleaned up for about 12 hours. Thankfully somebody at least covered with napkins until housekeeping could attend to it.
5,Amazing customer service and food,"I did not stay in a room but met up with a friend staying there for our conference. The staff there were very friendly and helpful, the lobby and public areas are beautiful, and the food was wonderful. Our server Miescha was super friendly, helpful and patient, managing our food preferences and sensitivities with kindness and respect. Would definitely recommended and want to give a HUGE thanks to Miescha!"
3,Expected much more,"When I booked this hotel, based on previous reviews, I was expecting everything to be excellent. Some things were, somethings were not. We only stayed for one night and were planning to enjoy it as much as we could. Check-in: Very slow. We had to wait because one desk was busy and two other employees were taking to each other. Spa: the spa is amazing, this is one of the strongest points. We did not have any service done but just paid for the day pass and relaxed a couple of hours. The spa staff was super nice. Room service: we ordered some very basic things and they were mostly a fail. I ordered ceasar salad with chicken and the chicken was undercooked. The guacamole was meh. Wings were OK. The prices were too high for what it was. Checkout: NIGHTMARE. I tried calling before I left to make sure the accounted for what we took from the mini bar. (We had selected express checkout the nigh before so supposedly they just email you the bill) NO ONE ANSWERED. We had to leave and of course I receive the email with the bill and it is ALL WRONG (I am calling later today to verify). They added charges of things we did not even tough. Anyway, that can be fixed I guess, I will call today. PARKING: $36 / night as a guest. WOW. like the price of the room is not enough to guarantee safe, free parking? Pretty disappointed with the experience overall, it could have been super pleasant but the CONS mentioned in this review had me worrying during and after the stay instead of just enjoying it."
4,"Comfortable and new, great pool","We stayed at the fairmont for a weekend getaway. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. The pool is great, only complaint is that it was very busy the weekend we stayed and there weren't enough chairs at the pool and service was slow. Overall I would recommend this hotel."
5,ALTA One,"Mixed visit, vacation with conference for spouse's work. Amazing hotel with good rates, fine dining and great bars for adult beverages. Entertainment in the 6th Street District is walking distance, about four blocks and Rainey Street to the South is three blocks.The Revue Bar at the Fairmont features upscale drinks and entertaining mixologists, like Kyle, below on the left. Live entertainment in the main bar nightly is smooth and welcome background."
5,Wonderful stay excellent service by staff during breakfast,"The staff was absolutely amazing. Our room was clean and spacious.The only thing that could have been improved was the bf Buffett‚Äôs food could have been hotter. Very nice selection of food but some ie eggs, oatmeal and meats were luck warm."
4,Friendly staff,"Clean, spacious rooms with natural light. The staff were super courteous and friendly. Only issue was that the door in between the adjoining room I was staying at was not adequately sound-proofed. My neighbor was watching tv or had it turned on very late at night and early in the morning. The management should try to solve this problem realizing that once in a while they will have people who would not consider others around them and would watch with full volume."
5,Can't wait to return!,"Lovely hotel; spacious, beautiful, great staff. For people like us (in their 50's plus), I would highly recommend spending you at this Fairmont - as the location is central to action - but not in the middle of crazy. We were on the 15th floor and and could hear a little noise from Rainey Street fun - only a bit on Saturday night. We stayed 4 nights and I look forward to a return visit - a wonderful place to visit Austin and the Fairmont helped make that happen."
5,Ourtrageously Cool Austin Experience,"Honestly, it's rare that I'll take time to write a review for a hotel. But, The Fairmont Hotel in Austin gave me the greatest Austin experience, that I have no choice BUT to write one! The hotel itself is situated in a perfect spot in the city. Right next to the river and steps from all the action of Congress Avenue. The vibe is totally cool and fun, also. Great mix of hipsters, jocks, and business types. Lots of eye-candy. Pool and restaurants were a blast. BUT, the real kicker was the Southern hospitality from the employees....especially one concierge who deserves calling out. Robert was not only personable, very knowledgeable and helpful...but incredibly friendly and professional, as well. Gave us great tips for lots to do in this fun town. He is PERFECT as a concierge and would definitely be someone I'd call for a beer any day of the week. Thank you Robert M!!! I'll definitely be back and will now plan to stay at other Fairmont properties because of this great experience. Much appreciated."
5,Perfect!,Carlos was amazing! He made sure to double check with the chefs about a food allergy and had the best recommendations and speed of service! Thank you for making this experience so special at the Fairmont!
5,Revue,Carlos provided the best service and food recommendations at this restaurant. The drinks were fenomenal on their own and the food was high quality with great flavor. The atmosphere was fun and innovative. Highly recommend.
5,Great wedding block experience,"We had our wedding in Austin and reserved a block at the Fairmont. It was the perfect place -- very central, brand new hotel, great service, and the pool is amazing. It was easy to set up the block, and the events staff went out of their way to help us. We recommend it!"
5,Went for a conference ....stayed for the Spa,"Went with my husband to his conference, since I was solo lost of the day i was able to check out the services the hotel had to offer. Got a facial and mani/pedi at the Spa. They were wonderful but very expensive. Cost was pretty similar to other swanky hotel spas. Staff was very nice and helpful. Rooms were spacious and beds were very comfortable. Would def stay here again. Valet was very efficient and courteous."
5,New Clean Stylish Property with Attentive Service,"This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of downtown Austin near Rainier Street and within walking distance to 6th Street. Upon arrival I was greeted by a friendly smiling agent at the front desk for check-in who was thorough in outlining the hotel amenities. He noticed I was carrying a pack of beverages and promptly arranged to have a separate mini-fridge delivered to my room. I received a text upon checking into my room to see how everything was, and was once again asked for feedback when I initially logged on to the Internet. There I commented that it would be nice to have a couple of small bottles of water for the in-room Nespresso machine, which was delivered with a thank you card to my room the next day. The room was spacious, stylish, and nicely appointed. I was sent an Express Checkout email link which expired before my checkout, as the line was quite long at departure I just called the hotel to email me a copy of the folio after.My company also held a meeting at the property so in terms of the Conference Facilities the Wi-Fi Internet service was spotty, they were too quick to remove the coffee in between our all-day sessions and the snacks always run out. While the catering was good in general they seem to enjoy serving what appears to be leftovers from dinner the night before for lunch the next day.Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend this property for those travelling to Austin!"
3,12 Slow Elevators + Even slower food servcie,"This hotel has two adjacent banks of 6 elevators and I waited at least 4 minutes every time I pushed the button. The line in the coffee bar in the morning was out the door. The service in the restaurant was... weird. I asked for a table and they said only high tops / bar was available. I pointed at a row of empty tables and was told ""they are all wobbly right now, you can't sit there."" Food service was slow for breakfast and my egg tacos arrived cold. Do better, Fairmont!"
5,OUTSTANDING Experience,"They do things right , luxury accommodations, world class service , fantastic location and great facilities . We were impressed that the breakfast buffet and the parking was included in the price. The staff made sure every interaction was perfect. Thank-you."
5,How cozy room it is,I had a conference in the convention center during this trip.Fairmont Austin is connected to the convention center by the corridor. It is very convenient and safe.And my room is well organized every day. I stayed there so comfortably.
5,No Weak Spot,"Excellent service, room with a spectacular view of downtown Austin, floor to ceiling windows for panoramic view. Every detail carefully thought to make your experience very enjoyable. For instance, the hot tub at the spa was run with salt water, instead of chemicals, i.e. chlorine. The decor was modern with warm colors, pleasant to the eye, and the lobby had plenty of spots to work with a view, live music and food"
5,Anniversary getaway,Perfect stat for a quick getaway! Lots of sights and sounds to take in with the beauty of the hotel and the great service! It‚Äôs like stepping into a movie scene. Would come back to enjoy the great pool scene!
5,ACL trip,Great stay and not far from ACL shuttle. Hotel is beautiful and smells great. The breakfast was a little weak but otherwise pretty good. Parking was good and drinks at the bar were well done. Will stay again
5,Great weekend!,We were in town for 1 night and wanted to be close to as much as possible. The Fairmont is top class! They held our luggage both days and didn‚Äôt charge extra. Within walking distance to lots of the best local attractions.
5,An excellent hotel!,"This is a very grand and nice hotel. The hotel has very good facilities - a number of restaurants and bars, gym, a pool on the 7th floor, banquet halls....it really feels very grand and opulent.The check in was very smooth. The staff are very friendly and courteous. The rooms a very nice indeed- large and spacious, nice bed and very good working area.The fast checkout was just amazing!Breakfast could be better.Overall an excellent hotel"
5,Awesome Austin Fairmont,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel for our anniversary. We made our resy through ""Jaz"", and she had a bottle of wine and chocolate strawberries waiting for us in our room. Our check-in was fast, friendly, and helpful. The front desk personnel were all great. We had dinner plans around the city, but we did have cocktails at the bar in the restaurant area. Great bartenders and great cocktails! The room was fabulous! Very clean and shiny. Comfortable bed and pillows. Rainey Street is a short walk; maybe 3 blocks. Rainey St. is made up of old homes converted into cool, casual bars lined up and down the street. Great food trucks everywhere! Great restaurants within $5-$7 Uber fares. Special thanks to William Hansel in the beautiful Spa! Highly recommend this Hotel! I know parking garages are expensive to build, but $50 for Valet; $38 for self parking (?!); for Austin; is quite high. If you're flying in; you're golden. Other than that; 5 star!!"
5,Fairmont Hotel Austin,"The Austin Fairmont Hotel was a wonderful experience. It was well located. We enjoyed the gold experience in which we were able to check in at our own desk, on our own floor and check out as well when it was time to leave and no one else was ahead of us. The concierge level was amazing for breakfast and happy hour, as well as snacks and beverages throughout the day. We also dined in one of the restaurants the first evening and had brunch the last morning of our stay on the seventh floor. The whole Fairmont experience could not have been better and we plan to return whenever we return to Austin in the future."
5,Clean and Posh,The stay was absolutely amazing. The check-in process went smoothly and everyone was very friendly. We ate at the Revue restaurant and it was quite enjoyable with a variety of options!My favorite part of the hotel room was the slow closing feature on the bathroom barn door!
5,Great Stay,"A great stay at a great hotel in a great city (Austin). Kudos! I have no complaints and very little room for improvement - staff is attentive and friendly, accommodations are great, color scheme is on-brand and views are great. The only suggestion would be to reconsider the frosted glass at the end of each hallway in the common area of the floors - makes it look like it is raining out regardless of weather. Also, rain-shower heads would be great in the bathrooms - the little things that move it up to Ritz-Four Seasons."
5,Great stay in Austin,"Clean, friendly, excellent restaurant and beautiful! Well place in downtown Austin within walking distance to many great bars and restaurants. Also very close to the capitol and the tour there as excellent!"
5,GAME DAY,The Fairmont Austin has become my hotel of choice when I visit the city. I often come here for football games and the location is excellent. I have been a member of the Fairmont presidential club for sometime and I would say this Fairmont may be the best in the country.
4,Recent Visit,Hotel was nice clean very nice. Only bad thing that made me drop rating was walked 3 miles to rent a bike spent $40 and then saw other guests getting a complimentary bike. I was unaware that was available I spent $40 and wasted 3 miles of walking when could have got one for no charge. Would have been nice if there was mention of that posted somewhere. Otherwise really nice hotel and staff.
5,Trip to Austin,"Beautiful Hotel Centrally located, Very convenient, Extremely Professional and Courteous Staff. Excellent Amenities, Extremely Clean and Well Run Property. The Event Staff and Food Service was Exceptional as Well."
5,La Tech game versus Texas,Excellent hotel downtown with walking access to most every restaurant and features of downtown Austin. Excellent staff and very nice rooms. Great amenities at the hotel and bar area. Relaxation and great atmosphere.
5,Long Weekend Getaway,The Fairmont was a great hotel to stay to celebrate my 60th birthday. The live entertainment in the lower level bar was great. The pool on the 7th floor is awesome as well. It helped make a really hot day much more tolerable.
5,The spa is fantastic.,"Overall the entire building was well staffed and clean. The spa, however, had the absolute perfect staff for the experience and the eucalyptus steam room was dialed. One of the crew, William Hensel, was anticipatory and inherently kind. There is a very nominal charge for a day pass that had us expecting a subpar spa, which is the complete opposite of what the Fairmont Austin has put together. Completely splendid, will absolutely return."
5,A weekend of adventure and relaxation - thank you Robert Concierge,"I came to Austin for a special weekend with my wife. Upon arrival to the Fairmont, I went to see the concierge for ideas and that was the best decision.Robert Concierge was amazing! He listened to my story and excitement to have a getaway weekend with my lovely wife. He gave us fantastic suggestions for restaurants, music places and activities. He is knowledgeable, friendly and focused on details to make you feel very special. The weekend ended with a special note from Robert Concierge and champagne to celebrate. Next time I visit Austin no doubt I will stay at the Fairmont hotel.Thank you Robert Concierge for your outstanding customer service and helping me to have a very special weekend in Austin."
5,"Our ""Dining Experience Specialist"" Alif Hornsby was amazing!!!","Alif showed great knowledge of wines, care and consideration of our experience, great personality that was engaging and fun throughout the night. Alif and the staff at Fairmont Austin was so attentive to our needs and even provided us with a bottle of wine to take home because of a slight mention of how much we enjoyed our glasses of the Palazzao Della Torre. We will definitely come back for the amazing service from Alif and the staff, as well as the truly delicious cuisines from all over the world. Best restaurant in the Fairmont and quite possibly the best in Austin."
5,Great Stay at The Fairmount Austin,I was here for a business conference and found the hotel to be really a pleasure to stay in - great location only a few blocks from the nightlife on Rainey Street and great walking/running/biking paths along the water. Enjoyed it thoroughly and would definitely stay again
5,Great weekend getaway!,"For my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday we decided to spend the weekend as gold members at Fairmont Austin. It was an incredible experience. The front desk staff, the room, the pool, and the food was all some of the best that we have encountered. Special thanks to Harun Ozdemir for the extra attention he made sure to make our stay and her birthday very special.Robert Jay Connelly."
5,Amazing service,"We had the most fabulous service courtesy of Alif Hornesby in the Revue dining center. Alif was personable and intuitive. He offered thoughtful suggestions with a friendly and professional disposition. The food was amazing, and his extraordinary service level was memorable! Highly recommend!"
5,Amazing experience...excited for @ ALTA ONE,OMG the BEST hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had. So excited to come back to the Fairmont Austin for ALTA ONE later this month!Was lucky to stay one night in September. Never had a better hotel stay. From arrival to departure every single interaction with their hospitality staff was delightful. Easy check in. Super helpful bell services. Jaka the concierge offered 3 excellent tips for some curveball questions.The lobby is a museum. Incredible artwork. Go down early in the morning for a quiet pre-dawn art walk through the lobby. Such a special experience. The design ideas and details are spectacular. Such a cool place to experience.The pool?!? The pool is AMAZING. Alan‚Äôs team...Bjanka & Nebojsa were terrific and took care of every need for the rooftop pool crowd. Get the drinks that come in the bag from Rules & Regs. You‚Äôll be the coolest dood at the pool. Loved it!Before my flight I was lucky to have time to use the spa showers. William Hensel‚Äôs team is fabulous. Makes you feel like royalty. Special thanks to coordinator Naivi and attendant Andres for getting me in and out swiftly. They made my trip!!So excited to be back in October.
5,Excellent,Stellar customer service!!! Everyone very accommodating and friendly. Great space in the public areas and the size of individual rooms. Nice room lighting with wide windows.Will return again sometime.
5,King Size Room,The hotel was new and the staff was very helpful. The rooms were clean and very quiet. The location within the city was great. The pool area was awesome. The bars and restaurants served great food and drinks and the in room dining was quick good.
5,Great - we will be back,Finally getting round to writing this after an awesome weekend in Austin for ACL 2019. We stayed on the Gold Level of the hotel which had a separate check in and lounge access. Dialy checked us in and looked after us really well during our stay. The hotel itself is great with excellent amenities and a great location. I am reliably informed it is where anyone who is anyone stays when they are in Austin. I even saw 50 cent in the elevator on the way to get breakfast!
5,WGU Graduation Receptions,"Loving the ambiance, the service and friendliness of staff. The receptions were beautiful and elegant. Would stay at a Fairmont in the Future. Everywhwere was clean and staff was helpful. They really go out of their way to treat you top notch."
5,ENA Stay,"Loved everything! 7th floor Bar is the absolute BEST!!! Food was amazing. easy access to the convention center. The views were incredible . Close to 6 street. Comfortable bed, super clean . Everyone was soooo nice."
5,Luxury Stay,"I was impressed with the hotel. The bed was super comfy, the facility is luxurious and the location is awesome. I didn‚Äôt expect it to have a connecting bridge to the convention center( which was awesome!). The culinary experience was also top notch. I would stay here over and over again. Now I‚Äôll only look for Fairmont GOLD e experience."
5,Girls Trip,The hotel was just amazing! Beautiful facilities and staff that wanted to meet your every need. The beds and sheets were very comfortable and the Gold Club was AWESOME!!! Bicycles are available as well as a free shuttle to anything within a mile. Everyone was so helpful with both service and recommendations. Very close to great restaurants and other touristy sites. Make sure to eat at Red Ash restaurant.
5,"2019 ENA Conference, Austin, TX","Staying at the Fairmont Austin was fabulous! The hotel is beautiful and clean, with trendy d√©cor and warm, welcoming, friendly people to assist. My husband signed up to be a Gold member and the perks of the 35th floor were so great: the view, the food, the numerous sitting areas and again, the people! Our room was so nice. We had 2 amazingly comfortable queen beds. It was hard to leave the bed in the mornings. My husband took advantage of the gym and pool (stunning!). There is a connecting bridge to the conference center which was a pleasant surprise. The location is convenient to several restaurants and bars. We walked to the Congressional bridge to view the bats. They didn't swarm out into the sky the way we wanted, just swarmed under the bridge but cool to see that and all the people lined up on the bridge and on the bank of the river. We highly recommend staying at the Fairmont Austin!"
5,Wanna Relax in Austin- Fairmont,"Beautiful hotel right in the heart of Austin. It‚Äôs the perfect place to stay when you have a conference at the Convention Center (they are connected) or for a staycation in Austin. It is walking distance to great food places and the bars are great at the Fairmont. I went here for the official drink of Austin and had a blast. You should check the place out and spend a few nights here, you‚Äôll see thank me later."
5,Fairmont Austin,AC too loud. Affected our sleep. Centrally located. Beautiful pool. Close to all the activities. Walking distance to amazing restaurants. Great breakfast buffet. There were lot of people for the music festival. Busier than the usual. Would stay at Fairmont again.
4,ACL Fest Weekend,"The hotel was beautiful and the room was spacious and well-stocked. I was disappointed that wifi in room was not free and a friend staying with me had to pay for internet use in the business center. However, it was a great location downtown, A few minutes walk from Rainey St and the food trucks. Also walkable or cheap uber/lyft to 6th street."
5,Best Service Period,The Fairmont has a nice texting feature where you can text the front desk and they can help with whatever you need.From even before I arrived they were attentive and helpful. I had a hard time finding some bags for a Cornhole game and Victor Fioreze went above and beyond to get them for us. I hands down with always stay at a Fairmont if possible especially with staff like Victor setting the bar.
5,Fairmont in Austin Texas is amazing!!,"This hotel was fantastic!! It is in a great location with an amazing view of downtown. A short walk to 6th Street for some great live entertainment and music. I highly recommend walking going over to ""The Container Bar"" Also, the Cafe 605 was a great place up the road from the Fairmont. If you stay in, the restaurants inside the Fairmont are amazing!! Garrison has great food and the guacamole dip at Rules & Regs bar on the 7h floor is outstanding. Do yourself a favor, if you're going to Austin, STAY AT THE FAIRMONT IN AUSTIN!! You won't regret"
5,Amazing Amazing Amazing!!!!,"Not only was the hotel itself gorgeous, but the service was amazing. Upon arrival, I was greeted with the kindest service I've ever recieved from the concierge Monica on the 35th floor. She not only helped me find things to do but helped me my entire stay with the little things I needed for my stay. Then from room to restaurant, the Garrison downstairs offered phenomenal service with the bartender of the evening, Rick who was very kind and created great conversation while he helped me choose the wine I needed for a relaxing night. I was 100% impressed by this hotel and restaurant and would gladly recommend both to anyone visiting Austin. The staff as a whole, from housekeeping to the greeters at the front entrance, made my stay easy, relaxing, stress-free and fun. Thank you guys!"
5,An excellent Fairmont,"This is a beautiful Fairmont Hotel and I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Austin, Texas. If you can, upgrade to the Faimont gold experience. Fantastic views and it is in an excellent location. Across the street from Rainey Street and walkable to downtown and the State Capital building."
5,"Delightful Service, Fantastically Comfy Rooms and Beds",I love staying at the Fairmont when in Austin. It's in a great location. The staff is super friendly. I love taking advantage of their new luxury spa. The room views aren't bad and the Gold Club is SO worth the upgrade.
4,Business Trip to Austin,"Generally a very good trip at this relatively new and well lit hotel. The rooms are spacious and of high quality and the general facilities including restaurants, gift shop and lobby were excellent. When not overwhelmed service was very good and people were receptive. Hotel is a bit gaudy and looks like a Casino Hotel with air conditions running way too strong. Nice Hotel for a short stay."
5,Beautiful Hotel,Fairmont Austin is a beautiful hotel within blocks of great shopping and eateries. Staff is super friendly and the skyline view pool was a bonus. I would gladly stay at this hotel on any trip to Austin.
5,Great stay,Good position in Downtown Austin. Rooms large and clean. Great pool. Good selection of restaurants.The staff were helpful and professional. Nespresso machines available in the rooms. Excellent coffee served in the coffee bar in the mornings.
5,Excellent hotel,"I stayed six nights for a business meeting and I absolutely loved the Fairmont Austin. The rooms were bright and clean, although my view on the 8th floor was only of a rooftop. The bathrooms were well done, but clearly no women were involved in planning the layout. Why in the world are the trash cans in a cabinet, far from the toilet? It's just terrible if you happen to be a woman who might have her period while traveling. TMI? Maybe, but it's dreadfully inconvenient. The rooms were nicely sound-proofed though. I was leaving just as large groups of teen girls were arriving for the ACL festival and I had no trouble with noise.The hotel staff have been trained very well and are very eager to provide a quality stay for all of their guests. The food in the venues and for room service is excellent. The pool looked incredible and I wish I had added on to my trip so I could have enjoyed it.The location is great, too. Connected to the convention center, walking distance to tons of restaurants, central to everything."
5,"Great place, great location!","Rod, they day bartender at Rules n Regs was the best. Great service, but more importantly, a great person with a wonderful attitude & suggestions about the hotel/city. Really enjoyed speaking with him."
5,World Class Hotel,"I stayed at Fairmont Austin in fall 2019 for a conference. It is a gorgeous property in a great location downtown Austin. The staff is super-helpful. When I realized I had forgotten to bring something, I went to the front desk and they provided it for me at no charge. The lobby bar has nightly musical entertainment and a great atmosphere. I would stay here again."
5,Wonderful Hotel,"Everyone was friendly and really seemed to enjoy their jobs! From the front desk staff, bartenders, and cleaning staff it was a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend this hotel. Just around the corner to some fantastic Austin life!"
4,"Nice newer hotel, Easy drive from the airport, But.....","Clean , newer hotel , full featured. But if you want to get some sleep before 11:00, forget about it! The outside bar area has a live music playing very loud. I was on the 26th floor , can't imagine what the lower floors sounded like."
5,Great Staff and Great Property,"My wife and I have stayed at the Fairmont Austin 6 times for both business and pleasure and have been impressed by the staff each time. Most recently, we attended a conference and the quality of the food was very good."
5,Great hotel and staff,The hotel felt new without any cheap shortcuts and the staff was always very nice and helpful. We stayed for 3 days for a conference. The food was always above the average hotel type of food. I will likely return some day.
1,No one cared,Was terrible. No one cared about me. No one knew who I was. Forgotten drink orders all of the time by pool. Staff is not trained up enough nor realize the hotel that they work for. This is Fairmont - Act like it. I was told no so many times. One person even told me they don't have seltzer water.
5,"Amazing property, even better staffs","This is an amazingly beautiful property done with modern design and lots beautiful marble, granite, stones everywhere. There is a little bit of history element in the decor mixed in with the modern concept. Hands down the best pool EVER!!I only had one day to explore Austin, way too short but with the help of Robert(awesome concierge staff) I was able to sample a good variety of what Austin has to offer; from the bats u see the bridge, live music, to dinner recommendations. Thank you, Rob!Now, off to plan my return to this awesome hotel and next time, I will be staying for much longer!"
5,Fairmont Austin is one of the best,"The room itself was amazing, the view I got from the helpful person at the front desk (he gave me a corner room) was just amazing. All of the staff that I ran in to was incredibly helpful and I would use the Fairmont again."
5,Awesome stay,Had a quick business trip to Austin and stayed at a Fairmont property for the first time. The hotel exceeded my expectations. The hotel was gorgeous and the service was excellent. I walked away a fan!
5,A fabulous location and property...,"We were so pleased with the Fairmont Austin. A beautiful property. Service was top notch and we loved the location. Appreciated being away from the hustle and bustle of 6th street and liked the proximity to Rainey street. All in all, highly recommend!!!"
5,Outstanding!,"The Fairmont Austin is one of the newest and nicest hotels in the Austin CBD and is near contiguous with the Austin Convention Center. The hotel has great, personable service and amenities. The bedding and linens were perfect. The hotel does have the required fire detection, exit markings and fire suppression equipment.There are a number of restaurants in the hotel and a great cocktail lounge on the 7th floor with a dramatic view of Austin. Cocktails were reasonable for the downtown location.I did have a billing issue after my departure but it was quickly resolved by a reservations specialist.As advertised, valet parking is $49, per night + tax. I would suggest using a taxi or Uber getting around downtown.Austin does have a very visible homeless problem with accompanying street crime. The Governor of Texas has given Austin City until November 1, 2019 to take action to clean up homelessness"
5,Perfect option for wedding hotel block!,"I used the Fairmont for my Wedding Block hotel and could not have had a better experience! The staff was quick to respond to my emails leading up to the event and truly went above and beyond to accommodate our group.The booking process for our block was very straightforward and easy for our guests to use. We ended up getting an extremely competitive rate for our group (many people told me they shopped around for other hotel prices and the Fairmont's was the best they found!) Even after filling up our block, the Fairmont was kind enough to work with us to add a few extra rooms for our remaining guests.I was initially nervous about using the Fairmont for our wedding block since we had not personally stayed there before, but it ended up exceeding even my highest of expectations! The staff went out of their way to make sure our parents and our rooms were just what we wanted -- even upgrading us to a suite upon check in! There were so many sweet touches added to our stay. From welcome drinks and snacks in our room the first night, to a surprise delivery of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries on our wedding night, the Fairmont continuously went out of their way to make us feel special!Our guests LOVED staying at the hotel for it's extremely comfortable rooms and great amenities. Many of our guests spent the afternoons lounging by the amazing Fairmont pool and we always had a large group at night hanging at the Fairmont's great bars! There was nothing more I could have asked for from the hotel!The value for money cannot be beat in the Austin area! If you are looking for a hotel for your wedding block, or just looking for a place to stay, the Fairmont Austin is the best around!"
5,best hotel in AUSTIN,from start to finish the staff cannot do enough for you. the room is well appointed and very clean. the pool area and the food venues are fabulous. the location is great and easy walking distance to downtown Austin .
5,Perfect hotel!,Great location for conference needs at nearby convention center. Gold Floor has wonderful space and service...Jewel is excellent and listed activities in Austin for us. She is wonderful! Roger at the front desk was also amazing ! Cassie at Revue was sweet and had great food! Best hotel gym by far. Thank you Fairmont Austin. :)
5,Impeccable,A beautiful hotel with great service and amenities! I would highly recommend and will definitely stay again! Pool area is a must and I felt drink prices were very reasonable for the location. Plenty to keep you busy in and around the hotel.
5,Stellar Hotel,AC unit was acting weird and screwed with our sleep. But everything else was top notch. Especially the pool area. This hotel is in a hot spot of DT as well so easy to get around to the night spots and great restaurants.
5,Great!,Great hotel! A bit on the expensive side but the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The restaurant and bar and excellent. The Sunday brunch was incredible. I would stay there again when I return to Austin.
5,THANK YOU FAIRMONT AND STAFF!!!!,Our entire stay at Fairmont was an amazing experience. Fairmont exceeded our expectations. Little thing as giving us a higher level room due to it being our anniversary to sending a happy anniversary dessert to our room. We will definitely make Fairmont our home when staying in Austin. Sixth street was two blocks away. Couldn‚Äôt have gotten any better. The pool was amazing; great environment.
5,Great Place to Stay,"The customer service at the Fairmont Austin is first class! We were there for a work conference and our flight arrived mid morning and the Fairmont was very accommodating in letting us check in early. Rooms were very nice and comfortable. The room was very clean. The bed was oh so comfortable but the pillows were too soft but I know that's a personal preference. There is no refrigerator or microwave in the rooms so we weren't able to bring any doggy bags home from the restaurants but overall the Fairmont is a very, very nice place to stay."
5,Great hotel,"The hotel itself was extremely comfortable and we loved the gold lounge food and service. They did an excellent job. Service at the pool could be better for beverages. We did not have service there but the pool was excellent. Room, pillows and bed was the best!"
5,Fabulous Fairmont!,"Amazing in every way. Most friendly, helpful staff, beautiful room. Lobby with live music every night was a perfect bonus. Location is perfect. Able to walk everywhere. I would stay again, and never look anywhere else."
5,Fairmont Austin Review,This is an excellent facility with modern accommodations and an attentive staff. The cafe and restaurante offerings were diverse and allowed for a wide selection of plates and beverages. The spa facilities were superb.
5,Excellent Hotel,"Beautiful and clean hotel. The facility was very classy, clean, and up-to-date. They have a magnifying mirror in the room as well as a Nespresso machine. Such an amazing place. The beds were very comfortable as well. I loved the layout of the rooms."
4,"Gorgeous hotel, but be prepared for a party crowd!","This hotel is stunning. The pool--one of its main attractions-- was way too crowded. And, while in theory ""family friendly,"" we were there with the old (grandparents) and babies. We did not find it to very ""family comfortable."" No shade at the pool . For the price tag, there should have been more.Also, be prepared for loads of bachelor/-ette type crowds. If you are looking for a party scene, this is a good choice; if with family, there are probably better options.I would still return. It is gorgeous!"
5,great hotel,Top notch service and great rooms make this a no brainer! Great pool ideal for kidsI would encourage management to have a focus on families with kids like other properties do esp given the demographics
5,Amazing weekend!,"Just spent the past three nights at the beautiful Fairmont Austin. My wife and I were lucky to stay in one of the Fairmont Gold rooms and had an amazing experience with the entire staff there.A few names I must mention are Sebastian, Brandon, Brandan, Jewell, Juan, Monica, Dave, Jose, and Mayank.Each and every staff member was extremely attentive, helpful, but most notably delivered authentic hospitality. We will return primarily because of the staff, location and brand were a bonus. Thank you all for such an amazing weekend."
5,Outstanding,"Great service, delicious food, nice room, beautiful lobby. Here for a conference and everything was handled well. Needed a larger ice bucket and a different blanket, which they delivered to the room. No complaints."
5,Excellent Property - one minor complaint,"Beautiful room, courteous and helpful staff, first-class accommodations, good location downtown. I have one minor complaint. The design of the very nice shower with the glass door resulted in a big puddle of water next to the shower every time I took a shower."
2,Missed the mark!,"This was a group business trip which had approximately 20 rooms paid by one account. Needless to say, we spent a lot of money here. Checkin went exceptionally well. After that, it all goes south! This is a beautiful property however it feels as though they don‚Äôt embrace their own customer service corporate culture.A word to the wise, do not accept an adjoining room! We were booked into a standard room and upgraded at checkin to a deluxe room. For that, I was very appreciative.After we checked-in, I decided to order room service. I ordered chicken that came with mashed potatoes. The chicken was hot however the potatoes were ice cold! I called room service to let them know and they offered new hot ones however I declined as I no longer wanted them. Even though I declined, nothing else was offered. If she had removed the room service delivery charge or SOMETHING, it would have been a nice jester...but nothing!Our room had an adjoining door and it wasn‚Äôt until the next morning I realized just how noisy this would be. First, it started with his alarm. When it went off I thought it was mine as we have the same alarm tone. I was privileged to hear 100% of his conversation with his wife since he was using his speakerphone. While he took his shower, I felt as if I was in his bathroom as I again heard it all!!! While he was showering, I believe I counted 9 text messages as they dinged upon arrival. I called downstairs to inquire about a new room and was told I would have to be inconvenienced if I wanted a new room. Ironically, when I told her she needed to get management involved; a room mysteriously became available and we did move later that day. I was appreciative of the managers efforts. The rooms are nice with large showers. The let down is the shower spray is more of a trickle than shower. Both rooms had the same low water volume coming from the shower head so it‚Äôs obviously a property issue.After we endured our neighbors‚Äô conversations and shower, we ordered breakfast. Well guess what...my oatmeal was not even close to being warm. This time when I called to report the problem, I did accept a replacement. However, I reported it to the manager that gave us the new room and also explained about last nights room service problem. While she did state she would order ‚Äúpiping hot oatmeal‚Äù again, nothing was offered for the inconvenience; especially since it was now twice in a row! Oh and by the way, they failed to provide her request of ‚Äúpiping hot‚Äù. I believe ‚Äújust barely warm‚Äù was a better way to describe the replacement oats. I gave up!!!We had a group dinner and the next morning the host of the dinner apologized to the group for ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù food and service. One of the menu items was fish that came out so dry and overcooked, it was barely edible. The short rib was ok but just...ok. It too was overcooked and dry. We asked if they would roll the portable bar into our dining room and they stated they couldn‚Äôt because it would, ‚Äúmake too much noise.‚Äù Yes, you read that right! Now, this was an open bar dinner and the servers, who lacked knowledge in attention to guests, guarded the bottles of wine as if it were the prohibition era and never provided additional drinks from the portable bar. Several times, guests had to get up and pour their own wine while the servers happily watched. If the servers did come by with wine is was because a dinner guest requested. They would quickly leave the table once that guests glass was poured without refilling others glass.I believe everyone in this hotel should take lessons from the downstairs bartenders. They exemplified a level of customer service I believe corporate wants. We went back to the bar on our second night and when they did not have the champagne my wife ordered, they poured Louis Roederer Cristal as a replacement but charged her for her original request!!! No THAT‚Äôs customer service!!! On our last night, we decided to go to the bar on the 7th floor. Once she took our order and learned we would be taking our drinks to the room, she quickly grabbed plastic cups. I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt drink quality scotch from a plastic cup! I asked why the downstairs bar allows the same glassware to go to the room yet this bar doesn‚Äôt and her response was as I expected, ‚ÄúUm...that‚Äôs a good question.‚Äù Needless to say, we left and went downstairs and got our drinks for the room.Overall, this is a great looking property but from the time the valet took the keys and waited for their tip in a VERY obvious manner, until checkout, we experienced too many inconsistencies to recommend this property. Did they take care of the room...yes. However, for what you pay at this property, you should not expect consistent poor service.I am a top tier member of Marriotts‚Äô program and even in their lower budget properties, I don‚Äôt experience these levels of inconsistencies. There is a reason I have placed my loyalty with Marriott. I‚Äôm sorry Fairmont Austin, I can‚Äôt recommend you as a place to stay."
5,Wonderful modern hotel,"A large Confrence hotel well located , good bars , quality gym with peloton bikes (2) .rooms spacious and comfortable beds , the club lounge is very good and worth upgrading to . Swimming pool busy and spacious"
5,Best brunch....ever!,This was the most incredible experience at the Fairmont Austin! Their brunch and environment was like nothing I‚Äôve experienced and food was delicious. Shout out to our bartender Michael! He was very accommodating and helped us along the entire brunch experience üòä I‚Äôm definitely recommending to all friends who are in the Austin area!
5,ENFOS Meeting,"Hotel was very crisp and clean with a beautiful lobby and bar area. The catering facilities on the 7th floor outside deck were very nice. One comment though: we had many meals out there and there was virtually no shade. An easy fix would be to install ""sails"" above the open seating/grassy area that would allow air to move through, but would shade your customers."
5,Above and beyond excellence,"This was by far the best experience I have ever had. From excellent, tasty food at the Revue to customer service requests. Everyone was very nice and professional. Rooms very clean, beds comfortable. Can‚Äôt wait to come back here! Thank you to all at the Fairmont!!!"
5,Everything was great...except the shower,"Shower head in room 1128 was broken - couldn‚Äôt get a full stream of water from the shower head. Most of it came out through the faucet, so I couldn‚Äôt wash my hair properly and ended up being late to an event as a result. Everything else was great. Beautiful rooms, wonderful bed, excellent customer service from the staff."
5,fairmont summer,First time to Austin and the Fairmont couldn't of been better! The staff is amazing!!! The restaurant options are perfect for everyone! The club level was my favorite treat! The staff is so amazing! Made you feel so welcome!
1,9/23 to 9/25,"Check in long lines -- not staffed well enough to handle crowd. Got to the room and key did not work, back down rekeyed 3x before they got it right. Elevators were a joke, No express elevators to the higher floors resulted in stopping at each floor, elevator failed to work on two occasions and had to take stairs, check out long lines mixed with check ins and not enough staff. Construction all around the hotel = not a pleasant setting. Result = Terrible, I would not recommend to anyone."
4,Fairmont Austin,"Rooms are very clean, staff is very nice and helpful. The location is good but the construction around is a little annoying if you have to get out. Hopefully that will be done soon, otherwise I would definitely recommend this hotel."
5,WOW!,"Wow to the bed, pillows, shower, room decor, design, robe and OMG the views from your room. Had an incredible experience and all staff were professional and engaging. Have to start booking my hotel stays at Fairmont only lol"
5,Outstanding hotel with top service,"From the moment I entered the hotel property I was blown away by the kindness of the staff-from the valet, front desk, house keeping, to restaurant/bar and coffee shop staff, everyone I encountered was smiling! The hotel itself is beyond gorgeous. But what made it stand out from the rest was the top notch service. I forgot my toothbrush and asked where I could buy one in the hotel, they were knocking on my door within minutes to deliver one. Jess W went above and beyond to make sure my work stay was comfortable and seamless as this was my first time traveling this far by myself. Thank you!! I stayed in one of the Gold rooms which gave me access to the private lounge, I would highly recommend this! The food and snacks were great, and the private concierge was a total win.My view from the room was beautiful. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in. Very neat layout of the pool, bar, and fitness center. Everything was spotless. This hotel exceeded my expectations and I was very happy with my stay. I will definitely be returning to Fairmont!"
5,Great property... hits all the check boxes,"Great property, centrally located in downtown Austin attached to the convention Center. Fantastic pool area on the 7th floor.A+ property... Also if you had enough bbq food during your visit the margherita pizza at the Fairmont is amazing."
5,Lovely Hotel,"Great Hotel, Great Location for the Convention CenterPerfect Room on 23rd Floor, Nice view of the pool.Loads of space, great staffdesperately trying to fill this review to use the required minimum 200 characters"
5,Amazing Service! Hope to come again!,Everything about this place is top notch! I lost my ID on the plane and they were still able to accommodate me. Staff were all unbelievably pleasant. The drinks are the best that I've had anywhere! The beds are very comfortable and the food is delicious. 100% recommend!
3,below expectations,the parking garage is more frustrating that anyone can imagine. i recommend the GM park there the same way a guest does and then try to get out in a timely manner with their room key. i self parked because last year it took 30 min for valet to get my car... this time it took 10 m even after i pulled up to the kiosk. for $34/ night are you kidding me? WIFI never worked properly for our group which was the STXFDAF- check it out.
5,RTX Experience,I had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont and I would definitely go back for my future trips whenever RTX rolls into Austin. The only minor hiccup that I have is that the incidental fee per night was not included in the total until you get the to front deask to check in. Adding that to the total via online registration would make it a lot easier in budgeting money for your stay.
5,Working stay,Very present staff. Entire hotel was very clean. Relaxing and comfortable. Food was great too. The floors were quite. Beds were comfortable with plenty of pillow. The restrooms in the conference area were always clean. Love that your hotel is pet friendly. I will be back for many reasons.
5,My Pleasure,"Every person that assisted in me in some way always said ""My pleasure"" and I really think they meant it. Your staff has excellent customer service skills. The food that was provided for the ONCO CLOUD reception was phenomenal."
5,The Best Customer Journey,"The people at the Fairmont are amazing. I had my two dogs with me and they treated us so well. Loving on the puppies and making them feel at home. We live in Austin, and yet, staying at The Fairmont made it feel like home even though we weren't in our own. Thank you for great service, amazing food, excellent help, and making our stay so enjoyable!"
5,Austin Hotels,The employees were great -- Jessie and Daly were great on the Gold floor. My only real complaint is that it takes forever to get people to answer the phone...they really need more phone lines and more people answering the phone.
5,Work Trip,"It has a nice pool and jacuzzi that opens at 6am. It is an easy commute to the Austin Convention Center, and the staff is very helpful. Walking distance to the bridge where you can see millions of bats fly around 8pm from May- October."
5,Very Nice Hotel,"The hotel is truly very beautiful, the decor inside the Lobby and in the rooms is excellent. Bathroom and amenities top notch. Kudos also for having Nespresso coffee makers and liquid creamer. Location is amazing in the middle of everything"
5,Conference trip,Beautiful hotel with beautiful interior! All the colors and details were fabulous! I enjoyed the entire stay! The bar and lobby were really pretty and the bar had good drinks! This venue was perfect for the conference I attended
5,Great Austin Hotel,"I went to the Fairmont for a business trip. The hotel staff was all very friendly and super helpful. The hotel lobby was beautifully well done. The hotel had a few restaurants and bars. The food was outstanding everywhere we ate. The hotel is also located within walking distance of several great restaurants. The rooms were a great size and very clean. I used the gym during my visit. Nice large space with several machines (including a Peloton), weights and a space to stretch. They had towels (dry and refrigerated) and water available. I would stay here again."
5,Great Hotel,I had an awesome stay at the Fairmont in Austin Tx. I was in town for a conference and the Fairmont made my trip very enjoyable. I will plan to stay at the Fairmont Austin the next time my travels lead me to Austin Texas.
5,Hello Austin!,"My husband and I were in town for a conference that was being held at the Fairmont. We loved every second of our stay. Every bit of luxury you would expect was available for us. We dined at 3 of the 4 restaurants and everything was amazing. We would highly suggest the Miso bowls at Revue and the Old Fashions at the Fulton.Order room service too!The rooms were impeccably clean, the beds were very comfortable the view was perfect.We will definitely stay there again if we make it back to Austin!"
5,Our favourite Hotel in Austin - Perfect Location,"I go to Austin a couple times a year for business and had a meeting at the Convention Center.I stayed on the top floor, view was outstanding.Very easy access to excellent restaurants in Central Austin and easy to get everywhere on foot or by car.Service was excellent and even when they knew I wasn't a Platinum member. The concierge went out of her way to find us a good vegetarian restaurant which can be a challenge in Austin(when you aren't local).Live music every nightHighly recommended."
5,Another fabulous Fairmont,"stunning first impression, beautiful decor throughout. restaurant Revue, delicious and creative. The banquet food was actually close to hot, unusual for a conference. everyone very friendly and helpful."
5,Best hotel in Austin!,"We have stayed at the Fairmont several times now and it's always a fantastic experience - everything from the room, the view, the pool, the spa, the food and the service have been outstanding. We have stayed at other hotels in Austin and they do not compare to the Fairmont - not even close. I highly recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone visiting Austin or enjoying a staycation - you will love every minute of it."
5,"Nice location, great pool.","Great conference location so close to entertainment and classic Austin food standards. Didn‚Äôt get to the pool until final afternoon, but it is the highlight of this hotel. Would definitely recommend for business travel."
5,Outstanding in every way!,"We have stayed at the fairmont Austin on more than one occasion. We have stayed in almost all the hotels in Austin. This hotel is head and shoulders above the rest. The service is exceptional, the amenities are amazing and the choice of food selection is never ending. You can have Mexican street food on the pool deck, raw oysters in one of the 4 restaurants downstairs or a upscale steak dinner in Garrison. Which by the way has an amazing whiskey offering. We often go for drinks in the ‚Äúlobby‚Äù bar and listen to live music as it‚Äôs always different. The bartenders always come Up with something fun for us and the bar menu for food is delicious. Try their chicken nuggets!This past stay we went all out and went to the spa. WOW!!!! McKenzie was fantastic. I‚Äôm not a spa guy so he made me feel at home with a tour and had me setup for a massage and hot tub dip. The view is incredible from up there. I see why they were named Austin‚Äôs #1 new spa.But what really strikes us each time we go and why I feel so compelled to right this, is the consistency of service and quality. The rooms are amazing, clean and have everything you could think of. We all try those new hotspots and the time or two they do great and then over time the service and quality slip. Not the case here. They never disappoint and go above and beyond to make our stay special. Not only is but our whole community is thought of from UT home games to Austin Pride. Keep an eye on the top of the building and the big tower as they often light it up and do special designs to support the community.Thanks Fairmont Austin team!!!!"
5,Thank You Rene!,"First off I must say, this hotel is stunning. Absolutely perfect design aspects every where I looked. Its centrally located, with everything you need around. But what really made the experience was the help I got on the way out from Rene Valdez, who was working the bell desk. I had some EXTREMELY heavy equipment (and a lot of us) and he was so kind and helpful in getting everything where I needed it to do. I couldn't have done that without him."
5,Room with a View,"I was able to stay in a corner room on the 26th floor and the view was spectacular. The food was great and the staff is so, so helpful and friendly. I loved the hotel. It is a great location and very easy to get around."
5,Fairmont Austin TX,"We stayed at the Fairmont Austin for a business meeting. The hotel in in the heart of Austin and just a few blocks fro UT, the West End as well as the heart of the city on Congress street. Easy walking distance to many food options and entertainment.The staff is remarkable, over the top with service and making sure that each and every guest is attended to. Everyone was friendly, always at your service and willing to go the extra mile if needed. From the check process, to the rooms attendants to the personnel in the food outlets, you were always greeted with a smile and a friendly what can I do for you today.Our room was overlooking the pool area which was very active for this time of year. The pool is a is a rooftop pool located on the 7th floor of the hotel and is everything you would want in a pool and expect at a Fairmont property. Private cabanas, in pool lounge chairs, hot tub and patio bar and grill.What more could one ask for in an urban environment.Over all the Fairmont is a great property with great people and great amenities. Can't wait to go back."
5,Amazing,"I visited this hotel on a business trip and it was beautiful! It was very busy, the bartender said they were at full capacity. When I checked in they had the longest line, I was surprised they had someone walking around handing out water and the man who checked us in even came around the desk to greet us when it was out turn. I had a great stay and really enjoyed my entire time in Austin."
5,Every detail taken care of,Went for a Convention. We were excited to stay at the Fairmont based on the reviews. It lived up to our expectations. The staff is GREAT! Loved the downtown area. Used the FedEx business center several times while there. Their staff was great also.
5,"Beautiful, clean, comfortable - SUPER FRIENDLY","As far as 4-star hotels go, this one was as pretty, clean and comfortable as I would expect. However, the people who work there are SUPER FRIENDLY and really made me feel like family. Also, the location is great! You can walk to some of the more trendy areas of Austin for shops and eats. And, it's a 5-minute walk to the bridge where you can watch the bats at sunset."
5,Phenomenal Hotel!!!,"Service was exceptional! room was clean and nice, pool was awesome! The Garrison was well thought out and super convenient. All the food we had there was up to par with the upscale experience. I would stay here again without even thinking about it. =)"
5,Fairmont - Excellent hotel in the heart of Austin,This is an amazing property to stay in Austin for business or pleasure. Great location. excellent service.. I was in Austin for a convention. Fairmont is connected to the Convention centre. There are lot of good restaurants and bars around Fairmont. The hotel is really cool and new.
5,Help Friendly Clean,"Highly recommend the Fairmont in Austin Texas. The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The hotel is well maintained and has every amenity anyone would need. Good people, great time!!"
5,Fairmont Austin,"Beautiful hotel and rooms. Our room had a great window view. Staff very friendly and helpful. The concierge staff helped us plan a day trip in the area. We ate at several different restaurants, in the hotel ,and the food was great!üòä"
5,Austin Weekend Trip,Great stay at the Fairmont Austin. Very comfortable sleeping conditions and excellent service. We upgraded to Fairmont Gold as a treat to ourselves and enjoyed the extra amenities such as breakfast and happy hour.
5,Always Nice to Stay at the Fairmont....,"Our room was lovely, the view was incredible and the staff went over and above. I was quite impressed with how quick room service delivered our food. Housekeeping did a very nice job every day. The restaurant (Garrison's) was delicious and I quite enjoyed the way the brunch was served. Eclectic menu and attentive servers. I will definitely stay at this hotel again."
5,Best place to stay downtown Austin!,"Out of this world service. Perfect location, awesome salt water pool, large hot tub, comfy beds, large rooms, best restaurant downstairs Garrison's. Great coffee shop downstairs. Decor is gorgeous! It is a must!"
5,Great stay as always,"This hotel is remarkable. It is a little expensive, but not more so than the typical nice downtown hotel. The service is impeccable, and the rooms are generally pretty quiet. It is new, but it is getting busier. We shall see how it handles the increased business."
5,Great Experience!,The service along with the room food and atmosphere was excellent. If i came back to Austin i would Stay here again with no hesitation. The location was also perfect. The front desk (Jess) was so accommodating and super nice!
3,Nice hotel but lacks some important guest needs.,"While service, cleanliness and sleep quality (insulation from outside noise) were excellent, some critical needs were overlooked that made it no better than an average hotel.We were at a conference on the 3rd floor. When a session was over, massive lines formed at the elevators. Seemed like only one elevator was ""in service"" for that floor. We ended up going down to the 2nd floor. Got an elevator immediately and it bypassed the 3rd floor and went directly to the 15th floor. Should be able to schedule more of them to be available for conference breaks.Room lacks proper drawer space both in the bathroom and in the sleeping area. It appears that you missed an opportunity to have two drawers under the sink on the left. You're also short of bars for hanging towels to dry. If you want us to reuse them, give us some place to hang the wet towels. Finally, there was only one hook for bathrobes, pajamas, etc. That's not good when there are two people in the room."
5,Beautiful Property and Impeccable Service!,"My stay at the Fairmont was fantastic. The only downside is that you must pay for internet use - would be nice to include.Otherwise, this is the perfect spot to stay in Austin. The pool it awesome and it is within walking distance to Rainey St."
5,Recommendation of Fairmont Auxtin,The Fairmont Hotel was beautiful as well as well located to restaurants and entertainment. The staff was helpful and courteous. The room was well appointed and very comfortable. I would recommend the Fairmont to anyone that is visiting Austin.
5,Best hotel in the USA,"I genuinely enjoyed my stay at the Fairmont Austin. Every detail was perfect, the service could not be faulted, the bed so comfortable. Great location, walking distance to downtown and several other attractions."
5,Great Service without having to ask for it,I had a great experience at the Fairmont. Simple things done right. I asked for a room close to the elevator they accommodated no problem. There was a mistake made on a room service order once but I notified them and the meal was remade very quickly. and I received a follow-up call shortly thereafter asking if everything was okay and although I didn't ask for it they removed the charge from my bill. I like getting great service without having to ask for it.
5,Work Conference,"Loved the pool area, used it every night, very clean and friendly. The food that was prepared for are event meals were all good and on time. I also used the gym, it was very clean and machines worked well for me. The room was nice, had a great view of the river."
5,Excellent Stay!,"The Fairmont in Austin was beautiful and did a great job with the event I attended. More importantly- the staff was kind, considerate, and super accommodating. They are pet-friendly too. Highly recommend!!!"
5,Signature Travel Attendace,"Thank you for an incredible stay. While the hotel was marvelous physically, the best part of your hotel is your people. Everyone from the bar staff, concierge, security, are personable, customer-oriented people."
5,Most comfortable hotel,The people were very friendly and helpful. The restaurants are the best. The room service was spotless. The beds extremely comfortable. The location of this hotel is excellent. I have nothing but positives to say.
5,Loved it!,"Was in Austin at a conference and stayed at the Fairmont and really loved it. Everyone was very professional and I was thrilled that there was a room available when I arrived quite early. I did have to upgrade for this but the upcharge was reasonable and being able to get settled was worth it and I am sure hotel was happy to have the extra revenue. I had minimal interaction with the front desk but they were friendly.There was quiet a lot of interaction with banqueting staff and they were all very efficient and friendly and wait for drinks, coffee etc was never an issue.The bar in the lobby was generally hopping at night and again service was terrific there.I had breakfast one morning at the Food Hall where they had a la carte and buffet (eggs to order from the menu included in the buffet) and want to make special mention of Zack who went out of his way to make this a great experience. He was very attentive and even brought me a sampling of the crepes from their creperie while I waited for the eggs. I know everyone thinks I am crazy but I was not in love with Austin and found the Fairmont to be a welcome oasis when returning from being out.My only negative is that Rules And Regs is not bigger as a pool bar / dining area and never seemed to have a vibe that one expects at pool bars.The rooms were great and had excellent wifi. The bathrooms are fantastic!"
5,Awesome hotel,The Fairmont Austin May be the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at. The lobby and 7th floor lounges were incredible and the service was remarkable‚Äîspecifically Duncan Bledsoe who continually went above and beyond over the course of the 4 day visit. Thanks Duncan!
4,Fantastic rooms,Good hotel. Best rooms with comfortable beds. Great housekeeping. Restaurant is awesome with so many options. Lobby very nice. Hotel is walking distance to great restaurants and entertainment. Pool is good but very busy. Gym is ok but no locker room.
5,Sonic Convention,"Most areas of operation run efficiently. Best service from concierge and bell, the front desk and convention services. Excellent attitude among staff. All of them! Some procedures when it comes servicing a group seemingly outdated or unnecessarily complicated."
5,Beautiful,We booked last year for my birthday and will probably book again. The pool is amazing and the staff is super nice. We ate at a restaurant in the hotel and it was very romantic for my boyfriend and I. The bars in downtown are also in walking distance.
5,Bachelorette fun,"We had a suite booked to celebrate a friend.As soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted and every employee was very courteous and helpful throughout our stay. The rooms were clean, and the soaps and shampoo spelled amazing!!! Our Ac wasn't working, but they came up quickly and fixed it. It is walking distance to many places which made it very convenient . There are a couple bars and restaurants on premise as well. It is a beautiful hotel on the inside. I would definitely stay there again if I was to return."
5,Labor Day Weekend,Love this hotel. It's like Las Vegas in Austin. The location is great as it's with an Uber or scooter ride to everything. Pool deck is fantastic and the views are great from all sides. This is one of our favorite hotels in downtown Austin.
5,Great business,"I stayed here for a conference that was right in the hotel and really just thought it was a very enjoyable experience to stay on business. Super clean, nice comfortable rooms and bed. Staff were friendly and really good. Location was very convenient for multiple reasons including close to the highway.Enjoyed a couple trips to the Rainey Street district nearby for some great samples of the locally-brewed beer."
5,Awesome Experience,"This hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly! If ever in Austin again, I would love to stay again! Thanks Randall for making my checkout so smooth. Randall was my bellman when I was checking out! We talked about spiritual things and his faith made my day."
5,Will Return,beautiful hotel with clean/modern amenities. Visited the spa and not only was the service detailed but the offerings were wide. They provided delicious treats and supplied Dyson Blow Dryers! I will absolutely return.
4,A young hip Fairmont,"I have stayed at and visited various Fairmont properties. This is not your mother's Fairmont. This shiny glass tower was a surprise to me. I am a frequent cruiser and if this building rocked a little you would think you were on a luxury cruise ship. The venues tip their hat to the cruise experience. There is a ""food court"" type experience, a grab and go deli, a tree themed bar, a large beautiful pool, and a hip indoor/outdoor bar. The decor embraces the current trends. Our room was beautiful. The bathroom was especially luxurious. The floor to ceiling windows overlooked the crane filled downtown, The housekeeping staff seemed timid, but were nice and attentive. You can't change the location. It is close to many fun eateries if you want to get out of the hotel. The building does sit along a busy highway and the noise was noticeable even though we were on the 20th floor. Stay away from the minibar. There is one bottle of each type of alcohol listed at a startling high price. Go to the bars instead. The drinks are reasonably priced for a high end hotel. This place is designed for conferences, but it has enough of luxury to make it a good honeymoon spot too. The short walk to many pubs and eateries also make this a good place to stay. I would recommend requesting a high room on the side of the building furthest from the highway. A unique, fun and relaxing experience."
5,My Stay at the Austin Fairmont,"The hotel exceeded my expectations. Everything was beautiful with perfect touches. From the cocktail napkins, the hotel decor and even the holder for an invoice at dinner. My room was beautiful, clean, roomy and nothing was out of place. I would stay here again for sure! PS: The staff was also approachable, friendly, warm and helpful."
5,They even helped fix my camera,"On my flight over here a key part of my camera broke.I didn't have time to buy a replacement. Dallas at the concierge desk offered to help. She started calling the maintenance people to see if they had some glue that would help.Then Robert noticed that I have the exact camera he has. He helped me use the glue to get everything back in order.Now I have a way to capture memories from this trip.This is the kind of stuff that brings me back to this hotel over and over and over again. I love the Fairmont in general, but the one here in Austin is especially great because of its location and people."
5,Great spot in Austin,"The Fairmont is a great hotel in Austin. Close to Congress St., lots of restaurants downtown and music venues. We enjoyed jazz in the Elephant Room, Honky Tonk Country music at the Constitution Club and blues at Antone‚Äôs thanks to recommendations from the concierge. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. A very nice stay."
5,A1 great hotel.,"Clean beautiful excellent in every way. The service was great, decor was beautiful. I honestly wish I could have stayed a month, instead of a weekend. Food at the restaurant was really good. Loved every minute."
5,Wonderful Artistic Environment,"This is a brand new five star hotel. So it's the best in town. It is a perfect example that the modern architecture, modern artistic vision and modern technology can be combined so nicely to lead people to enjoy something much more beyond what the physical space could offer. The lobby and all the restaurants are all created as wonderful picturesque spots. I enjoyed the gold service a lot. The location is very convenient to walk around everywhere. I have done the hiking on every direction from the hotel. There are a lot restaurants with quite diverse menu in the surrounding area. So you can easily find something you like."
5,Review,The Club service was exceptional. I will stay here again for future trips to Austin. Had to fly in early and having our room ready for 7:30 am really made our trip a much better trip as we were able to rest prior to our lunch meeting. Staff was friendly and helpful.
2,Not worth the nearly $300/nite,"When I pay nearly $300/nite, I expect things to be perfect. The Fairmont fell short in several areas:1) The bed was hard as a rock. C‚Äômon folks, this is hotel 101-level stuff. I you want $300 heads-in-beds, it‚Äôs gotta be a decent bed.2) Why oh why do high-end hotel operators have this infatuation with feather pillows ? I don‚Äôt get it. They‚Äôre not hypoallergenic, and provide no support at all. If you doo provide feather pillows, you should at least make other options available. Which brings me to my next item:3) I did not receive a ‚Äúhow is your room‚Äù call or phone message. If Jaz has time to write a note and deliver chocolates in response to my online survey, s/he can at least contact me when there is still time to remedy my problem.4) The room lighting is poor. Even with every light on, I still couldn‚Äôt see well enough to operate that complicated coffeemaker you‚Äôve hidden in that dark cubby.5) There was still trash in the can at the desk. Sure it was just a candy wrapper, but it could have been a paper with the previous guest‚Äôs name or other info on it."
5,Love the Fairmont Austin!,We had a great time and always enjoy Fairmont properties. This one didn‚Äôt disappoint. We will be back! The location is great and the Gold Lounge was a good as it gets. The staff were all accommodating from valet to staff at restaurants. A real gem!
5,Perfect!!,"Everything from the service, room cleanliness, view, bed comfort, food choices, friendly staff...Everything was perfect. I‚Äôm trying to organize another trip with friends so I can stay there again! See you soon!"
3,Needs Improvement,"The beds are hard as rock. It resulted in poor sleep and back pain. The valet service was terrible! Make sure to use the self park option or you‚Äôll be waiting on your car for excessive periods of time. You can text for your car but we routinely got the message that it was too busy for them to accept the text and we were forced to take our ticket down to the valet stand and then wait and wait and wait some more. When the conference ended, everyone was checking out at the same time so the line to check out was ridiculous. It took an hour to get the car and get out of the hotel even without standing in the check out line. We were charged $7.00 for a water we did not use but it wasn‚Äôt worth the wait in line to dispute it. The hotel should either staff up for these kinds of check out events or they should not make everyone check out by 10am. The food served at the conference was very mediocre. We didn‚Äôt try room service or the restaurants. The rooms are attractive with a very nice bathroom and amenities. You can‚Äôt use the mini bar to store anything because of design. Generally, it was not a good experience."
5,Longhorn vs LSU Tigers weekend unbeaten Austin,UT vs LSU Football weekend fully packed hotel not one empty room. The Fairmont was able to provide great service and it was a delightful stay. Even with the hotel completely full. The staff was delightful and reservations was efficient. Pool was crazy full overwhelming and bailed
5,Top-notch hotel,"We stayed at the Fairmont on Friday and Saturday night - if you want a sleepy, boring, nothing-going-on hotel, don‚Äôt stay here! There were a great number of wedding parties, bachelor parties, bachelorette parties, and just plain parties going on the whole time, but also lots of young families on vacation - a really attractive social vibe all around. Hotel staff was available, friendly, and very helpful in all way. Our room was clean, quiet, well-appointed. All in all, a great stay. And rather than being in the middle of downtown, it‚Äôs conveniently located on the edge, within easy walking distance of the downtown dining and night life. Oh, and the AC in the room was unobtrusive but very effective - one of my pet peeves about hotels/motels. This hotel is a little pricey, but well worth it! Very good value!"
5,6 Stars if that were possible,We stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights the weekend of the LSU vs Texas football game in September 2019. This place is fantastic in every aspect. From arrival to departure everything is first class. Anyone who gives this hotel 4 stars or less is just looking for nit picky items to criticize. Geaux Tigers!!!
5,The Best!,I stay in hotels at least 16 days out of a year and this hotel and it's staff far exceeded ANY I've stayed in! Every employee I had contact with was courteous and helpful. The hotel was pristine and provided all the amenities you'd need if you never left it. ...but there were plenty of venues within walking distance as well if you so desired. The only downside is the traffic. Plenty of patience is mandatory while driving in this area. I loved this place and would recommend it to anyone traveling in this area of Austin.
1,Nice Hotel but dirty stinky city,"I enjoyed the Hotel but would likely stay somewhere else. As a licensed to carry citizen, I find it disappointing I cannot enter and leave your establishment protected while being surrounded by bums, homeless persons and plain crazy people. I watched a deranged person chase a hotel guest all the way to International House of Pancakes. I will go where I can protect myself."
5,Outstanding,The Fairmont is an absolutely beautiful hotel. Upon check in the staff was helpful and very courteous. The service was excellent. The room was clean and wonderful. I would stay there again and hope to visit soon.
5,Beautiful Spa!,"I had a wonderful experience at the Fairmont Spa. My massage therapist Nina was fantastic and delivered a truly relaxing experience. Everything from the staff to the facilities was top notch with a beautiful relaxation lounge, solarium with whirlpool and sauna and steam room! I would highly recommend and will definitely be back!"
5,Great hotel with Great customer service,"I booked the Fairmont last minute because the hotel I booked was was doing maintenance on their pool. The service at the Fairmont was excellent beginning with the young men at Valet to the bellhop who helped me with my luggage. Each of these young men called me by name throughout my overnight stay. What a wonderful way to train employees! The pool was nice and the service was also great however, it was difficult to find a pool chair as it was crowded on a Friday afternoon. I did book my stay through a third-party/ last minute which is why I was able to afford it for the night."
5,Fabulous new hotel in downtown Austin,"Great corner room with fantastic views; very clean; friendly, helpful staff. Will definitely stay here again. Location is super, direct connection with the Austin Convention Center. Only little problem I encountered was substituting my room card for in-and-out of the garage. Had to call for help from the exit gate."
4,Top Notch,"I stayed there on Wednesday the 3rd of September. The hotel staff was in the weeds. The Texas politician convention was going on and the parking garage was full. I was checking in at 6pm and had nowhere to park. The front desk told me to park across the street and I would be reimbursed when I check out in the morning. I paid $400.00 to park mine and my guests car. When checked out , I was only reimbursed 32.00 while being charged for valet when we had to move our vehicles from across the street as we only had the option to pay until midnight. One front desk guy, one manager said I would get my money back then when I check out the front desk girl doesn't honor either employees promise to me. I was disappointed slightly , everything else was good. Just wish that I wasn't treated like a number."
5,Awesome Hotel and Conference Center,"This was a conference stay. Only issue was traffic and some getting into hotel. Self parking underground filled quickly, but Valet service was excellent, as were staff and all attendants! A Great place to stay!"
5,Great location!,Very expensive room service. Ordered a cheeseburger and very delicious flan. It was $50.00. Good but not that good.Very nice employees checking in and checking out. Clean and pretty and good training rooms.
5,Great valet service,"Very busy Texas vs LSU weekend for this hotel but we had excellent service at the valet, going over and above by helping with gear and supplies to and from a big tailgate event, in extreme heat. Shawn was especially awesome!!Room and Gold lounge service was good, as expected. Bell service took a long time with bags but stepped it up and delivered when we told them we had a timing issue."
5,Best Nice Sleep in a Hotel,"I love Fairmonts. I travel for work frequently and travel for fun on occasion and I rarely get a good night's sleep in a hotel room. Not true at the Fairmont in Austin. I slept so well. The staff was pleasant, I had a nice dinner, and the room was quiet despite the fact that the rooms next to me were occupied. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean and the thermostat in the room actually worked."
5,Excellent,best service ; great staff ; amazing rooms ; clean ; all the things one would want ;; super nice ; loved staying at this hotel ; did i mention the staff was incredible legit the best ever that I‚Äôve came in contact with ;
5,The Fairmont Hotel in Austin,"The Fairmont Hotel in Austin is an exquisite hotel with excellent service from the minute you arrive to the second you leave. The hotel staff is exemplary and go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. Although the trip was business related, I cannot wait to return to The Fairmont!"
2,Too Big for Good Service,"The SERVICE at this hotel is AWFUL. It is simply TOO BIG. They make you WAIT for EVERYTHING. It took over an hour to get a bellman to my room, stand in line to check out and then wait on my car from the valet which, they charge almost $50 to PARK! Also, the bed was hard as a rock. Staying somewhere else next time."
5,Jordonne at front desk is the best!,"I stayed at the Fairmont over Labor Day Weekend, the start to the trip had me worried when booking.com didn't get my reservation over to the hotel. The staff at the Fairmont made sure to fix the issue and get me the correct room even on a busy weekend, and sent a gift to the room as well.But the best part of the trip was Jordonne, she helped me multiple times throughout the trip ensure that me and my guests had a great time. Either at the pool, coordinating plans, or helping to speed things up during such a crowded weekend at the hotel, she made sure we were taken care of and went out of her way to be helpful. The entire staff was great but if you want to make sure you have a good stay, find Jordonne."
5,Great Hotel,Very stylish new hotel with an amazing pool and stylish in-room furnishings. Great location if attending an event at the convention center. Hotel lobby bar with live music was spacious and bright with a good energy.
4,Labor Day/ Splash day,"Overall a great experience staying at Fairmont Gold experience. From the exclusive check in on the 35th floor with your own personal concierge that you can communicate thru text and the lounge filled with goodies, everything is awesome!!Only comment was that the pool was dirty and the water lounges have green stuff growing on them. I expected that the place/pool will be packed since it‚Äôs the long weekend but I think there should be system in maintaining the pool more sanitary during peak times. Also since the heat can be sometimes unbearable they should put out more umbrellas."
1,#neverback #Horribleservice #Notrust,worst service was at the restaurant/ the Server was Very mean I had he want me to leave the buffet breakfast plus They add extra tips I did not put it on my bill . And the first night the charge me 3 time the price for a regular buffet breakfast ( $76 )It‚Äôs supposed to be $18 for person .I can‚Äôt believe
5,First trip to Austin,"Visited Austin for the first time to help family members move from Europe to Austin. The hotel was perfectly located for us and I enjoyed meeting various hotel employees, who seem to be from all around the world. It was delightful to meet French speaking staff and others from European countries as well as other parts of the world. The hotel is new and very well taken care of. I enjoyed my time at the hotel and can't wait to come back."
5,Fairmont Downtown Austin,"The Fairmont never disappoints. Beautiful hotel, and wonderful staff. We used the complimentary bikes on Sunday morning, the staff was so helpful getting us all set up. The pool was really nice, we enjoyed our stay."
5,Best Hotel in Austin,"Nice location, great restaurants, nice pool, fantastic outside bar with stunning views- what‚Äôs not to like at a reasonable price. Easy walk to Rainey street bars. Harrison restaurant is one of the best in Austin but their regular restaurant has options for all kinds of items and at decent prices."
5,VERY NICE!,"Very nice hotel. Food is good, drinks/bar area is very nice. Rooms are comfortable, large, clean. Has everything you need. GREAT Nespresso coffee maker. Great wifi. All very nice.Very nice, helpful staff everywhere you went."
5,Lovely Venue,"The Fairmont Austin went beyond meeting our expectations. Beautiful art all around. Superb, friendly service. Creative and delicious cocktails in all the bars. Bed was extremely comfortable.The Revue was pricy, but the eggs, bacon, potatoes, and grilled cherry tomatoes well above average. The charcuterie and cheese plates exceptional. The Caesar salad was too lemony for my taste. The dessert shake was yummy.Garrison's was a superb fine dining venue. The 48 oz porterhouse with garlic bordelaise sauce was juicy, tender and delicious. For the price I thought it was a bargain. The branzino was perfectly cooked. The deserts were beautiful and delicious-Ile Flottante, and textures of carrot.service was spot-on.Highly Recommended!"
5,Moving in our Freshman to UT,We loved the location as we needed somewhere close to UT Austin as we were moving in our son to his dorm. The rooms were amazing and love the color scheme. Lobby is live and kicking. It did take a long time to check in but you do get individual attention which is great. At check out the Valet lost our key but the Valet manager booked us an Uber to do our brunch location and after locating our keys came personally to drop off our truck and bags. No complains. Highly recommend Fairmont Austin to all family and friends.
2,Average place to stay,Rooms are nice but the temperature is very cold. The food is very average. (bad breakfast with dry smoked salmon) The hotel allows outside people to use the swimming pool so it was full and we couldn't use it.
4,Nice business stay,I recently stayed in this hotel for two nights for a conference in the hotel. Room was spacious for a city hotel. WiFi worked well and room was very quiet. I had no problems while staying at this hotel.
5,Great hotel at a great location.,"Honestly, the hotel can only be described as amazing.It was super clean, had a luxurious appeal, and had excellent customer service. The concierge desk and the check in desk were extremely helpful and nice for first timers like us who did not know the area at all. House keeping was very respectful of your belongings and always courteous if they arrived and you were still in the room. Also, depending on which part of the hotel your room is placed in, you will have a beautiful view of downtown or Lady Bird Lake.The location of the hotel is great because downtown is within walking distance. To add to that the hotel provides a drop off service for you to be dropped off anywhere within a mile of the hotel if you just want to walk back from and not to your destination. Our only issue was that the hotel parking can get a little expensive if you're there for a longer stay. Since everything is so close, unless you are planning on traveling far, a rental might be necessary.Ultimately, the hotel definitely made it a well worth trip and we would definitely use the Fairmont Austin again."
5,Visit to Austin.,The Fairmont in downtown Austin is a beautiful hotel conveniently located to all the the best restaurants and nightlife. Hotel staff are very helpful and accommodating. Beautiful rooms. Modern and comfortable. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommend.
5,Amazing service,"This hotel was amazing. Rene Valdez, an employee, showed just how wonderful customer service could be when I needed something early in the morning. He spared no time making sure everything was taken care of. I highly recommend him and this hotel for your stay in downtown Austin."
5,I LOVE this hotel,"The Fairmont Austin is the best place to stay in the city. Their restaurants are fantastic, their staff are friendly and accommodating, their amenities are great, the pool is amazing! They also have a really great live music program at the hotel with local Austin artists. I highly Recommend staying here"
5,Beautiful property - definitely will stay again,The Fairmont Austin is an absolutely beautiful property. I was impressed with the overall design of the hotel from the lobby to the restaurants to the coffee shop. It really had everything we needed. We were able to have a lunch meeting at Rules and Regs and I was really impressed with the healthy menu and lovely setting.
2,Beautiful Disaster,"Don't get me wrong, the hotel is absolutely beautiful! The staff, very nice as well. It was a staycation for us, celebrating our anniversary. We thought we can relax in our room, enjoy the pool, maybe get a massage, order some movies and room service and get some decent rest. Well... the pool was bombarded with bros and bachelorettes, not a place to sit in sight. Once in, I didn't even want to look at the things floating around in the water. We were lucky enough to actually be sharing walls with a bachelorette party, always a good time.... wrong.... DON'T order the eggs benedict unless you want to INSTANTLY lose 5 pounds while on the toilet. The acai bowl was watery and the worst we've had. To top it off, we couldn't even order a movie in our room because the TV guide was out of order. Not worth the $500 we spent for one night ($355 for the room and the rest in room service). You're better off ordering from IHOP across the road... at least you know what you're getting. This would never happen at the Mariott or Hilton."
5,Fairmont rocks!,"This hotel has everything you need. Great customer service, restaurants, meeting rooms, FedEx, and the cutest little coffee shop! The live music during the afternoons and evenings help to set a mood. The bar was fully stocked at all times with a wide selection."
5,"Recent Stay at the Fairmont, Austin",The chair and ottoman in the room had stains. Perhaps housekeeping should note this and clean/shampoo when required. And please don't ask for 200 characters maximum before submitting this survey.Once the point is made one should be able to submit.
5,SImply Spectacular Hotel,"Just completed a tour of the Fairmont and words can not explain the many amenities of this hotel. Floor to ceiling windows in beautifully spacious rooms. The rooftop pool and sauna with lounge chairs in the pool. The Spa offers a relaxing atmosphere the moment you walk through the door.The Fairmont offers meeting/event room space to accommodate groups of every size. Michelle O.‚Äôs personable personality and presentation of The Fairmont Hotel was OUTSTANDING! If looking for a location to host your meeting, look no further than The Fairmont!Simply Spectacular!"
5,Great stay & service,"We recently stayed at this wonderful hotel and were treated to a superb stay. The hotel is beautifully appointed, very comfortable, and in a great location. Trendy & fun Rainey's St is just out the back door.The service was equally as wonderful but William Barlow, our bellman, was especially superb. He made sure we were comfortably situated in our beautiful room and explained all the features within. Then not only did he recommended a good restaurant but he actually went to get the Fairmont van and drive us there!Also, I use a c-pap machine and it uses distilled water. Having just flown in, we did not have any liquids due to the plane and needed the distilled water. After dropping us at the restaurant, William went to the store and bought, from his own money, distilled water which we found waiting for us back in our room. Now THAT is service! And if that were not enough, William & the bell staff left us a box of chocolates in our room.So THANK YOU William Barlow for going above and beyond."
5,They are getting there,"The hotel is magnificent, but attention to detail is lacking for a property like this. The new carpets in the room are tattered on the end where it meets the wood floor. The bathroom glass shower banged whenever it was closed (something the housekeeper had to know). The bathrobe in the closet was worn through. Some employees never make eye contact which was frustrating. Overall I'd stay there again, just tighten up your game."
5,Love the Fairmont!,"We had a girl‚Äôs trip to Austin and this was the perfect location and what a gorgeous atmosphere they have created! Fairmont offers complimentary drivers in a specified area, Chase and Adam helped us get to a few special places in the city. They were charming, engaging and helps us like the friendly locals that they are. Greg in the spa was another stellar employee! We highly recommend this location!"
5,Top hotel in Austin,Beautiful spacious rooms with amazing views. The pool area is wonderful and located on the 7th floor with views of the city. The food is excellent (both poolside and at the restaurant). 5 star service provided by all of the staff especially the concierge Ekta. Highly recommend this hotel for all.
5,Fantastic hotel and located near everything,Great hotel. The lobby bar with live music is great. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool had great atmoshpere. The gym was large and well equipped. Really enjoyed the ease of access to all of downtown Austin and parking garage and access to ride share was very easy. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Austin.
3,Fairmont austin,"Key cards broke a few times and pool top isn‚Äôt as clean as it looks in the photo, but really good service and very comfy beds. For the price, I expected a little more, but staff was super accommodating. Whatever we needed, they brought right up to our room. The restaurant attached fills up quickly, so if you‚Äôre interested in Sunday brunch, make reservations ahead of time."
4,Weekend in Austin,"Hotel is clean, well run and one of the best I stayed while in Austin. The food options are plentiful albeit a bit pricey but that is expected at a hotel of this caliber. The pool however was overly crowded / too small for this size hotel."
5,7th stay,"The hotel is the best in Austin. Comfortable rooms, great amenities. This was our 7th stay and it just keeps up the high standards every time. The valet parking is challenging when buy but otherwise the hotel was perfect."
5,Great location and close to the city center. Clean rooms and very comfortable beds,The Fairmont Austin Is a little expensive but is well worth the money. Very clean rooms and comfortable beds and pillows. Room service was excellent plus breakfast was served on time and delicious. I will definitely come back.
5,Top notch all the way!,"We‚Äôve been spoiled. Rarely have I ever had a hotel stay go so flawlessly.We were greeted at check in with a welcoming attitude and professional demeanor. It proceeded quickly and efficiently. We were only staying in Austin a day and a half, and upon asking were offered a map with custom directions and insider tips regarding restaurants and ‚Äúthings to do ‚Äú . Our room was clean and spacious and offered floor to ceiling views of the river, skyline and pool (we stayed on the 22nd floor). There was a well stocked bar and fridge , but we needed space for a few ‚Äúbrought along ‚Äú snacks. Within minute of contacting the front desk a polite employee was rolling in a mini fridge for us !Heading down to the bar next , the bartender, after learning that I was not imbibing, mixed up a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail. Onto food. ..we happened upon the in house restaurant Garrison but were concerned that it was set to close shortly, The hostess assured us that it wold not be a problem and it wasn‚Äôt. The service and treatment by the wait staff was impeccable as was the food. Note : we are foodies and from New Orleans , we know our way around fine dining and fine it was. There was no rushed feeling or attitude even though we lingered well past closing , even changing our minds and ordering coffee and desert. The next day we discover a coffee, etc place right off of the lobby called Good Things. Coffee, pastries and prepared salads and sandwiches were available.....and very good. Next stop, the pool. ...saltwater and perfect temperature with waiters bringing drinks and snacks as we cooled off. A waiter apparently forgot my order (once ) and when I walked up to the bar to check on it a manager type person spotted me and before I could even state the problem, addressed me by name , apologized and said the order would be out shortly and comped it. I‚Äôm rather embarrassed to say that we were having so much fun at the pool that it was our last stop of the night . Later when hunger kicked in , a call to room service(minutes before the regular menu turned into the ‚Äúlate night menu, we were allowed to order exactly what we wanted ....scallops, shrimp cocktail, hamburger and Brussel sprouts, yummy. Seeing how late it was , a quick call to the front desk and we were ‚Äúok‚Äôd‚Äù for a late checkout (1 pm). I wish I had names ..I don‚Äôt , so I‚Äôll just say this ..it was everyone. Great job from start to finish."
5,Wow - just wow - Fairmont Gold,"If you are going to Austin and want to stay in a hotel, the Fairmont Gold is the way to go. The hotel, in general, is well-located (we were there Thurs - Sun and walked everywhere) and very nice. The food and beverage options are many and all good. But do yourself a favor and book a room on the Gold level. Great breakfast, all-day snacks, self-service honor bar, very ample hot and cold food spread from 5 -7...makes going to a store to buy room provisions for a multi-day stay completely unnecessary. The service is great, too - attentive and friendly. We have stayed at nice hotels all over the U.S., Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, and this hotel may be the best for overall quality and guest experience."
5,Echols Family meets in Austin,"The Fairmont Gold experience as wonderful. The friendly, accommodating staff went out of their way to enhance our stay. First class concierge service in longe. The restaurants (Sunday brunch and poolside) were terrific. Delightful rooms and amenities. Location cannot be beat!"
5,Great Hotel/Best Staff,"The Fairmont staff provided one of the best experiences I have ever had at a hotel. They were incredibly warm and friendly and addressed any questions or concerns within moments.The hotel itself was great. Large, clean, quiet rooms within walking distance to almost anything you could want. We were in and out quite a bit, so the self-park option was also great.I have stayed in many hotels in Austin from boutiques to larger chains and would recommend the Fairmont over any of them. I‚Äôll be back in town in a month - had I not prepaid for my upcoming stay at another hotel, I would cancel and reserve at the Fairmont.Everything was great, but the staff were the highlight."
5,Amazing service and people,I went into revue one night expecting to just grab a bite and leave but was treated with so much more. I had the pleasure of being helped by Kyle and Liz. Kyle made incredible drinks and was very attentive. Liz was so helpful and made great recommendations on food since I have dietary restrictions and couldn‚Äôt eat everything on the menu! Both of them are fantastic and next time I‚Äôm in Austin I will definitely be back.
5,"Wonderful property, staff & location","Have had the opportunity to stay on two separate occasions. First impression was backed up by a repeat performance. The property is great for work or play. Service from the staff is always friendly. Location has you close to many restaurants and entertainment options.The one area where some may find fault is the dining venue. The concept is cool but can be misunderstood. Simply put there are multiple food types and sub areas all under one roof. You can order Italian, Korean, or even fresh oysters all off the same menu regardless of what area you are seated. Service will pick up at the different kitchens and being to you. This allows your group to each get what they want without having to bounce around or fight over what to eat. Pretty nice."
5,Fairmont-for-a-Cause--Wonderful,"We attended a fundraising gala for Big Brothers Brothers Big Sisters/Central Texas, and the event was everything it needed to be:ambiance, quality, heart-strings and memories. The entire tone was beautifully set from the start by Andrea at the front desk, who, for the tiniest dollars, provided a room upgrade with a smile. Krishnae capped it off with a checkout with grace. So now I'll tell clients, ""not only is it avbona fide 5-star hotel, but I've personally stayed there and it truly is top notch."""
5,Stay in Austin Fairmont,We went for gold experience with all day extras. It‚Äôs a bit pricier but we were staying with our two kids and it was worth it. Service was fantastic and even if the food options for kids weren‚Äôt good they ordered from downstairs resteraunts. The staff were really friendly and accommodating - with good suggestions for things to do for family. Thanks to all the staff on the gold experience on 35th floor.
4,Great hotel,Fantastic hotel. Great service. Great rooms. Great location. One thing to be aware of is on the weekend this place turns into something like spring break where locals book bedrooms to make use of the pool area not really my thing. Thank god I left as they were all arriving!
5,Awesome pool!,"This hotel is pretty new in the Austin area. Service is top notch. The pool is on the 7 th floor. Great place to have cocktail and overlook the city. The gym was great, too. It had a variety of machines, kettle bells, Tex. Everything was very clean. I would definitely stay here again!"
5,Amazing,"I really like everything about this hotel, really clean hotel, friendly staffs, the food is really good, i especially enjoined the breakfast‚Äô the room was very clean, pool is awesome, the bar, the restaurant, even the lady restroom at the lobby is amazing, great location, i will recommend it 100% to anyone, and i would definitely come again‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,Awesome hotel with awesome view,"Hotel was close to everything. It was beautiful inside and out, and bed was comfortable. Great customer service throughout whole trip. The view was amazing (we were on the 37th floor) during the day and night!"
5,Austin Fairmont,"The room was clean, the staff was friendly and professional. Room service used was timely, food choices were excellent and delicious. We had a large group for lunch on the 7th floor and my bill was incorrect. They immediately corrected it without any incident. Would stay again"
5,Amazing Stay!,The accomodations and the staff were amazing! Highly recommend staying at this Hotel! The concierge and the front desk were always amazingly helpful with the area events and venues. The hotel shuttle service was a great option to get to locations close by. A great stay overall!
5,Stunning hotel!,"Fabulous new hotel in an awesome location, beautiful room, beautiful bar, stunning pool, great food, and with a busy Keller Williams real estate convention, check in was very quick and efficient, I would totally stay there again, location was stellar!"
5,Beautiful Hote,"I made a right-hand turn from a busy, city street and upon seeing the entryway, I was instantly in a completely different world. It wasn't like the city scene melted away, it was instantly vaporized. The lobby had a beautiful ceiling framed by large trees and everyone I encountered was pleasant and helpful. I walked into my room (a corner room on the 33rd floor) and I was greeted by a panoramic view of Austin at night! It was absolutely stunning!!! The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful and pristine. The negatives were minimal, but still worth mentioning. The shower door didn't close all of the way, but it was large enough that it didn't flood the floor in use and I kept forgetting to let them know because everything else was so nice! If you choose to self-park, the garage has a near sewage-like odor that doesn't fit the hotel in the least. I'm not sure what caused it, but it was a truly awful smell. Overall it was one of the best stays I've had in a hotel and I hope to experience it again soon (minus the garage odor)!"
5,Great experience!,The staff and leadership at the Fairmont are amazing. The facility is beautiful and has a fun vibe. Everyone we interacted with was warm and friendly. We felt like we were amoung family everywhere in the hotel. The wait staff at the outlets were warm and personable. Very engaging.
5,Fairmont,I enjoyed the hotel and all the amenities. I was on business and lounged in the pool in the afternoons and it was delightful. I ate at Garrisons twice because once wasn't enough. Will definetly come back next Keller Williams Mega Camp.
5,Best Location Downtown,"Comfortable and large rooms, excellent customer service and very nice staff. The tastiest Mexican hot chocolate ever at Good Things (the hotels's sundries and gift shop). Very conveniently located adjacent to the convention center and within walking distance to some great downtown restaurants."
5,Highly Recommend,I highly recommend the Fairmont. Not only are the rooms great with the large and very comfy beds but they are very clean. This property has several restaurants to choose from and a wonderful little shop that sells the best coffee. The staff are beyond friendly and are so helpful and go out of their way to make you feel welcome.
5,absolutely amazing.,"my husband and i stayed on the 25th floor and it had a gorgeous view. the bar on the 7th floor had great wine and it‚Äôs also walking distance to rainey and downtown if you want to venture out. the staff was so helpful and kind. overall, our experience here was very enjoyable."
5,First Time at the Fairmont,"My wife and I had an excellent experience at the Fairmont! From the staff, the spa, the walkway to the Convention Center and close to Ironworks BBQ, what more do you want?Thank you for a great time in Austin!"
5,Excellent,"Excellent room, excellent amenities. I loved the large TV screen as well and the cleanliness of the room. Great location too. Right next to Rainey Street and in the center of downtown Austin. Loved the numerous bars at the hotel as well."
2,Inconsistent,"I was visiting from London with my family, I have 2 small kids, our room was not ready. Normally I don‚Äôt mind things like this but we got NO explanation, no apology and our kids were tired and restless. Deciding to be positive I did not complain. A little bit later I asked for a late checkout as one of the staff members told us Sunday‚Äôs are less busy so more than likely we can get late checkout. When I asked the night MANAGER, told me that as they had so many people to check OUT, (not check in) that it wasn‚Äôt possible. When I asked to please explain as surely if less people were checking in it would be ok. I still got a no. Then I explained I was visiting from London and he agreed for one hour? The next morning my husband asked at the front desk (he has a British accent, I don‚Äôt), they said ok! ??? I was very disappointed... hotel was average, nothing grand...."
5,Surprisingly excellent,I was not expecting such a beautiful and comfortable hotel. The service was exemplary and the restaurant and coffee shop a plus. Not much else I can say without repeating myself. I would definitely choose the Fairmont hotel again and again.
5,Bad Ass!,"Kudos to Naivi in the spa for recommending the Garrison to eat, not only was the Spa top notch and AWESOME, Jordan (Chef) and Enrique (wait staff) at the Garrison are the most awesome and nicest people I've met. The food was BAD ASSSSSSS! Jordan is a beast in the Kitchen!"
5,Great Stay at the Fairmont Hotel in Austin!,"Accommodating Staff, Beautiful Clean Hotel with all the amenities! Great restaurants, incredible pool with amazing views. It was so convenient staying at this hotel with direct access to the convention center."
3,Short Staffed,"The property is lovely and well appointed but they seemed to be short staffed across all departments. Check-in took over 45 minutes at 10PM (only 2 people working the front desk), room service was on an hour delay, poolside service was 30-40 minutes for a drink, housekeeping was still servicing rooms at 4PM, I tried calling the concierge multiple times and gave up after the line rang for 2+ minutes. Having been open a year+ it seems they still don't have a staffing model that provided the level of service expected for the quality of property and price point."
5,New Favorite Hotel in Austin,"Wow, what a great hotel!Upon check-in, I was offered a reasonably priced upgrade to the Gold floor. That was definitely worth the money. The Gold Lounge was fantastic!Cooked to order omelette in the morning, snacks over the lunch hour and light fare for the dinner hour (as well as an honor bar with hard liquor, great wine selections and beer). They also have their own check-in/check-out and concierge! The room was great as well. Nicely appointed rooms and a large walk-in shower. I opted for views of Lady Bird Lake. The views were stunning.As for the hotel grounds, everything was laid out nicely. There are two bars (one by the pool, one near the lobby), a restaurant and a coffee shop. The pool was amazing! It feels more like a Vegas or resort pool.Honestly, I can‚Äôt say anything bad about my stay! I had one noise issue but management was great about that as well.I will definitely make this Fairmont my first choice when I return to Austin."
5,Fairmont Austin,"This hotel experience was top notch. From check in to check out, we were treated extremely well and with great efficiency. No item was left undone. Meals taken in this hotel were well prepared and served with great attention to details. Our servers were well informed regarding menu choices in detail. Wait staff in conference area served quickly and correctly. My room was super clean and very well appointed.The bed was super comfortable."
5,"The Fairmont is amazing, my favorite place to stay in Austin","For years I've traveled to Austin for business and for years I've honestly been unimpressed with lodging. With the Fairmont I've finally found my hotel. There are so many small touches that added up to an overall pleasant experience. The bridge to the convention center makes it ideal if you have a conference there hands down. Additionally, the free bikes and local shuttle are convenient, the lobby is clean and modern, staff are prompt and energetic, rooms have a nice touch of modern and classic styles."
5,Brand new & great value,"My wife and I had a very relaxing and enjoyable getaway at the Fairmont in Austin. The staff was friendly, the room was large and well-appointed, and the facility was brand new and very sharp in appearance. We had a bit of a hiccup regarding the reservation, but Peter, the on-duty manager, stepped up to the plate and provided first-class service to get things resolved.We'll most definitely be back!"
4,Good,New hotel. Great views. Nice room. Location was convenient for walking to everywhere in Austin.The pool area is nice but gets very crowded on a hot afternoon. Some guests loud and obnoxiousBar area is nice
4,Thank you!,"Front desk, Concierge & other hotel staff were friendly, helpful and professional. For example: needed extra towels & they arrived within a few minutes of my call! Restaurant food was excellent and so was our service."
5,Weekend Escape,Wow. From the excellent service at check-in to the great food in Revue and the most awesome coffee @ Good Things. Our stay at the Austin Fairmont was great. Our family group aged from 8 - 90 years old and everyone had the best time. Highly recommended.
5,Best hotel in Austin,"Fantastic value. Booked with Costco travel. Beautiful room, great view, comfortable bed, great service, free parking and internet, fantastic buffet breakfast included. Great gym. Great restaurants inside the hotel. Great server named Allie...originally from New Orleans...brought us food from the menu and dessert to taste at dinner to encourage us to venture out of our comfort zone"
5,Great hotel!,"The Fairmont Austin is not only beautiful, but their customer service was exceptional! I arrived early and they didn't have a room ready for me immediately, but within an hour, they had prepared a room and notified me that it was ready. The room itself was wonderful, clean and very well-decorated. The food was also excellent. I really enjoyed my stay!"
4,Family trip,"My family had our reunion at the Fairmont Austin this year and we really enjoyed our stay. We were also celebrating a few birthdays as well. We had several rooms booked, both on the standard floor and Gold floor. As far as the quality of the rooms between the two floors seemed almost about equal. The bathroom was slightly bigger and the view was slightly better on the Gold floor but honestly both were great and I don‚Äôt think you will notice much of a difference. The Gold floor lounge was nice, service was always helpful. Thank you to Corey as he arranged a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine and birthday cake sent up to the rooms. This was great because it really made the birthday special for my family. The breakfast was amazing in the lounge, with nice cold drinks, and snacks to enjoy. If you think you will take advantage of the food throughout the day then I think the extra charge is justified. Housekeeping was wonderful, and set up a crib in one of the rooms with complimentary baby products inside of it.The only thing that was flawed in our stay was the amount of people that were at the pool area. The first day we could not get seats and had to stand up and find a corner to stuff our towels. We ended up leaving after a short time. The next day we had to get their before noon to have some chance to get a seat. It‚Äôs unfortunate to not be able to come to the pool when you feel like it because you know it will be overcrowded and may not get a chair. They also keep many of the poolside sofa areas reserved and unoccupied which is wasted space. As the other reviews stated, it almost gets to be like a Vegas pool party and less inviting for families with kids. Otherwise the pool is nice in itself.Parking was convenient at $35 for self park. Location was decent too. I would recommend as this seems to be a newer and more upscale property as compared to other hotels in the area."
5,Keller Williams Convention Accomodations,"This hotel was fabulous. The customer service they delivered was outstanding. The location of the hotel is great - it is within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The proximity to the convention center makes this my new ""go to"" for all KW events."
5,"Great Hotel, Subpar Restaurants","LOVE the hotel, I cannot say the enough. The staff makes you feel like royalty. I love the gorgeous pool and huge bar with live piano music, however the piano music can be very loud to the point of uncomfortable while trying to relax and drink with friends.The food at the restaurants on site are so-so and the restaurant by the poolside in downright rude. Seriously, look up the reviews for ""Rules and Regs"". The hotel was nice enough to make it up to me but it still left a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience.Overall, I would stay here again and I would recommend it."
5,Fantastic Hotel,"Fairmont Austin has got it going on. Perfect stay. Will definitely be back. Really enjoyed everything about the hotel. Not one negative comment to about. Products, to beds, to food, everything about our stay was fantastic."
1,Terrible,Sorry to say Austin did not take lessons from DallasIt died along time ago in Dallas already dead in Austin! What ever u do do not stay here! Out the way and staff not accommodating pool bar is a joke!Do yourself a favor bypass & make way to lots more & better options!
5,Pride weekend in Austin,"We were in Austin for Gay Pride and stayed at the new and beautiful Fairmont hotel. Everything about the hotel is very thoughtful, but we'd especially like to recognize Gold Lounge attendant Victor. He was very personable and helped us plan our time in Austin. On the night of the parade we missed dessert hour so he delivered some to our room. See the pictures below."
5,KW Mega Camp Bliss,"First class service, amenities, club room and even the bicycles were exceptional. Staff was friendly, courteous, happy, responsive and helpful. Spa services were friendly and good quality and would use again."
5,Fairmont Austin,"Impeccable service. That was all I was going to say, I am forced to fill out 200 chars, so while I will give the hotel a 5 star rating, I am giving TripAdvisor a 1 star rating, there, 200 characters.."
4,Business Trip,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel. The room and amenities were excellent. The convenience to the Convention Center was the main reason this hotel was chosen, it did not disappoint. The room was very comfortable, we slept well with no noise. The bathroom had everything we needed and had great lighting. The pool looked amazing although we did not have time to enjoy the pool."
5,Great overall stay + staff,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful city. Food was really good no matter what restaurant you ate at - our waitress Liz made the experience even better for us. Would definitely stay here again for the experience i had.
5,Impeccable Customer Service - One of the Best or The Best Hotel in Austin Texas.,"From the time the Bell Hop opens your door, you can tell that this Hotel is different from the others. The staff members are courteous, attentive, and they make you feel at home. They have a courtesy vehicle available at first come first serve, and the drivers are top-notch, and the car is clean. I would instead tip them what I would spend an Uber or Lyft. The rooms are spotless and where I was, I had the view of the Lake and poolside. A couple of staff members that stood out was Kevin McCartan, who gave me directions and insisted for me to bring a complimentary umbrella which I appreciate it because it rained. Another staff member is Monica Garcia, who gave us a tour of the Gold Lounge, and she was friendly and explained the difference of being part of the Gold Level floors. The Pool area, The View, and the Pool restaurant were terrific too! The Fulton Bar is also superb; everyone is friendly and accommodating and makes consistent drinks. Megan and an Older Gentleman with long beard were fantastic! The restaurants were excellent and the only thing is I stayed for five days, and the Breakfast buffet did not have any variation. Lots of food but the same food every day. I wish they would have offered a fusion of the Italian, American, and Asian cuisine which is served in the restaurant at lunch and dinner.Overall this Hotels provides top-notch customer service, great amenities, and clean, delicious restaurants."
5,Gorgeous Luxury Hotel Located in the Heart of it All,"From the moment I entered the hotel, the service was top-notch. I was greeted warmly at check-in, which was prompt and courteous. My room was on the 26th floor and the view was mesmerizing (especially at night)! It was well appointed with a superbly comfortable bed, luxury bath products and a stocked mini-fridge and snack center. Housekeeping was very thorough and provided nice additional touches like organizing my products on the bathroom counter neatly on a towel. The lobby bar was crowded but service was fantastic nonetheless, and didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for a drink. The pool was beautiful and had nice amenities like complimentary sunscreen and water. Definitely will be back again!"
4,Super Nice!,"I was in Austin for a conference at the downtown convention center. The Fairmont is attached by a walkway to the convention center which made this hotel very convenient. The hotel is beautiful, the staff were, without exception, extremely helpful and pleasant. Rooms are very spacious and quiet which I really appreciate. I did not eat or drink at the hotel, other than a quick breakfast so I can't comment on the food. Easy distance to a ton of dining options. The only thing I missed is a tub to soak in - hotels seem to be taking them all out these days! I would definitely stay at The Fairmont Austin again."
5,Excellent property,I will always stay at the Fairmont when attending the Keller Williams Annual convention. Its such a beautiful hotel plus the access into the convention center is very simple.The amenities are beautiful and the food is excellent.
5,Fantastic!,"Amazing views, beautiful amenities and accommodations, delicious food, incredibly polite, friendly, and responsive staff! If you are looking for a high-end hotel experience that won't break the bank this is definitely the perfect hotel."
5,Outstanding Experience!,Every single detail has been beyond any expectation we had! We were fully delighted with every aspect of our stay. It will definitely be my new go to hotel in Austin. The Gold lounge was a delightful surprise and the food was outstanding! We felt spoiled at every turn!
5,August Trip to Austin,"Lovely, clean hotel in downtown Austin. Rooms are great, lovely decor, huge bathrooms.I would have liked to see a little ""shop"" for incidentals/gifts more than the sandwich shop. Gifts for home.Restaurants were good, but may need some training for staff."
5,Best hotel anywhere.,"Unfortunately I only come to Austin one time a year. I love the staff, location, views, rooms, beds. This is one of the best hotels I stay in every year. Thank you for a wonderful stay and will see you next August"
5,Convenient and Classy Austin Hotel,"The Fairmont was awesome-beautiful throughout, excellent service at all levels, super clean and comfortable room, and the best food quality/selection of any hotel I've ever been to. I would absolutely stay here again."
3,"Beautiful room, terrible accommodations",The room and hotel were lovely but extremely over priced if having to share a bed. Especially with no warning of this change due to Fairmont running out of rooms with the double bed. Also very disappointing that there was no empathy or compensation for it. I would probably never stay at Fairmont again.
5,First Time,Fantastic hotel - great customer service- well furnished rooms and gorgeous and relaxing pool area. Very much enjoyed my stay and will be back! From check-in to check-out the hotel staff was welcoming and ready to help!
4,Luxurious but a little beaten up,"The Fairmont Austin is a bit of a puzzle. On one hand it feels new and glitzy and offers the great Fairmont service , but on the other hand the rooms and halls are already beaten up a bit. Maybe folks just party too hard there. I arrived a few hours before checkin time and the valet staff offered me an option to self park and save a few dollars. The garage was easy to access. The checking line was long but moved quickly and the staff was able to get me in a room early. The lobby and elevators had a very modern luxury vibe, but the room itself had furniture with large dents and missing pieces , and the walls in the hallway were likewise in need of some touch up. On the plus side the bed and linens were great. The only other blip was when I returned one night around midnight and I circled the garage but no parking spots were available. The valet told me they would take my car and only charge the self parking rate, so great service. I would return."
5,Worth the price,"Excellent service and beautiful facility. Worth the price to upgrade and enjoy the lovely lounge! The food is delicious and includes a full breakfast. So nice to have unlimited bottled water as well., not to mention a spectacular view of the city."
5,Love this hotel,"My husband went on a little staycation here, and I loved it! I stay in a lot of hotels (work and play), and they all start looking alike. But this one was unique and pretty. Loved the color scheme and the design overall. We went to the pool, which is beautiful. I was afraid it would be a total scene, but there was one of every shape and size there. I felt like anyone could feel comfortable and spend the afternoon having cocktails and enjoying it. The bar is pretty too. The rooms, again, are unique and so pretty - we splurged for lake view and didn't regret it! Oh and the concierge who checked us in was so kind and enjoyable to chat with. We will be back."
5,Business Conference,Hotel was a great place to hold business conference. Meeting rooms were the right size for the different events. The staff for the conference meeting rooms were professional and helpful. The staff throughout the Hotel was great.
4,Gold only if you‚Äôre looking for something over the top,"Excellent stay at the Fairmont with the Gold experience. I highly recommend the gold experience if you‚Äôre looking for something over the top and something close to ‚Äúall-inclusive. If I were not hanging around the hotel much, I wouldn‚Äôt go with gold status.The spa areas should be available to all guests, but at the Fairmont you must purchase a spa pass unless you purchase a service, especially for the price of the gold experience. The spa was pretty much empty."
5,5 star experience!,"While staying at the Fairmont, I was sitting at the bar talking with my friend, Kevin the bartender must have overheard me talking about how I left my toothpaste at home, 5 minutes later, Kevin shows up unexpectedly with toothbrush and toothpaste... Great customer experience!"
4,Summer weekend in Austin,"Compared to other Fairmont locations, the one in Austin is relatively modern and less stuffy. There are several things we liked....place was very clean, staff was helpful (especially Chris at the pool) and the casual dining options on the first floor (it's like a food hall set-up) were solid.If I'm being picky, while the fitness center is spacious and has a ton of aerobic options, they don't have any weight machines. They do have one cable machine and a bunch of free weights but if your workout is centered around the use of machines, this isn't the place for you (the JW Marriott would be).The biggest issue is the pool. It's a nice pool however it appears they sell day passes and the place fills up quickly. It's like a party pool in Vegas. If you come after 11 a.m., you are unlikely to find a chair. Fortunately, we rented a cabana. While it had a food/drink minimum, I would highly recommend it. Not only does it provide shade, it gives you guaranteed seating."
5,"Quality, service and luxury all in one hotel!",I can't say enough about our stay at the Fairmont Austin. I have been gushing about it since I got home. The staff were all so genuinely kind and accommodating. Whatever I needed they were there to help. Our room and the view were gorgeous. The bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. Everything throughout the facility was meticulously clean and kept. We dined in the restaurant which was wonderful. The rooftop bar was great. It was so hot out and were so happy to see the lounges in the pool! The location is great. We walked everywhere. Perfect! We will be back.
5,Book this hotel!,"To sum it up, this has been the BEST hotel experience I have ever had. The look of the entire hotel is clean and modern (almost like Vegas). The staff was INCREDIBLE! From opening the doors to assisting us with our bags, to explaining every inch of the room in detail. Hands down this is the place to go, don‚Äôt bother looking anywhere else. Also, there‚Äôs a rooftop pool."
3,Fairmont Austin,"Overall the property was nice, the staff was NOT. We were overcharged for our room, and have had to call several times only to have the staff be extremely rude and arguing with us because the room deposit they charged hasn't been returned to our card. Very unprofessional."
5,great!,"Hotel was beautifully designed, very clean. Loved the Le Labo products. Restaurant was actually quite good... Really enjoyed my stay. Would definitely return for another business trip. I wish there were slippers though!"
5,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at the Fairmont in Austin, TX for a convention. Check in was quick and easy. It was late in the evening so we went straight to our room on the 36th floor. The view from our room was amazing. The staff was kind and courteous, the room was well maintained, everything was very clean. The hotel is centrally located to the Convention Center, restaurants and nightlife. I would stay here again."
5,Luxury stay in Austin,Quick overnight stay in Austin. So happy to have booked a night at the afairmont. The room was spacious and comfortable. Had a delicious meal at Revue. All of the staff were helpful and accompdatimg. I would love to visot again on my next trip to Austin.
5,Best in Austin,I‚Äôve been to every high end hotel in Vegas LA NY and MIA and I must say I was impressed. The decor was flawless. The atmosphere was jaw dropping. The pool was perfect. I will be going back very soon. Thank You Fairmont
4,Austin Fairmont,Valet very disorganized and slow. Pillows and sheets are over bleached and scratchy. Very hard mattress. Housekeeping outstanding. The Garrison and other Restaurants are excellent. Floor 35 Gold lounge is superb for snacks and relaxing in a quiet area. Like being at home in my living room. Everyone is friendly and accommodating.
4,Great hotel but don‚Äôt try to use cell phone while staying here!,"Fantastic hotel! Just need to figure out how to improve cell coverage in hotel. I was there for business and could not ever find a place except outside the hotel that had cell signal. All of my colleagues had same issue. To be a place for corporate meetings, this needs to be addressed by management."
5,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Austin,"The Fairmont Austin doesn't disappoint! Lovely and luxurious hotel in the heart of Austin. Close to entertainment, dining and the lake. Rooms were spacious and nicely appointed. Beds were extremely comfortable. Great food in on-site dining options and gorgeous lounge area/bar. Pool area is the best in the city. Excellent fitness center. The Fairmont Austin is my top choice in the city!"
5,Luxurious Hotel with Friendly Staff and Lovely Views,"I travel to Austin routinely for business and pleasure. This was a work trip and it was everything I needed. The valet parking was easy, reception was smooth, and the room was wonderful. The Hotel is new and attractive. There are multiple restaurants and a bar with lots of friend bartenders and other guests. The room was right next to the elevator on the 18th floor so I was concerned about noise but it was quiet all night. The room had everything you need. The bed was a bit on the firm side for me, but I tend to like a ""Princess & The Pea"" soft comfy mattress. I'll definitely return."
5,Voodoo Dave trip,We stayed at the outstanding Fairmont Austin for 4 nights on a family trip. The hotel was over run with a convention however we still managed to get sat around the pool and squeezed in the dining area.
5,Fairmont Austin is a fine hotel,"I often stay at the Fairmont Austin when I‚Äôm traveling there on business. The staff, the rooms, the bars, and the restaurants are all top notch. I feel well cared for from the moment I arrive until the moment I depart."
5,GREAT SERVICE!,"I recently ate at the revue and it was wonderful! Great food and delicious drinks, all made better by the exceptional service of our server Liz. She was so knowledgeable and friendly that I can‚Äôt wait to come back."
5,Relaxing,"We had a week long stay here for a conference. The staff is kind and take pride in their hotel. The hotel is beautiful! We did have to call to have our room serviced almost everyday, but the amount of guests from our company probably overwhelmed them a bit so other than that, we had a great experience."
5,Great Hotel,Excellant Destination and great location. Wish there were mini refrigerators in each room. The Pool area is amazing.Definitely worth the stay. Neat Hotel right near Sixth Street and Rainey Street. Close to IHop Austin.
5,"Amazing, enough said!","My wife and I celebrated our 15 year anniversary and decided to get away for a few nights at Austin and read many reviews before we decided on the Fremont. Our trip started off to a very rocky start as the airline lost our luggage, worse feeling ever when you travel. The condition of the hotel, amenities, rooms and staff were amazing. We checked in on a Wednesday and soon found out there was a big convention in town so we decided to upgraded to Fremont Gold and it was the best decision we could have done. Not only was breakfast and snacks included throughout the day but the friendliness staff we have ever come across. Dave gave us great recommendations on things to do and Jose was very attentive and accommodating, talk about attention to detail, they truly made us feel like family. When we were getting ready to go down stairs to the pool we found out fairly quickly that we had forgot our sunblock, no need to fear because the hotel provided some for everyone as soon as you walk into the pool entrance. It was within walking distance to everything worth seeing and doing in downtown. We had the best relaxing vacation, we were rejuvenated and felt like we took our marriage to another level. Thank you again Fremont!!!"
1,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful new, clean hotel with great gym and spa facilities. Unfortunately, the outdoor bar/ lounge was open til 1am both nights of my stay and the noise disrupted my sleep. Not ideal for business travel."
5,Amazing Hotel,"This is one of the most chic Hotels I've stayed in Austin. The level of Hospitality is Amazing. The decor, The Rooms, just everything about this Hotel is worth giving it a try! The Restaurants, The Bars, The Pool, The entire ambiance was spectacular. A must do if you are visiting Austin."
5,Conference ready,Excellent destination and great location. Wish there were mini refrigerator and microwave in each room but they brought us one during our stay. The pool and area around the pool was amazing. Definitely worth the stay to enjoy the pool.
5,Great location!,"Fairmont Austin is in the heart of everything. It is within walking distance from the infamous Rainey Street and 6th Street. The pool is amazing as well. Also, a shoutout Robert from concierge was very helpful by providing my friends and I with many restaurant suggestions and places to go kayaking/paddle boarding. His service was top notch, we really appreciated his kindness and for taking the time to give us a run down of the city."
5,My stay at the Fairmont Austin,The Fairmont Austin is a beautiful property. The people and the service were first rate.The food was very good at every event thatI attended. My room was spacious and verycomfortable. I look forward to my next stayat the Fairmont Austin.
5,Business Trip Stay,"I was in town for Scentsy Family Reunion and chose this location because it was so close to the convention center. Everyone was helpful, from check-in to check-out. The front desk and bell hops gave great advice on restaurant's too."
5,Incredible Hotel,"The Fairmont in Austin is an amazing hotel. It is beautiful throughout and elegance abounds everywhere. Top line everything pleases the most sophisticated traveler. It is expensive, but for a luxury hotel, worth the money. Beautiful room appointments, luxurious towels. Everything is top notch."
5,Excellent Business Stay,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont in Austin for two nights on business. The hotel property is outstanding. The grounds and common areas are beautiful and well maintained. There are several restaurants to choose from on the ground floor and everything is very functional and comfortable.Check in was very quick and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I was off to my room quickly.The room was outstanding. I had a king room and it was very spacious, comfortable and functional. Everything was very clean, the bed was wonderful and the climate control was very cool which is good on a 104 degree day. My only call out was water pressure in the shower which was pretty weak but just nit picking at this point.I had room service twice, the selection was awesome which usually isnt the case with room service. Service was fast and the food was fantastic.Everything about the hotel and the stay was wonderful. From the staff, to the amazing lobby to the comfortable room, I would easily return."
5,Best Part of Our Trip,"Staying at the Fairmont was the best part of our Austin vacation. We have never stayed at a better hotel and that would include the Broadmoor, Wynn and Phoenician, among others. Great location. Big rooms. Very clean. Quiet. And an amazing, wonderful staff. It's great."
5,AMAZING,Spent the weekend in Austin and could not have selected a better hotel. Everything was perfect. Beautiful room with a fantastic view. Excellent customer service Roger at the front desk made you feel very welcomed. Breakfast buffet soooo many choices.
5,Beautiful Hotel!,Great Stay and Excellent service! Pool area is gorgeous and the location of the hotel is near great food and fun things to do. Hotel staff is very professional and I have never had a hotel room left as tidy as ours!
5,Excellent Experience!,"This hotel is beautiful. The lobby creates an experience in itself. I came here for a corporate meeting and everything from the guest rooms, the staff and the meeting spaces were very upscale. I would recommend to anyone looking to host a meeting in the Austin area!"
5,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff","The Fairmont Austin is a beautiful hotel. The pedestrian walkway on level 2 made it easy and safe to get to the convention center.The nachos from room service were so good, but I was surprised to see a $5 delivery charge included on my bill."
5,Amazing,"This hotel is top notch. We could only afford to spend one night there, but it was totally worth it for our 2nd anniversary. We splurged and went for the gold experience.... Yes yes yes! There were snacks and drinks we could take to the room or by the pool. The breakfast had omlette to order. The stay was fantastic!! Would definitely recommend for the couples"
5,Nice hotel,The hotel is very new. But the poor is quite crowd and not good for kids. Seems this hotel is not family friendly.. But good for adults. The food and service are good. Location is good. I think the hotel management team need to think about what kind of clients they want to target.
2,Not a good hotel to relax by the pool on the weekend,"The pool is behind a guarded, locked gate. The bar and the bathrooms are OUTSIDE of the locked gate, which made it difficult to get a drink or use the restroom. There was no wait service for drinks inside the locked gate. We asked 4 servers if we could order a drink. All said no. They said ""no, I only serve the cabanas"" or ""I'll send someone over"" (and they never did). All we wanted to do was have a nice day by the pool and give away our money, but we were not able to. Why are the bars behind gates and not by the pool? Why are the bathrooms outside of the pool area? Most bikinis don't have pockets for hotel keys to get in and out of the gate. Needed more servers by the pool."
5,Just the Right Hotel!,"My review about this place is 5 stars, service, the manger, the upgraded room to king deluxe corner room with half the room covered in windows from the floor to the ceiling. Here for my friends pre-wedding shin-dig, bachelors not calling it what it is lol, anyway get together and we stayed August 2nd, 2019. The pool Amazing, music, palm trees, bar drinks, great company around the pool, free sunblock. Back to the room (I want a room like this all the time, (king bed, wood desk, new designer carpet, TV stand with build in dresser, and bar fridge, sitting chair, walk-in shower) Great lay out design! Had some friends come over (5), fit all of us no problem relaxing before we headed out. Thanks Fairmount I will be back!"
5,Very nice hotel,"The Fairmont is an excellent hotel. Starting with the entrance, it even smells lovely. Good restaurant and room service options. The spa is wonderful. Fitness center well equipped with full size equipment. Pools were great to cool down in the hot Austin sun. Rooms were clean and updated with great views of the city. Central location. Customer service was great too, accommodating staff."
5,Great stay at the Fairmont,Everything about the Fairmont was top notch. The checkin was easy and quick. Room was beautiful. Pool was fantastic. The hotel is convenient to downtown and many of the clubs and restaurants. I would consider it one of the best values for a hotel of it's caliber.
5,What a great Hotel,"This hotel is in a great location in downtown Austin within walking distance to everything. The lobby bar has live music every night. The hotel pool is outside on the 7th floor of the hotel. There are 2 huge pools with benches, fountains, and lounge chairs in the pools. There are comfy cabanas and plenty of lounge chairs, tables and umbrellas surrounding the pool. Also a great hot tub. There is a bar and food service, and an area with corn hole and other games on artificial turf. There are big screen TVs and music playing. The beautiful Austin skyline is a great back drop to it all. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is very accommodating to its guests. The room was great and the shower was divine."
5,Wonderful staff and beautiful property,"I loved good things coffee shop, the baristas Lee, Demetra and Ashley took care of me every morning as I would bring my beautiful wife coffee everyday as she was at her confrence. They were so happy and friendly. I highly recommend staying at this property, and locals theh have Sunday brunch with all you can eat, and $3.00 mimosas!"
3,"Nice Property - need attention to detail in housekeeping, poor bar service","I stayed at the Fairmont in late June for an annual conference (also stayed the same week in 2018). The room and hotel are very nice. Check-in was smooth. Our dining experience at Revue was great, and service provided by Bryan G was spectacular and on point with Fairmont brand and quality. He really made our party feels special.I did have a couple of issues:1 - when my room was cleaned on the morning after my first night, ALL toiletries were removed from the room and none were replaced. When I awoke and prepared to shower, there was no soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, etc. I don't think this is acceptable for a Fairmont brand (or any brand) of hotel. I called guest services and they sent up more toiletries, but this delayed my ability to make my meeting on time.2 - Service at the lobby bar, Fulton, was spotty, at best. And our server one afternoon, Sam, overcharged me on my bill. We ordered one Topo Chico ($5), and 3 appeared on our bill. When I questioned the bill, Sam said ""oh yeah, I had to enter another one since the first was never delivered."" She left and returned with a new bill, with 2 Topo Chicos. I advised her that we only had on, and she argued with me and told me that one of my party had ordered one Topo Chico just when we sat down (she did not - my guest wasn't even there when Sam first approached us). We sat down before Sam came to work, and Sam transferred our initial check from the bar to the tables, so the accusation was completely invalid. I ended up paying for the extra Topo Chico because I really didn't want to continue arguing with Sam, but to be honest, good customer service would have had Sam removing it from the bill and not continuing to argue with the customer.I received an email asking me to write a review of my stay on TripAdvisor, to which I responded that I was happy to write a review, but it would not be positive, so I'd like to give management an opportunity to hear my feedback first. I did not hear from the hotel, just a reminder email to post my review, thus this review.Incidentally, I had a different issue with housekeeping in 2018, which took me three times attempting to contact hotel management before my issue was acknowledged and addressed."
5,Fairmont is Outstanding!,"I stayed at the Fairmont for a three day weekend. I must say my stay there was nothing less than superb! From the moment I entered the Hotel, to the front desk & the restaurants inside, I received wonderful service. My room was beautiful, the decor, bedding & view were nice! I can be finicky when sleeping in another bed outside my own but I slept like a baby (not sure if it was a heavenly mattress but felt like it). I have stayed at some nice hotels & this was one of my best experiences."
4,Beautiful Resort,"my husband and I came here for four days and loved the hotel! It is modern, beautiful and has great amenities! We loved the roof top pool. There was a very large conference while we were here and unfortunately it made it difficult to get up and down from our room because we had to wait a really long time for elevators and many that came by were full. Also, there was a lot of shouting in the mornings from the large groups staying there who we‚Äôre heading out to the conference. On Saturday night there was a huge line for the elevators that was hardly moving and about 30 minutes or more long for the elevator. we asked a staff member if we could take the stairs but were informed there was not really a good way to get up by stairs so he took us to the lounge and offered to cover our drinks which was really kind and much appreciated! Unfortunately when we were at Fulton‚Äôs the service was really terrible, we waited a long time for someone to even notice us at our table and the service was very slow. They seemed understaffed and maybe a bit disorganized.On our first day we had requested a mini fridge but none were available due to how full our hotel was but as soon as one became available they put it in our room while we were out which was much appreciated!I had messaged the hotel before our stay and told them it was my husbands birthday and asked if there was anything I could pay for or arrange for that but nobody ever got back to me which was a bit disappointing. However, overall we had a great stay and would come back (as long as there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a massive conference!)"
5,"Beautiful, top notch hotel","We came to Austin for the weekend and wanted to treat our party of 4 to a deluxe night! The Fairmont didn't disappoint. Beautiful hotel, brand new. Built in 2018. Super clean and top notch. From check in the check out we didn't encounter a single problem.One person who stuck out to us was Rene Valdez, who helped us get our bags from car to our room. Then, he took the time to show us all the room amenities! His joy for life and helping people shines brightly and was noticed by all of my party. Rene Valdez is a true asset to the Fairmont!!One tip: Parking isn't cheap. $45 a night for valet."
1,Never again,My husband and I stayed here on a Wednesday night. $190.00 for the room but $150.00 for my 5 lb dog. My dog should have had his own room. Not to mention the LONG line at the elevator to get to my room....30 minuets later we made to the 18th floor. Luxury prices without luxury service. I think they are getting by on the old reputation of the Fairmont Hotels. We‚Äôll head back over to the Hyatt Regency where they are actually pet friendly and people friendly.
5,Perfect Place to stay,"I have no complaints. The room was excellent, brunch is amazing, pool is amazing. Perfect location.I would like to stay here for my next trip to Austin. The Fairmont is not the lowest priced hotel in the area, but it is definitely worth the extra money."
4,"Beautifully appointed, luxurious quality, with Southern hospitality!","Th entire staff is incredibly focused on customer service. Buildings may be beautiful, views outstanding, but the people, their friendliness, and promises kept are far more important. We will be back!"
5,Jen Masino,Ni in the Spa nail salon was awesome and gave me the best manicure / pedicure I‚Äôve ever had! The hotel was beautiful and the spa staff was wonderful! I‚Äôll be sure to book an appointment with Ni when I return.
5,Very nice property with excellent service,"All staff I encountered were well trained, courteous and professional. The valet employees make a nice first impression of this hotel. Front desk staff were efficient and very helpful. Property is very nice, current, and easy to get around in. Will definitely be back!"
5,Great Service at Garrison,"We stayed at the Fairmont for 4 days. The food and drinks at the Garrisons was great. Our bartender Kyle was an awesome person. Kyle was very attentive, on point with our orders and friendly. Great ambiance."
5,Road Trip 2019,"I really like this hotel, this was my second time staying here. It has a great location, right down from Rainey St and Congress bridge. I love the coffee at Good Things. We had a great view of the pool, Rainey and the river. The rooms are very nice and clean. The pool area is a bit small, but very nice, and it is hard to get bar service unless you have a big group. There is a a walk up bar so you don‚Äôt have to wait for a server, that took some time as well but they were nice an apologetic for the wait."
5,Nothing weird about this stay,Hotel was absolutely beautiful.. we enjoyed the five star experience that we received. The pool was amazing. Was able to combine business and pleasure both that made this stay feel like all pleasure. If returning to Texas I will definitely myself return as well as recommend family and friends to do so. Thank you for a most relaxing wonderful experience. Love your coffee shop. My drink of choice was better than Starbucks shhh lol üòÇ
5,Fairmont all good with me!,"Great hotel, close proximity to many events and conference. Great staff and concierge - always helpful and over the top friendly! Nice bar and restaurants and rooms were spacious! Very pleased with my stay. I appreciate your hospitality!"
5,EXCELLENT HOTEL WITH EXCELLENT SERVICE,I throughly enjoyed my stay at the Fairmont Austin. The rooms were beautiful and tastfully decorated. The staff seemed very accomodating. One morning they forgot my cream for coffee and they brought it up within 10 minutes. My only complaint would be the parking charge of 45.00 a day.
5,Perfect for Conferences!,"We stayed here for a work conference and I would definitely recommend. Not only is the hotel beautiful but there are many conference rooms available to suit your needs. The staff was amazing. So friendly and made sure our water, snacks, etc were constantly replenished. I saw the ladies room cleaned several times while there. Who doesn't love a clean bathroom?! The bar area upstairs has a beautiful view. I hope to enjoy the pool next time."
5,Great Stay,Very clean and modern. Staff was beyond friendly. We really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommend this hotel if your traveling for business or treating your self to an Austin getaway Can‚Äôt think of anything negative to say about this place. Pool is great. Food is great.
4,On Business from the UK,"Stayed at the hotel for business - attending a conference at the convention centre. A beautiful hotel - but why is there no free WiFi in the rooms. apparently if you join their loyalty scheme/club on arrival this does give you access - however I was too tired to process this information on arrival. It should be free and available with no fuss! I did find my phone and data signal struggled on my room, connection improved when I went to then convention centre next door.Room was immaculate and spacious. The staff were friendly. The pool was clean and tidy. The pool was very busy at the weekend but was empty mid week!Didn‚Äôt eat breakfast in the hotel as I though it was very expensive."
5,Beautiful Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay here. Decor and details of hotel were beautiful. Room was nice, and rooftop pool was nice but just very crowded on a Sat in July. Nice food options downstairs. Nice rooftop bar to enjoy at night. Would stay here again."
5,Great place to stay!,"I found this hotel to be very comfortable. The amenities were very nice, the bed was plush and soft and the rooms are very spacious. The view I had of the river was also very nice. This hotel is in a great location downtown. Convenient to the convention center, businesses and restaurants. I would absolutely choose this hotel again if I'm in Austin."
5,SFR 2019,"We were greeted with a very helpful gentleman by the name of Diego. He has the best customer service I have ever seen in a long time in the younger generation. He was very courteous and helpful in letting us know about things to do and places to eat around Austin. This gentleman is a very good worker and seems to really care about his job. He made sure that we were taken care of with our luggage, met us at the car, waited until we got our room and then took our luggage to the room and unloaded. He made sure that we knew everything about the items in our bar and room. Very good customer aervice!!! Diego deserves a raise!!! Keep upThe great job Diego!!!"
5,Business Trip,"Great place to stay with several restaurants and lounges for ""networking."" Centrally located within walking distance to several local businesses. The entire establishment is top notch. Clean, new, and fun."
5,Beautiful property and incredible staff!,"I can't say enough about how incredible the staff is at this hotel. It has been a long time since we have felt so welcomed and well cared for. The property is gorgeous with a fantastic pool, luxuriously plush and sparkling clean rooms and excellent food. Big shout out to Alan Neiman and his Rules and Regs team for making my birthday extra special. This is our go-to hotel for ourselves and our out of town visitors."
5,Gorgeous hotel,"Beautiful hotel with the kindest and most authentic staff. Lots of great amenities - lush bathrobes in room, two beautiful roof-top pools, large hot tub, complementary car service within downtown, nice selection of tea and coffee in the room. Very responsive and quick service if anything is needed. All with a welcoming, attentive, professional, and simultaneously, down-to-earth staff - from the concierge to the bellmen to the cleaning crew to the car service staff. Made me feel great to be spending my time and my money with a company that clearly values their people, as seen in the friendly and kind nature of everyone we encountered during our week stay."
5,Great time,"The rooms are big and comfortable. We loved the pool and gym and the services was outstanding. Food was a little pricey, but what do you expect from a high end hotel in down town Austin. Be sure to take home all the soaps and shampoos as they are incredible."
4,Gorgeous Hotel,We stayed at the Fairmont during the ACL festival in 2018. 3 nights. The rooms were amazing. Roomy & comfortable. The bed was dreamy. Had the best sleep. The bar was out of this world. Great mixologist. Although it was a bit on the overpriced side...the service more than made up for it. The housekeeping service left everything pristine day after day. Very pleased with my stay.
5,Fine lodging in Austn,"From being greeted with a refreshment at check-in, through prompt and friendly staff, to a well appointed clean and comfortable room, the entire stay was fantastic. The location was perfect too, within walking distance to many of Austin's attractions."
