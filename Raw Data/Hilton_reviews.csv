5,Welcoming and Gracious Staff,"Our stay in Austin at the Hilton was enhanced by the warm and receptive staff who helped us with all our requests. They are positive and jovial, setting a great tone for guests. Special thanks to Christopher who greeted us every morning with a smile and great knowledge about Austin."
5,Great Location. Great Staff.,"Shortly after checking in I was contacted via text by staff (Kittana) asking how my experience was so far and did I need anything. These text's came periodically asking if I needed anything and suggesting helpful ideas. When I needed a late check out I simply texted back and Kittana, Kimberly and Juan all took care of it for me and suggested I could easily do an express late check out by sending a text when I was leaving the room. Everyone was extremely helpful and sincere. The hotel is in a great location downtown close to all kinds of restaurants and the workout room and pool (with a pool bar) on the 8th floor were great to work out or lounge out. It's an outside pool. Overall a great experience and I would recommend it as an Austin hotel destination."
5,Revisiting Austin,"Okay folks. If you have never been to Austin and looking for a hotel, this is your hotel. Updated, clean, great staff. Excellent location. My hats off to Kendell, Garrett and of course Ms. Lisa in the executive lounge. These are outstanding hotel staff members!!! It was great being back after 4 years. Thank you staff for all you did making my stay perfect. If you stay here you will not be disappointed."
4,"Excellent Location, clean hotel","Great location. Nice rooms, very comfortable. Starbucks off the lobby! Lights, thermostat controlled via bedside device. Plenty of TV and PPV options. Just a block off Sixth Street and a few blocks from UT."
5,Best hotel in Austin for Conference,"From the arrival to the departure, this hotel was the perfect place to host a conference. The location is in perfect proximity to local restaurants, venues, and Rainey Street. The highlight of my trip was meeting the security officer Christopher S. My colleague left a bunch of things in her room before flying home. I checked in with Chris and explained to them what items we left (very descriptive) and he was able to get them for us. Polite and super helpful! Many thanks, Chris!"
3,Forced to downgrade,I was mostly upset that I had booked an executive room and when I arrived for check in at 4:00pm I was told my room wouldn‚Äôt be available for 45 more minutes. I had an event at 5 and needed to get ready so this wasn‚Äôt an option. I was forced to downgrade rooms. The check in time was supposed to be 3. I thought it was very unprofessional for a hotel of this quality to have to downgrade me because of its poor planing.
3,Our stay at the Hilton Austin,Disappointed not very clean toilet overflowed way over priced no one told us how to use the self parking will not stay again or recommended no one even offers anything to us when I told them about the toilet
3,"Nice physical property, not well managed","Stayed for a conference and while the physical plant is great, the overall experience was not as good as the Hampton Inn (a lower cost Hilton brand) I had stayed at earlier. I had about five issues over five days and while each time the staff offered comps to make me feel better about the cold shower, lack of service in the executive lounge, or incessant bings announcing a digital key over several days, I would have much preferred a smoothly performing property to the series of small comps."
2,Bit by bug in room,"Checked into hotel on Wednesday 11/13/19. Took a nap as I had had an early flight. Was awakened in the middle of my nap by a bite on my leg. Couldn't find anything in the bed but my ankle started swelling up and getting red. Ended up having to go to urgent care and be started on an antibiotic. Told the front desk about it and they sent up ice packs, but haven't even offered to comp me one night of my stay. Ridiculous! I expect better from the Hilton."
5,Best hotel room for a gym enthusiast,"During a work trip to Austin, our team booked a weekend hotel stay at the Hilton in Austin. The location of the hotel was great as it was walking distance to downtown and to the many restaurants Austin has to offer.The best part of my stay at the Hilton was the room which they offered me as it came with it's very own personal gym. As someone who doesn't like to skip on her workout this was perfect for me. The gym in the room had a spinning bike, wall balls, resistance bands, weights, trx and more. It also offers a system which can suggest different types of workouts such as boxing, yoga or HIIT. I truly enjoyed my stay in this room and also being able to workout at my own convenience just a few steps away from my bed.A big thank you to Garett who checked me in that night (2 november) and offered me this room when all i had asked if the hotel had a gym onsite. He was great and really helpful.Thank you for making my stay at your hotel memorable!"
2,Executive lounge and front desk service downgraded,"I stayed at this hotel 2 or 3rd time. I noticed the Hilton Austin front desk service quality is not great and lounge are getting worse and running down. We witnessed scandal dispute between hotel front desk and FFTP program guest who attempted to clear situation to check in. The front desk rep Jeremy and his team were not friendly and their team is unfriendly unfair with FFTP guests which employees of the hilton booked for own family members to stay. These front desk reps created problems and caused stir in public. We feel bad and sorry for FFTP guests. Front desk reps are arrogant and cynical. By the way, Hilton Executive Lounge is running down. Its located on 25th floor. The lounge offers limited snacks and coffee/espresso machine is broken. No coffee at morning and during daytime. Breakfast taco are lousy and very limited at breakfast. No eggs and no hot breakfast at current time. In past they offered best options and their current lounge menu is downgraded. Wine/beers are for sale and not free. Better to go to Embassy Suites or another hotel for free happy hour with complimentary wine and beer drinks. Therefore, Hilton Austin is on way to downgrade someday. Be honest with you."
5,Bad stay at the Wyndham & then Hilton turned my Austin trip around,"After having the my all time worst experience EVER at the Wyndham around the corner, my stay at the Hilton literally made it so that I will come back to see Austin again. It's been a while since I had an upgrade in the states and I got used to getting them overseas, then not only did they allow me to check-in early but was even given an upgrade. They didn't even know about my bad stay at the Wyndham but made me realize I just have to stick with the Hiltons. Kihona at the front desk was so friendly and such a sweetheart I felt like I was back with family and ready to not just work in the town but enjoy some of its beauty after all. THANKS HILTON"
1,Don't Stay On The Wrong Side Of This Hotel,"This hotel knows that there is a big noise problem because of a music venue next to it, yet they took money from me for it and did not tell me about it. I dealt with it the first night, but when I offered to switch rooms the second night, they said there was nothing available. Then asked for credit for one nigh and got a fan instead. Nice. It's good that there are many other hotel options in downtown Austin."
5,"Neighborhood not for us, but hotel was great","We didn‚Äôt know which neighborhood to stay in, so opted to be downtown...First night, looking for a quiet dinner - walking past hawker after hawker down 6th street.. we were actually warned that the bar scene starts at 9 pm.Not for us quiet seekers.The hotel was lovely, but we ended up taking scooters or taxis everywhere we visited.Our room was spacious and on the executive level.We were upgraded to a corner room, so it was a bit larger than our initial selection.The club lounge was very well stocked and well attended, and is a nice option if you don‚Äôt want to dine out for every meal.Great spa experience for a pedicure."
5,Daughter‚Äôs Birthday Trip,"My daughter turned 13, so we took a trip to spend quality time together with just the two of us. We saw a concert at the Toyota center, and it was walking distance from the Hilton Austin, we felt very comfortable there, There is a Starbucks and a restaurant inside. We had a great time."
5,Amazing service üëèüèª,Our bartender was LeeAnne. she was fantastic! Really excellent at developing a customer relationship.We enjoyed delicious food and sumptuous cocktails. I really appreciated the recommendations we were given.
5,great hotel,"stayed in September for the LSU/ UT game, great staff, great accommodations! beautiful lobby, great valet service, club access was really nice. Would definitely stay here again, easy walk to most places."
5,Always Amazing Experiences,"We had another fantastic stay at the Hilton Austin. We were in town again for the Austin City Limits Music Festival, and had an experience at the Hilton that demonstrates the amazing hospitality from this hotel.I collect lapel pins from my travels, and had several displayed on a denim vest that I wear to the music festival. We were having breakfast in the executive lounge one morning, and Jordan, who manages the lounge, struck up a conversation about my vest. He was a really friendly guy, and we talked about the different pins and patches with which I'd adorned the vest.Jordan disappeared for a few minutes, and when he came back he presented me with a very special limited-edition employees-only Hilton pin. It was such a cool and thoughtful gesture, and I proudly pinned it to my vest and wore it to the festival.This kind of personal connection from the Hilton employees really sets Hilton apart in the hotel industry. It's why I love Hilton and why I keep coming back. The Hilton Austin hotel, in particular, seems to excel in making these personal connections with their guests. I highly recommend this hotel for the great experiences we've had here."
4,Great hotel,"I had a fantastic stay at the Hilton.Staff was super friendly and helpful, when needed.Lounge on the 25th floor was nice for breakfast (more for convenience, food was OK at best).Both bars/restaurants were nice. I preferred the lobby bar to the taco place in the basement. But that is just my opinion.Great location, and rate was fair. My room was always clean and I slept well(no outside noise).Super freindly staff."
4,Great Stay,Great stay here in this huge hotel. The reception/bars area are perfect for the hotel and staff all seemed very friendly. Rooms spacious and kept clean. Pool area was great but let down by the bar being shut despite the pool area being packed and weather very hot. It ended up costing the hotel as it seemed everyone just ended bringing their own.
4,Amazing property!,Great location!The hotel is conveniently located downtown and a short walk to multiple attractions.The room was very clean with an amazing view.The restaurant at the hotel had great food and added some local flair to some of their dishes.
4,"Lots of issues, but they‚Äôre quick to fix them","This hotel is great with all service staff being very personable and wanting to help! That being said, we experienced a few issues like not being given the room that I reserved initially. But they were quick to fix it. They also charged me $41 for valet for every day I was there. We didn‚Äôt even have a car...so that was weird...but they took off the charges quickly!"
3,Nice hotel...disappointing executive lounge.,"Nice hotel, nice rooms... but since when do you have to pay for drinks in an exec lounge!!!!! Not on Hilton. Apart from that it's fine. The hotel is not cheap, you'll definitely find better value in the city"
1,No room!!!,"We arrived at the hotel 8pm to check in after a long drive from Dallas, was looking forward to rest , the room was reserved 2 month earlier through British Airways and was paid for.They said they had no room, they wanted to place us in a room with bed sofas, we refused to accept, then they relocated us to a much inferior hotel compared to the one we had booked. Security was around us while discussing to intimidate!!Completely unacceptable way of handling the situation by Hilton in my view. At least they could have informed us prior to check in!When we received the room at the sister hotel, went to bed 3 hours later we heard a laud noise in the back ground that was coming from above,we were placed underneath an engine room! needless to say that our attempt to change the room was not successful.And I was told that I had an attitude! at midnight, just trying to sleep!"
5,Great Stay!!,"Overall Fantastic! Great Staff,excellent food and libations.I had a 5 day business stay and was very well taken care of for anything And everything I Needed.Definitely recommend a stat at this Hotel Anytime!"
4,Great hotel,This is a good hotel in downtown Austin. Next to the convention centre with direct access to the centre.Rooms are spacious and comfortable.Free coffe/tea ambities.Staff at frontdesk is very helpfull and customer oriented.
4,Great location,"We stayed at the Hilton for two nights. We were drawn to the property primarily for location as we had intentions to visit Sixth Street, and were very pleased. It is a great location for downtown - Sixth, Capitol, Congress Ave Bridge, etc. are all a comfortable walking distance.Property was well-kept, our room was clean and spacious, and guest services took good care of us. I frequented the hot tub and pool area, which were always clean. Elevator requires room key after a certain hour for added security.Parking can be a bit trickier. Self-park is $32 nightly while valet is $41. There are private lots around the area but we did not really research them. We paid for valet, which was fine until it came to check-out... with everyone checking out at the same time (and the added congestion from construction in the area) we had a 20 minute wait for our vehicle on checkout. We could not ‚Äúpre-order‚Äù our vehicle as they will only bring the car around once you are downstairs to request.Overall we were satisfied with our stay. I would not call it luxury accommodations, but it was a great stay in a convenient location and we would return."
3,Average place,"was there for a conference and stayed at the Hilton Austinfor the price of the room, i would have wish better quality of room.i was on the 22nd floor, great view of the state capitol. room was roomy but looks dated. Shared door is great but not good for single room traveler, can hear the people from the other room. definitely need a new facelift."
5,Perfectly Placed Hotel,"With all the hotels in Austin to choose from it can be tough choice. I often stay at Hilton Downtown Austin as it‚Äôs in the middle of it all. 6th Street is a quick walk, The East Side is a fast Uber, South Congress is walkable and you‚Äôre close to the river. The rooms have great views and it feels like they are always upgrading the place. Would recommend staying here if you want to be downtown."
1,Why is there no zero star rating? The service is just terrible,"The location is the only value of this place. If you are going to the Convention Center this is the most convenient hotel to stay in. I recommend you look at some of the others nearby instead.The room is not well designed for a business traveler. There isn't even a reasonable space to work on your laptop.But what really ticked me off was the terrible service, combined with billing errors and the flat out in-hospitable attitude of several staff members.Oh, I should point out that I'm a Hilton Diamond member, so someone the staff allegedly should be most interested in treating well. I shudder to think how a ""regular"" customer might be treated."
5,Right at the airport,Couldn't be more convenient then right at the airport with a shuttle every 20 minutes. If hotel food is not your thing grab a bite at the Mexican restaurant across the street. Otherwise the ATX burger was great. Either way you can't go wrong. Big minus was no concierge lounge major bummer for a Hilton property.
5,Best pet friendly hotel in Austin,Location is great! Perfectly in the center of the city. I bring my two dogs when I stay and they are always welcome. This is a BEAUTIFUL newly renovated hotel. Food quality and service is phenomenal and the Front Desk staff is always so friendly and helpful. I enjoy every time I come to the Hilton Austin and will continue returning.
5,Friendliest Hilton in the System,I travel sixteen days a month and this is one of the best managed hotels in the Hilton chain. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It's located in the heart of the city so it is easily accessible to both the convention center and entertainment. I often enjoy the gourmet taco bar when I visit.
5,Excellent Service,"Visited Austin for the first time and stayed at the Hilton. Nice hotel and location but what stood out the most was the great support we received upon arrival. After arriving exhausted, due to various travel related issues, we found that our room was not yet ready. We really appreciated the personal assistance we received from Robert and all the effort that was made to help us get comfortable under some frustrating circumstances. It meant a lot and was a great reflection on the Hilton. üëç"
5,Great hotel,"Great location, and comfy, quiet rooms. Highly recommended. I was allowed to check in early, and even given a late check out. I slept comfortably and felt like a valued customer. Friendly and very helpful staff."
3,"Good Location, That's All","Stayed here for a week while attending a conference at the Austin Convention Center that is right across the street, there is a pedestrian bridge connecting the two. It's also a block away from 6th street so it is well located in Austin. The hotel lobby is a huge open space, but with the lobby bar to the right as soon as you walk in the lobby does get quite loud at night.The hallways and rooms were clean and well taken care of. I had an issue with Housekeeping not coming one day, it was 5pm already, I had to contact the front desk and they kept saying they would send them up again, and didn't seem to understand that housekeeping never came that day! In the end they cleaned the room and replaced towels and etc.Other than the location close to 6th street and the convention center there is really nothing special about this hotel."
4,Business conference travel,"Overall the Hilton Austin is an excellent choice for a conference. The best quality was the hotel room itself--both lay out and size which was a pleasant find after other recent trips. There was plenty of room for storing a week's worth of clothes in the closet and drawers. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The rooms had complete sound isolation, never heard anything. The climate controls worked without any problems. There were plenty of outlets and multiple ways to control the lighting. A comfortable chair, a table/desk, and a couch (which would sleep a child to small adult if needed) were in the room. The bathroom was super clean, and well ventilated. The shower nozzle was better than average. The free level of WiFi in the room worked perfectly. I do not watch much TV and did not use the one in the room.The hotel staff were helpful, courteous, and professional. They kindly let me check out late as my meeting on the last day ran past the usual check out time. Also, as the conference completed and hundreds of people were arranging rides, the hotel staff did a great job coordinating the car traffic at their entrance---turning a potential chaotic time wasting scene into an efficient operation. The conference rooms where well thought out, not overcrowded, and usable other than WiFi problems.On the could be improved front would be the WiFi in the conference rooms--many complaints it was not usable but at least cell phone reception was good. The restaurants had some issues. I visited both once, eating only at one. My first stop was the taco oriented restaurant. It appeared to be light to moderately busy but had only one waitress working though. I left after about 25 minutes of not being served. I then went to the other restaurant which is at a higher price point. That too appeared to be staffed by just one waitress who was working very hard to keep up. I did not have any problems regarding service and had an excellent dinner (best pork chops I have ever had) and the cocktails there (the Autumn Old Fashion) was quite tasty. Overall an excellent hotel and conference center which I would highly recommend for a meetings or travel if the location is Austin."
4,Great location in Downtown Austin,"This Hilton is a perfect location for a business conference in Austin, one block from 6th Street. However, despite a negotiated rate, the added personal day was very expensive, including exorbitant prices for parking a hotel guest's car in the underground garage. All of the food catered by the hotel for the conference was incredibly delicious, but the breakfast off the menu at the hotel restaurant was just okay."
5,Very Comfortable and Convenient,"I've stayed in Austin many times but this was the first at the Hilton. I was attending an event at the conference center and was convenient. The property is very nice with an open, inviting lobby. The room was up to date and large. While the hotel has several restaurants, I only ate at two of them. The service was great. It's location is good even if you're not going to the convention center. It's a few blocks from 6th Street, a little further to Congress and pretty close to Rainey Street--my new favorite area."
5,The Best,"Very pleased with the stay. The hotel was very busy, yet staff and service did not suffer. Will use this hotel in Austin from now on. Very clean. The food was great and the meeting rooms were well prepared by staff."
5,Amazing visit to Austin for business.,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Austin area. Very clean, friendly staff and quiet. Request a higher floor for the awesome views. I would stay here again whenever I'm back in the area."
5,Definitely we will come back,We only stayed for 1 night but we fall in love with it. My kids love the pool. I want to thank specially to Duncan the bellman. Thanks a lot for giving us all the hotel information and helping us with our luggage with 4 toddlers that was a huge help for me I really appreciate.Definitely we will come back soon!!
5,Hotel for Conference,Stayed at this hotel for a conference for 3 days. From the start the staff was attentive. I arrived a little early before check in and my room was ready very quickly. Front desk was very professional and answered my questions on some Hilton points and hotel layout.Room was very clean and larger than i expected. Room had good flow and sicne I was on the corner had a decent view. it had the remote operated light system. But there was one lamp on desk that was always on when activated and not controlled remotely. I had to unplug the lamp to keep it off. This was a slight annoyance but nothing to worry about.The property was great for conference. I did not eat at the on scene bar or restaurants. Nothing bad about them just a personal preference.Had a nice conference on location and restful night sleep. On check out I had a early flight and check out was a breeze. Doorman helped get me a cab for trip to airport in fast time for the early morning.Overall a good stay and will be glad to stay again for next conference.
4,Business conference,we had a building materials trade conference in Austin. Ate at Cannon & Belle- what a great burger with chips. Food was 5 star but the service was 3 (long time to get things and had to ask for our tab in order to pay and make it to a meeting). Would recommend staying
3,Underwhelming,"Most travelers will stay here solely because of the conference centre, which is why I did.Pros: lovely staffCons: old & tired rooms, no minibar, no slippers, no dressing gowns, not even a hotel information book in the room. No pillow menu, and incredibly uncomfortable beds and pillows (pillows square shaped and lumpy rather than just a normal homogenous rectangular pillow)Unless you have to stay here, look elsewhere"
4,Good Visit,"I stayed in this hotel due to a work conference I had to attend. The rooms were spacious and looked like they had been remodeled recently. It seemed to be hot in the hallways and the air conditioning in the room would also change throughout the day. Overall, I like this hotel and thought that it was very comfortable. I did not like the food that was part of the catering in the meetings on the fourth floor. The elevators seem to get crowded easily and take a long time. I really like the restaurant downstairs where there was a bar area. I ordered a club sandwich upon arriving at the hotel and had the most delicious Creole chips with it. I did not get a chance to try the taco bar. However, my manager said it was good. I would definitely stay here again if promoted to return to Austin."
3,"Good service, nice environment, but old saggy mattress","Good environment, location and service staff at the hotel. My sleep was not comfortable. I was disappointed in the heavily used mattress that was not comfortable for my back, except the middle ridge that was rarely used."
4,Good Hotel but Poor Service,"Stayed at hotel for a conference. Came in town early and stayed a few days longer to enjoy Austin. The room was very nice (upgrade to a spacious executive suite). It was a tad pricey, but since we were in town for a full week, the extra room was nice. Room was modern, clean and comfortable. We used the outdoor pool on several occasions. Temperature could have bit a tad cooler as it was very hot during the week. Pool bar was open weekends, but not weekdays.Because we stayed in a suite, we had access to the executive lounge. The permanent lounge was being remodeled, so they had a temporary lounge setup on the ground floor (changed locations a few times). Food was good and more hearty than some hotels (breakfast tacos served one day). Only complaint was the limit on diet sodas. It appears that they set out only so many diet sodas each day and when they are gone, they are replaced with regular soda. Not sure why that is since the price should not be any different. Also, some days they had real half/half for coffee, other days they had imitation creamer.Service is restaurant and bar was horrible. After waiting 35 minutes for lunch, I asked for manager so we could get the bill and leave (I had to get back to conference). Had a similar situation with very slow service in bar. Waited about 15 minutes (it was not that busy). They finally sent over a few managers to assist the bar staff, but again it was not that busy so not sure why it took so long (and while we were waiting, neither server even acknowledged we were there).Had a great trip to Austin and a nice stay at Hilton. Just a few bad experiences with poor service."
3,Conference,"Average room and amenities. Good location in relation to 6th street, Beware of the valet parking. I have a 2019 SUV that was somehow damaged when parked in valet for 3 nights. I would advise anyone to take time stamped pictures prior to parking and look over all vehicle surfaces prior to leaving. I am going to have to have paint work done after paying $44.38 per night to park. The investigation done by security was a joke. The damage was either there when I got there, or it was not substantial enough. If I stay there again, I will take my chances and park at the convention center next door. I am going to notify my professional organization. Maybe we can stay at another hotel chain altogether."
1,5 star price for 2 star service,"We stayed at this hotel for a work conference for an entire week. The fridge froze our food and when we reported it, no one did anything. The bathroom had makeup from a previous guest splattered on the walls when we arrived, and WE ended up cleaning it after housekeeping apparently could not manage to clean it themselves. The parking garage did not register any of the guest hotel keys (despite us getting them re-keyed 3 times) and we had to sit and wait for security to let us in when both exiting and entering the parkade. We requested housekeeping during a 3.5 window so it didn‚Äôt interfere with our down time between lectures at our conference and they said it would be no problem and when we returned, housekeeping had still not been. When I spoke to housekeeping, they said they would send someone ‚Äúright away‚Äù but instead, the person just meandered down the hall following numerical order and we ended up leaving to allow housekeeping to do their job. If you want to pay top dollar for a hotel, I recommend choosing one who has service to reflect that‚Äôs. For the price we paid for one week, we could have stayed at a 3 star hotel for two weeks. If you are looking for a top of the line hotel, with top of the line service and facilities, I recommend looking somewhere else."
3,Business Trip Experience,"I arrived for a business trip on my first time to Austin, the Hotel was clean, the staff was nice and welcoming. I was concerned by the instructions I received upon check in advising me where to stay away from after dark. The location is has a high density of homeless people that are hanging around. It was common for someone to walk up to me after I stepped outside the hotel. I had to step outside the hotel on many occasions because the 1 ATM machine in the hotel was out of order during my stay. There is no gift shop where I could buy waters or snacks.The food was not wide in variety, and pretty overpriced in comparison to where I am from (Chicago).The 8th floor spa, gym, and pool are great! absolutely the best part of the hotel, great views, good drinks, and plenty of equipment from free weights, to machines to help you stay in shape.I recommend anyone who stays to try the taco place downstairs (Austin Taco Project) they made good drinks, well portioned, and served great tacos.The whole town is made for Uber and ride-sharing so plan ahead if you need a cab to take you anywhere."
5,Great facility! Outstanding staff! A 10!,"Hotels are generally all the same. And for a guy accustomed to spending over 100 nights per year in hotels this could have been any other place. The difference at the Hilton Austin was the staff, especially, the front desk staff and the customer service team. The latter contacted us by text immediately after check-in with what I thought was a nice but unnecessary ""welcome"" message. However, this team followed up on day 2 by asking us to rate our visit and when we gave a 9.5 responded by asking the obvious 'how could we make it a 10?'. The thing is THEY ASKED. And, after receiving my response - additional water and towels in the room - it was taken care of. This is so simple and the cost was virtually nothing. But it was the fact that they asked and responded. Thank you!"
4,Conference,Overall pleased. No parking available in hotel lot. Had to drive around a lot to find park. Ultimately did valet. Valet experience was efficient overall. Check in was quick and staff friendly. Only stayed one night but room was clean.
4,Not for families!,"Plus: Starbucks on site, clean spacious room, decent executive floor with decent breakfastNegative location, pool is flooded with drunk people and very dirty. The fitness room is okay, it tries to be exclusive. I definitely would not be back with kids maybe with a baccalaureate party"
4,My conference trip,"Downtown location, limited drive up vallet check in area, otherwise good Hilton quality. No gift shop / snack shop though. You MUST try the Austin Taco restaurant in the hotel....AMAZING. Very close to 6th street"
5,Hotel is wonderful. Area is just okay.,Starbucks is in the lobby. Great staff. Greasy restaurant in the lobby. The scooters are all around the park next to the hotel if you choose to use one. Convention center is right next door. Workout facilities are wonderful. Great outside pool on with floor.
5,In town for an event and it's the perfect location.,"This is a very nice hotel. It's in the middle of town and right by 6th street. Bedrooms are really nice, modern and comfortable. It also has a very nice pool, spa, restaurant and bar. I highly recommend a massage or spa treatment!"
5,Nice staff great location,I came in town for a conference the hotel was directly across the street which was great nice staff and clean hotel. Very busy. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The area felt safe and the had several local place in close proximity if you wanted to socialize.
4,"Large hotel, close to convention center",This hotel is right by the convention center and is very busy with corporate events and such. The rooms are decent but can be very expensive when there are a lot of events going on in town. I've stayed here twice and would come back again.
1,Overpriced and rude staff.,"Had a horrible experience at this hotel. We were obligated to get a room last minute and no other hotels had availability due to a UT Game. Well Hilton certainly took advantage of this. For $450 a night a expected to be treated better. Front desk staff was rude and condescending, food at the restaurant was overpriced and dry. Found a used wash cloth in the bathroom. Room service was rude and told me the hotel doesn't do anything for free. Will never stay here again."
5,Great place for a conference,"I was lucky enough to attend a conference at this hotel. From arrival to departure, I was impressed. The room was clean and well appointed. The gotel has 2 restaurants and a Starbucks. The taco restaurant was only so so, but I enjoyed the Belle and Cannon. The selection of drinks was unique, including local beers and the bartenders were friendly. They even remembered me and my preferred drink the second day.The spa was lovely and the outdoor salt water pool was amazing. There is a weight room and a cardio room along with a full service spa.They offer 24 hour room service as well, if you don't mind the extra 26 %, plus a delivery fee, not including tip.The visitor center is a blick away, and O Henry's home is right across the street. The only drawback is the continuous roadwork going on all around Austin as they struggle to keep up with a huge influx of people ( more than 100 per day) and a very visible homeless population in the city.I would definitely go back when it's not 102 degrees every day. It's a perfect spot to explore Austin."
2,Overpriced,"We had to get a room at this hotel as everything else in Austin was booked due to a game. Extremely overpriced. Paid $400 for a night. Front desk was rude and condescending. The restaurant was also overpriced, dry and hard (chicken and shrimp). Room service charges a service fee and a delivery fee. When I asked why both was told that the hotel doesn‚Äôt do anything for free. Will never stay again. Only thing I enjoyed was being able to walk to 6th street."
4,Nice Stylish Hotel,"First stop on our 2019 USA trip for 4 nights. Fast efficient check in, nice room. The whole hotel is stylishly furnished with some good eating options. Cannon and Belle is great. The executive lounge was being refurbished whilst we were there and was temporarily relocated to the Reverbery. It worked well, nice environment, cool atmosphere and Jordan the host was a real force of nature, upbeat, super helpful and full of energy. Only downside was the last day (Saturday) when it was relocated again to a small room which could only realistically handle 20 people max. It was chaotic and not enjoyable. Hotel maybe could/should have provided vouchers for Diamond members to use in the main restaurant. Excellent pool for a city centre hotel."
5,Austin Hiton Rocks!,Every aspect of this Hotel was excellent the food was great and the service was really top notch. I recommend the Austin Hilton over any Hotel in the Area. The entire Staff had a great positive helpful attitude and delivered in every way!
5,"Great hotel, Great Staff, Nice Location","This hotel is centrally located in downtown Austin and has multiple restaurants available inside, as well as nearby. The foyer is beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are nicely proportioned and clean."
5,"Great hotel, comfortable bed, quick check in","Was here for a conference and the check in took less than 5 minutes which was great because I was so tired from travelling all day. Staff was very courteous. The room is very big. I like how you can turn the lights on, change temp from a box next to the bed. The bed is very comfortable. Bathroom is very big. Nice closet. Overall a great experience. Starbucks is in the hotel too which is awesome."
3,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately, this property is not up to the standards of other Hilton properties. While the staff were friendly, the rooms were not well maintained and a little dirty. This property was more expensive than other Hilton properties I've used, but they don't offer breakfast ($8-15 at Starbucks or Cannon & Belle or $30 for room service)."
4,Great service & people,"The only issue we had when we stayed at the hotel was dried urine was still on the toilet when we arrived. When I tried calling downstairs to report the issue, was put on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally gave up and went downstairs to get another room. The people were great, but they need to retrain their cleaning staff!"
5,Great experience,We had a great experience in Austin this hotel is close to everything and the staff is great. We would definitely come back and stay again when we are in town. The pool was great as was the room service.
5,Came for Keller Williams convention,Fantastic location for anyone going to a convention in Austin. Beautiful hotel and the staff is always great. I love the recently renovated bar and restaurant area as well. Easy walking distance to 6th street and Rainey Street.
5,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"We attended a wedding in downtown Austin, TX with the reception a block away from this hotel.The hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful. The large rooms were an added bonus. Though we did not use the gym or the pool, they were on site and available. There is a Starbuck's in the lobby and the abundance of food venue's within walking distance is a big plus."
4,Checkout Error,"When checking out we were overcharged $200 by the night manager in charge. The manager reversed it after we reviewed our receipt and brought it to his attention his error, but the bank doesn't quickly reverse mistaken charges."
5,Austin Hilton,"Great location, great stay, clean and great staff. Restaurants and bar in hotel are great, very good food. Close to 6th street but don't recommend going there, dirty, lots of homeless, go to 2nd street!"
5,Perfect home base to experience Austin!,"I love the Hilto brand and the Hilton Austin did not disappoint. Easy walk to Congress Ave Bridge for bat watching and 6th Street for nightlife. Also walked to South Congress shopping, Warehouse District and Rainey Street for fun, and the Capitol for some culture. Couldn't have found a better place!!!"
2,Horrible Customer Service,"The hotel is in a great location. I had high expectations since it was a full service Hilton. Was I wrong... The staff at the front desk were very rude and didn't want to help. As a Diamond member, I was not offered any upgrades, were never told about my breakfast amenity and was told the Business Lounge was closed for upgrades. If would have known the Lounge was closed at booking, I would have stayed at a different hotel. After a horrible interaction with the front desk regarding the Lounge, I decided to give up. Horrible service."
5,Overnighter,I stayed there on points due to the fact I had business in Austin the next day. There were a WHOLE lot of Scentsy people there as well. I learned they were having the annual conference right next door. Other than a few if those RUDE people the hotel was great!! The room was nice as was the check in and check out procedures. Thanks HILTON.
3,Don't do Room upgrade!,"Don't waste your time if you want to upgrade to an ""executive level"" room. Complete waste. Their website and Hilton Honors provide a great description of those rooms but they are no different than a Hampton Inn. I stay at several Hilton properties throughout the year and had never had an issue till I stayed at this property. I upgraded using HH points thinking that the marketing of the upgrade would be really nice. I walked in room and thought it was a joke! I could've just stay downstairs and saved about 150,000 points. I was so frustrated after speaking with Hilton Honors and the onsite manager, that I reduced my stay and left early. Hope this helps someone along the way! I was very disappointing to say the least."
4,Very Convenient and Comfortable,"The Hilton Austin couldn‚Äôt be more convenient to attendees of Austin Conference Center events. The Hilton is just across the street and has a bridge to the fourth floor of the conference center. I found the Hilton very comfortable with attractive open meeting areas on the first floor and generous, well appointed guest rooms. Ample parking is available downstairs, and a recharging station is available for electric vehicles. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. If you‚Äôre headed for Sixth Street or the Capital, you‚Äôll find the Hilton well located."
4,Members have great benefits at executive lounge.,"As Hilton honors platinum members,We like the lounge access, and hours.The pool and jacuzzi area are great for sunset time, and relax.We got an noisy side( north side, 5th and 6th bars)on the first night, quickly they changed for us on the second day.So that was very nice. Great location, decor is modern, staff is fine."
4,Yearly trip,Love the location. Very convenient to everything. Grab a scooter and go explore. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Starbucks was on site. Wish they had a quick service restaurant . Breakfast buffet was average
5,Good hotel,Especially good hotel if your stay involves activities at the Convention Center. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Rooms are clean and recently updated. Really nice outdoor pool and fitness center.
5,Fantastic day at the SPA!,"The Hilton has a wonderful spa on the rooftop of their downtown hotel. I spent the day there with my cousin and daughter-in-law. All of us walked out of there at the end of the day talking about how these had been THE-BEST- MASSAGES of our lives! The staff was wonderful, engaging, and friendly. It was such a great day!"
5,Rescued from the clutches of the garden inn,"Came here when the Hilton Garden Inn declared themselves overbooked at 1am after 25hours travel. The Hilton agreed to take me and rescued me from the local homeless shelter. Wellcome from the night reception was excellent and as some compensation, despite being in no way to blame, I was given executive lounge access. This proved excellent for a quiet breakfast and afternoon snacks.Hotel was an excellent standard with good staff all round. Room was very clean and the bathroom had a tub. The only bizarre twist was room cleaning. The cleaner replace shampoo and shower gel, which I was using, with conditioner and body lotion, which I wasn‚Äôt using. Meant I had too much of what I wanted but none of the things I did.Was more than the garden inn but worth the extra."
5,1 block away from Sixth Street at Perfect location .,"Perfect location at 1 block away from Sixth Street. Did not feel unsafe at any time. Clean, Great Staff & Amenities were great. They really go above and beyond to ensure you are happy with your stay. It also has an excellent HONORS Club membership. They treat you great! Loved it!"
5,Fantastic hotel! 5/5!,"My sister and I stayed at this hotel three years in a row, and each time we had clean rooms, superior service, and purchased quality food via room service. The Austin Hilton definitely exceeded my expectations!"
4,Well styled and excellent location,"This hotel is close to all of the action. You can walk, or you can take a cheap Uber/Lyft. Plenty of restaurants and entertainment nearby. While the hotel is nice, it's a little pricey for what it is, especially the parking (whether self or valet). However, the valet service was friendly and fast. Front desk service was hit or miss."
4,Comfortable stay,"Our stay was very quite and comfortable. The lobby was very fancy, and the valet parking was $41.00, a little much if you ask me. Self parking was $35, in same garage.Hotel is right down town so we walked to most everything we needed. we had a nice stay but Austin is a little too busy for us."
3,Overpriced for what you get,"The Hilton Austin on Fourth Street downtown is quite striking as you enter the lobby. Beautiful granite & marble, high-end light fixtures, spacious grand public areas, stylish and comfy furnishings. In my opinion, where it falls short is in details.Such as:-The bathroom in the room has no exhaust fan. So after a shower, your entire room is filled with steam.-The toilet paper they give you is thin and scratchy.-The coffee service in my room had everything you would expect except stir sticks. I had to ask three times to get some. I was not a happy camper at 6 AM, making coffee... (Also the coffee maker is really cheap and will only make a 6 ounce cup of coffee.)-When housekeeping made up our room, they did not re-supply us with any of the things that my family used up (shampoo, conditioner, dirty glasses not replaced‚Ä¶). Again,I had to ask repeatedly to get what we needed.-No microwave, which I have come to expect in a hotel room. When I have leftovers from my dinner, I like to reheat them later.-The bedding is really sub-par for this price point. Very odd comforter/blanket combo thing. Pillows that are so squishy they are useless. Some of our bedding, sheets or mattress covers, was obviously ripped.- The AC switches automatically between heating and cooling, meaning that if your room is just a little bit too cold and you turn the thermostat up a degree or two, the HEAT comes on (rather than just stopping the air conditioning until the temperature rises). Disconcerting when this happens in the middle of summer, in Austin!-There is no ‚Äúfree breakfast‚Äù included with the room, not even a coupon to redeem or a discount at the lobby Starbucks.-Parking is ridiculously overpriced, even for downtown Austin.They have a gorgeous, luxurious, spacious spa complete with a saline pool, overpriced massage and skin treatments, and a nicely-appointed workout room.Honestly, if you aren‚Äôt interested in the spa, or planning to hang out in some of the well appointed public spaces, there are plenty of hotels in Austin, even in downtown, that charge far less and give much better value.Well we didn‚Äôt hate staying at the Hilton downtown, we won‚Äôt be returning to it."
4,surprisingly pleasing,"I don't usually stay at the Hilton, and I am generally not a fan of enormous, big box hotels, but this was the best deal for the area I wanted to stay in and for the amenities I wanted. It turned out to be handy that it was such a ""big box"" because we could often find it from a distance without having to consult the gps. And with the hot weather outside, it was always refreshing to walk into its air conditioned and spacious lobby area from either side we approached the building. I was pleasantly surprised that the room was quiet (helps that we were on 22nd floor!), clean and sufficiently equipped. The bathroom has flattering lighting, a real door (unlike the Marriott's open-ended sliding plank of wood!) with a hook on the back and a shelf under sink where you can toss clothes. The tv channel options seemed limited, but we were happy with our stay overall. They were able to accommodate our early arrival which was most helpful. We opted to park in the hotel's pricey garage as it was not as pricey or inconvenient as other options nearby. It was worth it to be able to come and go as we pleased and not have to pay again each time.The location was convenient to walk to see the 4th of July fireworks down along the bridge / water and for bat viewing in the same place, and it is right around the corner from the visitor's center where a lot of driven guided tours take off."
3,Not Up to (Hilton) Par,"Very surprised about the condition of the room upon arrival -- carpet stained in our room, three of the four lights attached to headboard did not work; one of the two USP outlets on the night stand did not work and shower handle was very loose, which made it a bit difficult to set the temperature of the water. Left a note for housekeeping to leave (4) ""regular"" coffee pouches, and was given only (2). Twice! On the positive side, the beds were very comfortable and towels were thick/plush.Drinks/snacks at the pool bar were was over priced, and the mixed drink marginal. Bartender seemed annoyed with my questions. The overall pool/spa areas are very nice, but spa prices made it easy for me to decide to NOT get a facial or massage. Fitness areas were nice.Lobby restaurant -- food was GREAT, but lunch service was very poor; waited over an hour for food. The taco place on the lower level was GREAT -- good/unique tacos and excellent service.There are plenty of dining choices within walking distance -- 6th Street is ""party central"" but despite all the ruckus on a Saturday night, there were plenty of places to eat and avoid much of the noise."
2,Not So Clean Room,"The people came in everyday to straighten the bed and put in clean towels, but things were dusty. The carpet was very stained and there was suntan lotion on the doors of the closet. We stayed for 4 nights and each day I waited to see if things would be cleaned, but nope."
3,Luxurious hotel without well cleaned rooms and no amenities,"The hotel room was big, but it wasn't very clean. I arrived early for a Conference at the Convention Center and was able to check in early. And that was a big mistake. The air conditioning was off, the room was hot, and didn't smell very well. I left my baggage and went to eat outside, and wanted to notify the front desk but the line was very long. So, I decided to come back to my room. Now the temperature was better. But the smell was still there. It appeared the room was closed or unused for a long time. There was dust on the carpet and long black hair in the bathroom. My allergy confirmed that carpet hasn't beeb well cleaned before I arrive.This is a very expensive Hotel, but should emphasize in the cleaning a thats the best customer service a hotel can give.Also, there were a Starbucks (closed early), and 2 restaurants."
5,Nice location and friendly staff,We stayed here for a few days because we were in town for a wedding. It was easy to walk around the area. Staff was friendly. Had the buffet for breakfast and it was good. We would stay here again. We did notice that this was a friendly hotel for pets. We say lots of dogs walking around.
5,Very nice hotel and great people,Very nice hotel and great staff. Didn't love the Austin Taco Project restaurant but the other restaurant was good. Very nice gym/spa and pool. Nice common areas in lobby. No real complaints and would definitely stay again.
2,My stay!,My co worker and I stayed here for work and also it was our first time in Austin. When we got into our room I immediately had to use the restroom and the flusher was slightly broken so we had to just work around it because we were in a hurry. Then we left the room and I noticed I didn‚Äôt hear the door click shut so I walked back and sure enough the door wasn‚Äôt locking unless you physically pulled it closed each time. Then the evening came and we went to grab our ‚Äúcold waters‚Äù out the fridge and the fridge wasn‚Äôt cooling. We were super busy and a 100% full agenda. I called down to the front desk to report everything and the woman wasn‚Äôt sure when someone could come up and neither of us felt comfortable having someone in our room with out us there and we didn‚Äôt have any time to spare to wait for someone. So upon check out the next day I mentioned to Anthony at the front desk all the issues we had and he‚Äôs reaction was so rude and could honestly careless. So it makes me think they were aware of these issues but didn‚Äôt care to fix them. I took a video of the door but it won‚Äôt let me post it.
3,"Beautiful hotel, subpar customer service","My husband and I decided last minute to celebrate his birthday with a mini staycation! Excited, we arrived at Hilton Austin around 11pm on a Saturday night. The parking garage was a little hard to find and there's construction being done on the building. Any entrance other than the main entrance is locked after 10 PM for safety. Which is understandable; but there were no signs pointing which way you should go. My husband and I tried 3 different entrances before finding the correct one. There was no doorman and no one to hold the door open for us.The inside of the hotel was beautiful and we were greeted promptly.Being that we'd booked the reservation less than 2 hours ago, my husband's ID said we were local, and his birthday was less than an hour away I was expecting ""Thanks for celebrating with us, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Let us know anyway we can help make your stay more enjoyable."" But there was no acknowledgment. The room was nice. Your basic mid/upper class hotel room, a bed, couch, TV. It was also clean and the bed was comfortable.One thing we loved was the hotel's proximity to all downtown's festivities! It was literally a party right outside our front door!Once, we arrived back I approached the front desk to have our ice cream delivered to go with our cake. The hotel had a sign stating ""if anything is wrong during your stay let us know we'll make it right"". So I mentioned to Heather the agent how she'd missed the opportunity to acknowledge my husband's birthday earlier when we'd checked in. To make it right she offered us a $50 room service credit. However, we ordered room service and forgot to give our comp ticket when our meals were delivered. The next morning we called dining to straighten it out. The girl on the other end of the said she'd have it taken care of. However 3 days later I see my account and we were charged. I called the hotel to get it straightened out.The hotel operator (in house) was rude and and the way she disconnected was ""Well alright then"" and hung up while I was still talking. She never bothered to ask if I needed any additional assistance, or at the very least say ""Thanks for calling Hilton Austin, enjoy your evening."" It's days later and the hotel operator today spoke very unprofessional as well. Also, no one's yet to reach out to me.Honestly, I don't mind the charge it was my husband's birthday. However, I hate the unprofessionalism and the bad customer service. I didn't expect anything free but I did expect an acknowledgment and to feel great about our experience. Over most of our lives hotels play major roles in different events. Us personally, our engagement was the J.W. Marriott in (downtown Austin). Our reception Embassy Suites. This memory, as far as with this particular hotel was sub par at best. Not enough for me to want to celebrate any future occasions there. Nor would I suggest any one else celebrate anything else there.Note to management re-train your staff on ""exceptional"" customer service.You may not be a 5 diamond hotel but at least strive to be. Strive for awesomeness at every touch point with every guest."
5,Great Service,"My toothpaste exploded in my suitcase and ruined my suit jacket. Housekeeping took care of it on a Saturday night and had it back to me in hours. Can't thank them enough for going the extra mile to help me. The hotel was modern, clean and convenient too. Loved the pool."
3,Average,We stayed at the Best Western near th Executive Airport the second night and it was infinitely cleaner than the Hilton In downtown Austin. We‚Äôve stayed at many Hiltons and this was worse than any hotel I‚Äôve stayed in for the last 20 years
5,Very friendly Staff,"Very friendly and patient staff.I am diamond member and was able to be upgraded to executive room.Nice amenities for the hotel, gym and pool, executive lounge, etc.Definitely coming back next time."
5,"Centrally Located, Fantastic Staff, Great Value","Hilton comes through like always! They're pet friendly for only $50 per stay which is cheaper than most. Nice, spacious lobby, modern rooms, very friendly and accommodating staff. Their systems were down but were still able to check us in 2 hours before normal check-in time (thank you Kittana). Check-out is done with a simple text and an emailed receipt. Perfect location; connected to Starbucks, adjacent to a small park, bordering 4th and 5th streets, walkable to Rainey St, 6th St, most attractions. Taco Project Restaurant in hotel is very good and staff there excellent as well! Highly recommend."
3,Beautiful hotel lacked in comfort,This Hilton is positioned in the heart of Austin and the convention center. We had a room on the connoisseur level which had great amenities. The room was beautiful but the pillows and mattresses needed to be updated. Our pillows were small and firm for a King bed and the mattress was lumpy. Maybe they are ready to do any upgrade and I hope they do. Hilton has very high standards and we have always had comfortable stays around the country.
5,Another Great Stay,"Hilton Austin consistently delivers year after year. Several special request were immediately fulfilled. Great rooms, facilities and most important, staff. Executive level was well worth the price with the lounge and other amenities. Always a great hotel if wanting a place downtown!"
2,Great location and staff. HORRIBLE BEDS,"CONS:The beds, bedding, and pillows are the worst I have ever had and I travel very often. Terrible nights sleep because of it. Rooms are comparable to a 2/3 star hotel. But you‚Äôre paying for a 4 star...PROSThe location is prime. Staff is great!"
5,Wedding,We loved the hotel. Service was excellent very efficient and very friendly. Specially at the valet parking Bryan was always very friendly and helpful and at the Restaurant Chelsea was always kind and very helpful we were very happy to had her as our server. We stayed for three days and we always got an excellent service. Thanks so much you all.
4,Thank yku,It was a good stay! Everything needed was provided by staff. Pillows were missing but provided. Starbucks closed too early. Staff that cleaned the room was very nice and greeted usEvery day and every morning.
2,Only stay if your a bar hopper,The hotel is perfectly located if you‚Äôre a bar hopper. It‚Äôs one block from 6th ave where all the bars and clubs are. Even in the 23rd floor we could hear the music. Downtown has a large homeless population that is 2 blocks away. The hotel messed our account so bad... charged my card 3 times and gave us 2 sets of room keys and neither one lets us out of the parking garage. They finally comped our $32 a day parking and have to give us several paper tickets just to get in and out of the garage. The manager Anthony was fantastic... wish I could say the same for his staff. I‚Äôm a loyal Hilton Honors member and I will still stick with them.... just not this location.
5,Conference stay,"Being a Hilton Honors member I was happy that the conference was held here.My checkin was fast. With the apps available, I chose my room in advance. Also love the digital key feature.Room was spacious and very clean. Like the light controller.Will stay again on visits to Austin."
5,Great Stay and Great Lost & Found Services,"Great Hotel- even better security/lost & found! Left a pair of new Nike Air Maxes and Chris Simmons tracked them down, took care of shipping and got them back to me right away! It was greatly appreciated!Thanks Chris !"
5,Perfect Austin hotel,This hotel location is perfect location to fully enjoy the city. The hotel has many amenities perfect for business or a couples get away. I sunset asking for additional pillows because the pillows are small and thin. This is my second visit and I plan to return again. Austin is a great city to explore.
5,That pool tho...,"The hotel is awesome. The taco restaurant had the best churros I‚Äôve ever eaten. Cannon & Belle had some amazing pancakes and breakfast. The pool was just amazing. The string lights, the infinite edges, the AstroTurf, the views, the bar, and the shade were just perfect. Absolutely recommend this place. The Starbucks in the lobby was also a hit. It‚Äôs right in the middle of everything. My room had an amazing view and at light it was gorgeous."
5,#1 Hotel in Region,I‚Äôve spent a lot of time at this hotel over the years... This is the best place to be in Austin! The people and the tacos will keep you coming back. Rooms just renovated with ridiculous TVs and trippy carpet. Rooftop pool & steam room! Best location of all the big downtown hotels. I‚Äôd pay more to stay here than the JW or Fairmonte.
5,AUSTIN weekend,"Great weekend in a fun city. The hotel is centrally located and convenient to all forms of transportation. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only downside, the outdoor pool bar on 8th floor closed relatively early (@ 5pm) when I was there on Sunday. Otherwise no complaints with my stay."
5,Being a tourist in Austin,The hotel was fabulous but Austin has a homeless problem they need to deal with. They harass you on the street & follow you into the hotel. It's a bit pricy but that is to be expected in the capital city I guess.
5,First trip to Austin,"Austin is a great place to visit. Lots of music and restaurants. A few too many bars for people who don't drink though. Big claim to fame is the 1.5 million bats that come out nightly, but they don't come out in May!"
4,Nice stay - one amazing staff member in particular,"The hotel was fine, but I left my laptop upon checkout. I realized this at the airport. I called the hotel and security officer Michael Price secured it and shipped it overnight. He truly took the very best care of my laptop, which I appreciate more than I can say.The hotel is perfectly located in Austin. You can walk anywhere downtown. The restaurant and bar are great. The rooms are up to par for most Hiltons.I had an issue with noise in the room next door. I had to complain twice, but it still didn't improve. I would advise the hotel to be more mindful of this aspect of the experience, particularly since there was a major conference taking place that I was attending."
4,Good option close to convention center,"I was in town for a conference, and the Hilton is well-located right across the street from the convention center. Clean and well-appointed room. Dining options in the hotel are quite good, although limited if you'll be there for several days."
5,Best place to stay in Austin,"As always, the Hilton Austin has been a great place to stay. It is located downtown. Even at my age, I love going to 6th Street, which is only one block away, and indulge in the music scene that it has to offer. We even used the Spa this time and it was GREAT. Look forward to making time to use it again on our next visit. Thank you Hilton Austin."
4,May 2019 visit,"Staff was very helpful at checkin and in the restaurant. Location was close to 6th street and Congress Avenue. 20 minute walk to the Bar Colony and Lady Bird Hike and Trail, 20 minute walk to the State Capitol so very well situated."
3,Restaurant cleanliness,"Extremely dirty seat, floor area. Pointed out two days, two different people. The third morning, still gross. I will not go back because of that. Rest of hotel was lovely. Difficult to enjoy a meal with a ledge full of crumbs and long black hair beside you..."
4,Close to Everything,"I was at the hotel for a conference. But in my off time I was able to enjoy some of Austin. The capital was a short Uber Ride. I was able to walk to local restaurants, music venues and a local park. My room was on the fourth floor so I also able to enjoy a view."
5,Great!!,"Great experience from start to finish, the room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was very knowledgeable and caring. Garrett at the front desk and John with the bell staff were great! If ever in Austin again I will be there."
3,Business trip.,"AC did not cool good and the digital key did not work. I reported the problem twice and if they came in the room to fix the issue, they did not leave anything stating that they checked the AC.It was nice being close to the bats and downtown.We enjoyed the happy hour."
4,A reprieve from 6th Street madness,"The location of this hotel cannot be beat if your main objective is to visit downtown, 6th street, and Rainey Street. The breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing, each offering had a decidedly Austin twist, and I was more than satisfied at the plethora of choices. The lobby itself is not the most welcoming, but the staff was more than nice and accommodating at check in and with any questions and requests I had. The room was well appointed, though we had an issue with cleanliness upon checking in. The housekeeper was more than apologetic, took care of the issue immediately, and offered assurances that the issue would be addressed with all the staff. The concierge lounge was a nice touch, with free soft drinks and various breads, cheeses, vegetables, and other finger foods. The rooftop pool was an extremely nice touch, heated and a great accompaniment to the hot tub. Overall, I would absolutely stay again if I wanted to be smack dab in the craziness of downtown again."
3,Dirty,"In town for a conference at the Hilton We arrive in the room to find previous resident‚Äôs sick. (See photo). The room was superficially cleaned each day. I noticed dirty elevators, chairs on the conference level and dirty entry to the hotel. I expect more."
5,"EXCELLENT HOTEL, AND SHOULD BE FOR THE PRICE!","We're not much for downtown hotels because of the parking hassles and hustle and bustle getting situated, however it was a family affair so we went with the flow. Everything was superb and priced accordingly. They have an excellent breakfast buffet. The hotel is a block away from 6th Street, Austin's answer to Bourbon Street in New Orleans, so one can imbibe and stagger back to their hotel. Our room was on the 22nd floor with a view across IH35 to the residential area beyond. Some of our family had better views looking toward downtown."
3,Decidedly Average,OK. That‚Äôs about it really. Should be more for the cost. Walls are paper thin. If you like hearing your neighbor‚Äôs conversations (and more) then ok. Not much of a view. Amenities ok. Nothing to clean shoes with or fix a button on my shirt. Just rather average. Expected much more for the price.
5,Perfect Wedding Weekend Experience,"We recently used the Hilton Austin for our wedding hotel, and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. Our wedding was elsewhere, but this was the only hotel we got a room block for, and we're glad we did.I travel a lot for work and have probably been to 100 different Hilton brand properties, and initially I was concerned that this hotel would only be ""ok"", and wouldn't be the same experience at staying at the Westin or JW. While I would give the rooms themselves a 4/5 (still very good!), the executive lounge was a 5/5, and the service was simply stellar, and that's what really counts.I was pleasantly surprised by how the staff anticipated our needs and was in constant contact. Josh Brown, one of the event managers, was a rock star throughout the entire process, and we felt lucky to get to work with him!100% would use the Hilton again for another event, room block, or recommendation for business travel."
5,Business trip in Austin,Great property in Austin! The Hilton Austin is conveniently located near the convention center and 6th Street. The service was excellent and the room was very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend it!
3,Overpriced for what you get,"Parking costs are ludicrous. $41 for valet parking and $31 for self-parking per night regardless if you take your car out. The rooms are half the size of a typical hotel room that costs half as much. No free breakfast and at $200+ a night you kind of expect at least something. Not even free coffee for guests, except for the coffee make in your room. However, my room was very clean and people are friendly but I am never coming back."
4,Perfect for Wedding block,The Hilton Austin was where we had our primary hotel block for our wedding. The hotel is very centrally located and reasonably proced. They gave us a 20 room block and a suite for me and my wife. It‚Äôs a large hotel. Lots of places to eat and drink there and nearby.
4,Great hotel until they stole my jewelry...,"Great accommodations and courteous staff. All requests were honored. This hotel has fantastic and user friendly public spaces including two restaurants on site and a Starbucks. I ate at the Taco Project twice. Great outdoor space at the restaurant and the food was amazing!Unfortunately, my jewelry was stolen out of my room on my last night there. The security team was responsive, but I have not heard back from the hotel since reporting the incident. I typically use a safe for important and valuable items, but I don't typically lock my jewelry...we're not taking about diamonds and Cartier watches. I hope the hotel does something to address this issue. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel. I would even consider returning and using the SAFE!"
4,Wedding,"Very nice hotel within walking distance to restaurants and clubs. Nice bar area and restaurant. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. the bathroom was clean, the toilet flushed good and had no trouble with the shower drain backing up. All of the staff were super friendly and helpful. It was an enjoyable stay."
5,Austin HIlton - great experience,"Stayed at the Austin Hilton several times, both business and get away style Always on top of their game.From the entry valet crew, bell crew, registration and check out staff. ALL excellent and very friendly people."
5,Great stay,Amazing location downtown!!! It is kinda hard to found due to the construction had to go around the block a couple of times just found location.This is located right next to the convention center literally. Very close to all the bar and stuff about a 10 min walk to the action.*Parking* We parked in the convention center garage just for 10 dollars for 12 hours so if you leave and come back you get another 10 dollars for another 12 hours so that better than 32.00 a day.Easy check in and check out !! Hotel is huge! they have a restaurant inside with a full bar and also plays music during the day.Room was amazing & very clean an spacious.Will be staying again thanks Hilton!
5,Nice Hotel Great location,"Stayed here for a few nights while on a house hunting trip in Austin. The room was clean and quiet, beds were comfortable. My boys loved the rooftop pool and gym. This hotel was close to everything downtown which was great--we are old and traveling with kids- so we didn't go to the bars on 6th street- but if we were young and fun its walking distance and looked like a great time. Self Parking was $32/day- which seems the norm in the area.Service was great, not problems. Starbucks on site too--so that was a bonus."
4,Great experience,"Hotel is in a great location, and every single employee with whom I interacted was outstanding. Lobby and rooms are quite nice. Bar area is good. I had dinner both in the restaurant and in room service; menus were decent, but not particularly exciting for a vegetarian. Would definitely stay here again."
4,Great Hotel and Meeting Center,Came here for a conference and was extremely satisfied with the accommodations. Our room was nicely appointed and comfortable and the meeting/ballroom area was very nice. There are some good restaurants within a decent walking distance which makes it great location-wise.
2,Convenient for meetings,"Certainly a great place for meetings, good number of rooms, elevators, IT folks. Nice restrooms :) The hotel rooms were standard and clean. The dinner at the hotel restaurant was actually really good!"
4,Nice stay,"I have stayed At this Hilton property 4 times. The accommodations are of consistent good quality and the staff are well trained and courteous. The location is excellent and most of the downtown Austin sites are within a comfortable walking distance,"
4,Nice Place,"Me, my Wife and Daughter had a Very nice experience. It was our first time visiting Austin. Great location. Hotel is very clean inside. Surrounding area is a bit run down. We spent time in SOCO and Rainey Street area."
4,Just steps away from the convention center,"I booked 6 nights for a medical convention not realizing that the property was literally accross the street from the convention center. That was a nice bonus. I was a little disappointed that just I received the room I checked-in online the day before not knowing that it was just below the executive lounge. Every morning from before 6am I was awaken by furniture movement noise. As a Diamond member, I hoped for something better. I received lounge access but the lounge is relatively small with a limited food choice for breakfast and evening hors-d'oevres. There was a little variety of the hot food offerings with in the morning sometimes bacon, sometimes sausages and scrambled eggs.There is a cash bar, 6$ for wine and (US) beer during the evening hors-d'oeuvres.The room and bathroom are typical Hilton, nothing special but OK. The pool area is is not big but had enough long chairs for the number of people using it. There is only sun in the afternoon, perfect for a short post-meeting rest..."
5,Great location,"Easy walk or Uber to many fine restaurant. Walk way to the convention center. Our stay was not with out a couple glitches, but they were handled well. My idea of customer service is not that an error can happen, but how it is handled. The manager went out of her way to correct the issue. She was very friendly and professional.Enjoyed the Continental breakfast in the executive lounge. The fruit was fresh and tasty.Would stay here again ."
4,Wonderful accommodatoins,"The hotel is lovely. The staff accommodated a late checkout for my hilton honor member status, though only by 1 hour. The fitness center has TVs on each cardio machine and complimentary ear buds. The spa area with pool has a sauna and steam room with jacuzzi, all were a wonderful addition to my stay. The location is within walking distance of numerous great restaurants, some overpriced and some worth every dollar. Ironworks BBQ, Gus's fried chicken, and 24 hour Diner were the favorites and all within 1 mile, most less than 0.5 miles. The Bat Bridge is also within walking distance, as well as a metro station and bus station directly across from this hotel."
5,Excellent downtown hotel,This hotel is very centrally located in Downtown Austin. Great views from the rooms. Room service was very good. I used valet parking and it was great. Meeting rooms were very easy to find. Plenty of elevators to move people around.
5,Great but pricey stay for convention center,Most convenient hotel for events at the convention center. Staff was great. Room was very clean and comfortable . Executive lounge is really nice. Great fitness center. Only negative is the in room towels are more like s Red Roof quality than a $400 per night Hilton. Otherwise was really nice
3,"Clean, convenient location, disapointing breakfast","Clean spacious room, good location for sightseeing,, comfortable bed... but avoid the hotel restaurant for breakfast. Very overpriced and nothing special. I ordered two eggs. Had to order toast separately. Eggs came on an oddl designed plate that made it look dirty, .no garnish, nothing. Quality of eggs was average...IHOP quality at best. Toast was was $4.00 and ordinary. Husband‚Äôs oatmeal was not very warm and also ordinary. Service was perfuntory. Unfortunately, not much in the immediate area for alternative quick breakfast other thanover priced Starbucks. Clearly geared toward convention goers on expense or being provided food as part of conference. Water available in lobby but costs in room. Coffee maker in room ( 2 cups) but chemical creamer only. I will say I liked the lobby design..rustic and Modern Texan with lots of individual seating and working spaces."
4,Better than average USA Hilton,"Being Diamond HH members we were able to get an upgrade to the Executive level. Room #2558 was pleasant and spacious with a good view of the city. We've noticed some Hiltons don't have executive lounges; however, this Hilton has an exec lounge. Exec lounges across the country are not equal. We have been to some that were wonderful while others have been dreadful. The quality of snacks and breakfast in the Austin Exec lounge falls somewhere in the middle; hence, 4 stars instead of 5. (As an aside, we've stayed at Double Tree Hiltons which have executive lounges and where the Hilton in the same city has none.) The main drag - 6th Street - is nearby, although a tad creepy at night. There are many good restaurants within easy walking distance."
3,Average all around,"The Hilton Austin is an average hotel with a busy lobby, standard rooms and in a neighborhood that can seem sketchy at times. It is right across from the convention center and a few blocks from Congress Avenue. There are a couple historic homes right across the street. Entry is free and if you have a few minutes, take some time to visit.There are a couple restaurants available onsite (I did not try them) and a Starbucks just off the lobby (really overpriced as it is part of the hotel.) Just walk a few blocks and you'll find some more options. Front desk staff were helpful, and the cleaning staff did a great job keeping the room clean and fresh.The price point of the hotel was pretty high but Austin can be an expensive place to stay. The room was comfortable but not especially spacious with 2 queen beds and desk and a chair squeezed in next to the window. The bathroom was fine (Hilton's standard & good quality amenities) but again, a bit cramped. I just expected more for $400/night.Austin is struggling with a growing homeless population so expect to be approached by people asking for help."
4,Great conference hotel,Hotel is clean and staff are pleasant. It‚Äôs location is ideal for access to the conference center and to walking in the downtown area. The bed was good and rooms were nice. This is not a luxury hotel. Common areas are nicer than the rooms which have a standard Hilton feel. The bar downstairs is nice with good drinks and it is nice that there is a Starbucks in the hotel which makes morning coffee easy. I would recommend for conferences and family‚Äôs that want to be downtown within easy walking access to the city. Other hotels in the area cost less with same walking access. You clearly pay a premium for location with this hotel.
4,Business Trip,"Site of a conference I attended. Hotel was very clean, staff was seen on a regular basis doing preventative maintenance and cleaning. Housekeeping was very good. Great exercise / pool area. Great location, close to 6th Street and the trail along the Colorado River."
5,Above and beyond service from Chris Simmons,"I arrived too early to check into my room so I was working in the lobby and discovered I forgot my laptop charger. Chris Simmons from security hunted down exactly the charger I needed and told me I could keep it for the duration of my stay and just leave it at the front desk when I check out. This was a huge relief and now I don't have to spend time figuring out where I can buy one! His demeanor and attitude was super friendly - all about how he could help. Thank you, Chris!!"
3,Hilton Austin,"Conveniently located on 5th, 1 minute walk to the heart of the action on Austin's 6th Street. Hotel is clean but basic room appointments, and certainly well over priced compared to other Hilton properties like Amsterdam, San Francisco, etc. Great location but not a good value for $400 USD per night."
3,Tough Place to Rate,"This is a convention hotel. The rooms are clean. The front desk staff is not very welcoming. I am 100k Flyer and stay in lots of hotels. The front desk staff is quite disappointing. They are the first impression and its not good. The Bell staff is a complete opposite. So is the Valet Staff. They are both quite welcoming. The restaurant in the lobby is very good and the staff is very nice. To be honest, I think I would stay someplace else. There is a Marriott courtyard short walk away. For the money I spent, this place lacked something. Location is very good."
2,The worst stay Ive unfortunately had,"While the hotel is pretty standard, the staff was the worst I have ever dealt with. They could not extend my stay by one day due to being booked through a travel website, and they did not know about there own Hilton price matching that is one there website and in the tv commercials. When I informed them off them the staff were dumbfounded and after confirming with a manager told me I had to call a number to price match a price I found online to extend my stay. The price was $100 less than Hiltons price and only for one night! Rooms were fine. Typical hotel stuff, but would recommend the Extended Stay hotel down the road for $200 less a night and a nicer room, with empathetic and helpful staff."
3,College town for sure.,"Average hotel. Not worth it for the price of rooms each night and the price of parking. In the middle of a busy city, which is nice for some but hectic for others. 2 in hotel resteraunts so if you don't plan on walking, hopefully you like what they have to offer. We didn't. Rooms not the cleanest at second glance. In hotel store too pricy. Starbucks was the best part. Be prepared to walk across the large lobby to get your luggage from parking garage to the other side of the hotel and the guest rooms. We were there for a conference and think we will stay at another hotel and just walk the few minutes to the conference next year. Probably save some money and get better service."
3,Not what I think of when you say Hilton,"This is a conference hotel. Rooms are nice and clean. The ""amenities"" (pool, hot tub, executive lounge) are only available until 10pm. But close to 6th St and close to a lot of night life. If you dont plan on staying in your room except to shower and sleep, here you go."
5,Conference Hotel - Downtown Austin Hilton,"Conference trip for work at Hilton-Austin. Outstanding experience! The 6th floor conference facilities were some of the most comfortable I have ever encountered, with incredible staff and awesome climate control. The rooms were spotless, the staff superb, and the service was out of this world. Great job, Austin Hilton!"
4,Expensive hotel room but great location,Nice hotel. Clean rooms and staff were very friendly. We were attending a conference at the hotel and had a room on the 22nd floor. The view was amazing. The pool and work out centre was great. No complaints other than the hotel is too expensive for what you get.
3,Hilton Austin great location but...,"Hilton Austin has an unbeatable location. If you are coming for SXSW and you want convenience, I cannot emphasize that this is the BEST location hands down. HANDS DOWN. Also the staff are so professional. But my toilet didn't flush and my mattress was indented... so, for the money, it kind of sucked. If I came to Austin for any other purpose other than SXSW, I would not stay here. But for SXSW, it was, unfortunately, the best choice and still is."
4,"GREAT location, service, amenities, restaurants, etc.","This is a great hotel and has all the things mentioned in my title. I was there for SXSW, so it's PERFECT for downtown 6th Street locations and walking to Rainey Street. Also, the rooms are nice, my floor was quiet, the food in the hotel (and Starbucks) are GREAT and the service is terrific. The rooms are nice (Hilton, so not uber-luxury but updated and clean, decent decor, large sink counter, etc.). They have a lot of amenities like overnight mail service, Starbucks/dining, parking, etc. I really enjoy this Hilton above others and the service and cleanliness are both great!"
3,Noisy Club Can‚Äôt Be Ignored,"I stay in Austin probably at least 2 times a month. This was my first stay at this Hilton in recent memory and unfortunately I don‚Äôt repeat. The team member at check in was friendly and helpful, they first had me assigned to one king room but he was able to find me a 2 queen bed room after I was able to show him my confirmation of the room. It is an accessible room so a little different than other rooms but it‚Äôs a solid room. Reviewers who comment the rooms are a little worn are correct but it doesn‚Äôt affect the stay, it‚Äôs a comfortable adequate room with a GREAT location. The real problem is the club noise from the street level. I am on a fairly high floor and at home I live in a busy urban area so ambient noise doesn‚Äôt bother me‚Äîbut this is a loud thudding bass that even my white noise app doesn‚Äôt cancel. I still have one more night here and hoping to just squeeze in some sleep after the club downstairs closes, praying for 2 am close."
4,Well Located,"The Hilton Austin is a very large facility (26 floors) adjacent the convention center. It is also just 3-4 blocks from the river, Congress Ave, 6th Street entertainment, and more. Large modern lobby, restaurants, Starbucks, fitness center, and more. Concierge level lounge was on 25th floor with plenty of food and snacks and great views at night. Rooms were nice enough."
5,Stay at Hilton,The staff was very friendly and professional. The room was clean and attended to.I was able to reach staff members at any time and any matters were resolved quickly. I would definitely stay there again.
4,Typical Hilton - large and noisy,"This is a typical large Hilton property. Rooms are on the smaller size as you might expect in a conference hotel. There is a Starbucks in the lobby that is super crowded. There is an Executive Lounge with very limited offerings, mostly it is a place to access wifi and get water bottles."
3,"Good, clean hotel - with a club next door","I was at this hotel for a business trip. The room was clean, the location was close to things without being in the middle of everything and generally I was fine with my 3 night stay. I am going to call the whole thing average. The wifi in my room was pretty fast (I had to pay for it, but still - fast is good for a business trip)HOWEVER, here are a few notes:- I was awakened at 1am on my business trip by incredible loud music outside. It turned out that this was a club (and apparently Houston has no noise ordinances? Or at least none the hotel was willing to use). The options the front desk was giving the 50+ people calling to complain was that they could move rooms. At 1 in the morning. So my tip would be to ask to stay on a side where the club isn't?- My rain shower (which I generally can't stand anyway) had VERY LITTLE water pressure. It took forever to get the shampoo out of my hair.- There was a constant buzzing noise in my room that was ever present.- The check-in person told me that if I signed up for Hilton Perks that I got free water in my room - but when I got upstairs the little bottle told me that was reserved for certain levels of Hilton Perks, which I obviously wasn't. I think that's pretty silly. Especially in a room that apparently doesn't give you any glasses either - so they are basically begging you to buy a $2.50 tiny water bottle?"
4,"Fast valets, slow food.","The hotel is well kept and the staff is extremely polite. Service at the bar and the ala carte breakfast is extremely slow. The valet parking is fast, courteous & efficient - lived up to the hype in others' reviews."
3,Rooms look dated!,Rooms look dated! Rugs were thread bare. Paint was coming off of different pieces in the bathroom. Bathtub issues. Plastic covering on top of old bathtub that bounced up and down as you moved around. Some old towels that you could almost see through. Staff was very nice. Lobby looked nice.
4,Solid and up to Hilton standards,"The Hilton lives up to its standards. It‚Äôs a good hotel in a great location. Service is very good, the restaurant is recommended for dinner. Breakfast is reasonably priced and has a good selection and made to order items. I stayed in a corner room, which was spacious, clean and had a coffee/tea maker and water. All in all an efficient and clean hotel well suited for a business stay."
1,Terrible property and terrible service,"Hilton used to be a descent hotel. No more. They are removed the most fundamental of requirements. Water in the room is for sale. Of course, it does not matter because there are no drinking glasses in the room. The coffee pot did not work; this was probably to drive business to the overpriced Starbucks located in the hotel. The room was noisy and the bed and pillows uncomfortable. I arrive back at my room at 4pm after being out all day and the room was not made up. I called housekeeping and nothing happened, so I called again. It took over an hour from my call to get the most rudimentary cleaning. I strongly recommend staying away from this hotel."
4,Great location!,This hotel is located right in the middle of everything making it ideal for those that don't rent a car. It is clean and well kept. Only drawback is that it is VERY large to accommodate the convention crowd. Elevators can back up and it is very busy.
4,Traditional Convention Type Hotel - Good not Great,"The Hilton Austin is a traditional convention style hotel. It's large, and most guests seemed affiliated with meetings or events. Nothing wrong with that, it just means it has a very generic vibe.The front desk service was also generic and nothing personalized about check-in, but I'm fine with quick and efficient....but I do remember hotel experiences by their ""personality and warmth"" as well.The rooms are reasonable, if not memorable. Standard but comfortable bedding, and nothing more to add about the rooms, really....well, except for...Both the shower faucet and toilet handle were broken when I arrived in my room. Doesn't housekeeping confirm the rooms are operable for the next guests, and advise maintenance if work needs to be done? That said, I was only mildly annoyed, as maintenance was quick and very friendly, and both items were operable soon enough. The responsiveness and friendly nature by Maintenance was notable.Location is adjacent to convention center, and a very short stroll to the music/nightlife/restaurant establishments and hangovers to be experienced on 6th Street. It's an easy and safe walk also to Congress Avenue and the Warehouse district....and downtown Austin is pretty small, in general.If you have free time when not enjoying music/drinks/eats, visit the Austin Library, which is a really great and fun community experience - it sorta blew me away. Also, the museums on the campus of the University of Texas are fantastic and renowned - the Harry Ransom Center (archive/library/museum; 2nd largest archive only to the US National Archive), the Blanton Museum (largest university museum in the USA), and LBJ Presidential Library are each extraordinary."
5,Great spot in Austin,"Just had an exceptional stay at the Hilton Austin! We had reached out to Anna, the Assistant Director pre-arrival and she was so helpful in an inquiry we needed assistance with. When we arrived Jeremy greeted us and his passion and energy was exceptional. He truly embodies the vision of Conrad Hilton with his hospitality. Each time he saw us in the lobby he was welcoming, warm and asked if we needed anything. He truly is a superstar. Interacted with Pamela over the phone and she was so engaging and helpful with a need we had. She asked how our stay was going and truly cared. We had executive lounge access and the entire team was going above and beyond for the guests up there. Each team member was truly exceptional and the hotel is great. My only gripe is I hate the smell of Lily‚Äôs and they have them in the lobby and foyer to exec lounge and it drives my allergies wild. If that‚Äôs the worst thing though they‚Äôre quite great at what they do. Thanks for another great stay and you should definitely choose the Hilton Austin for its convenience, charm and exceptional team next time you‚Äôre in Austin! Great job!!"
4,Good overall except for forced use of UPS store to accept package delivery,"Last I checked Hilton and UPS were separate businesses, so I'm a little peeved that I had to pay a $15 fee to have the UPS store receive a package when I was told by the concierge to have it delivered to the concierge desk and it would be sent to my room (with no mention of any fee)."
4,Good location downtown,I stayed here for a conference and I found the location to be centrally located and good for walking to nearby entertainment and restaurants. The rooms are pretty large and for the most part clean. The food is ok at the Taco restaurant downstairs but I would recommend guest explore the local restaurants in town.
5,Great hotel,"I Attended a work conference here last month. Very nice hotel, felt safe and all the staff who I encountered were very friendly. Check in and check out was such a pleasant and speedy process. Loved the location of the hotel. Plenty of things with in walking distance or a short Uber ride away. I was also impressed with the fitness area/spa. I would stay here again!"
5,"Great staff, wonderful location","A quick shout out to the staff and security officer Christopher Simmons who found my purse and alerted me within 15 minutes after I left it somewhere.I also had a great nights sleep, hot shower and satisfying breakfast. What more can you ask for?"
5,Great location!,"Great location to all downtown Austin attractions. Wonderful front desk with exceptional service. Views from the top floors of the city are beautiful. Rooms are comfortable. The Hilton honors lounge offers a great breakfast, coffee bar at all hours, evening hors d‚Äôoeuvres and drinks. Would definitely stay here again while in Austin."
4,"Nice hotel, right in the heart of Austin Downtown",I stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. I really have mostly +ve comments for this hotel.Staff is very friendly. Hotel is just 20+ minutes away from Austin Airport.The only issue I encountered which I did NOT report was the slow draining bathtub.
5,This is a great hotel!,"While it looks more modest form the outside, it's VERY nice on the inside and the rooms are terrific! Moreover, the staff are very personable, very nice and extremely helpful. I was surprised at how nice the rooms were, not that I should be but modern, comfortable, with ample room."
4,Conference location,Slightly dated; sky bridge to convention center; you can self park in basement garage with entry on 4 street; very nice pool area just off the spa - steam and dry sauna with lockers so you don‚Äôt have to ride the elevator in swimsuits or workout close. Two separate fitness Areas
3,Overall good but don't stay on the 24th floor,"I stayed here for two nights in January and each night was very different. The first night when we arrived, the staff seemed really cranky and generally un-friendly. We stayed on the 24th floor and above us there were what sounded like chairs being dragged across the floor starting at 2am. The shower also didn't seem to work very well, and to top it off, our next door neighbors started playing music so loudly that we decided to switch rooms.The staff who helped us switch rooms was much nicer. They said that above us was the executive suite, which explains the noise. The staff moved us to the 23rd floor and this was much better in terms of both noise and a better shower.In each room the beds were comfy and the A/C worked really well but the wifi seemed to have some issues in each room as well.I'm honestly not sure I would stay here again but definitely avoid the 24th floor."
5,business conference,"Great hotel in older part of town. Easy access to restaurants and bars, which were plentyful. Most places, within easy walking distance. Hotel doesn`t look so good from outside and hotel underground parking very smelly but once you get into the hotel, it`s beautiful."
4,Great staff and excellent food,"I used the gym regularly as well as the pool. Very clean and well equipped. The food at the restaurent was excellent for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The front desk staff were very polite and accomodating. The restaurant service was excellent and the chefs were great! Plating and food quality was over the top! Great value for the money paid."
5,"Great hotel, with great facilities","Recieved great service from the get go and had a great stay. Gym facilities were modern, pool and sauna facilities were great.Minor issue with assistance not getting back to me about a lost watch (Hilton Guest Assistance file 24662457)."
4,Good business hotel,Just as the title says: a very good business hotel. The rooms were nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Location of the hotel is also a positive point: nightlife just around the corner. An honorary mention for the breakfast: if was very good and divers with a chef behind the counter making egg dishes to order.Conclusion: very good business hotel and also nice for a short family stay (nice rooftop pool).
5,Wonderful hotel!!,"Upscale hotel, clean rooms. This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel for business. The front desk associates were so accommodating, friendly, courteous, and helpful. The room was spotless, smelled nice. The shuttle driver was so sweet to me when he brought me to the airport. He was such a gentleman and kind. Parking at the hotel was a breeze."
5,Excellent Security Service,"I attended a large conference there mid January and realized late one evening I‚Äôd misplaced my computer bag. When I called security at that time, Christopher Simmons informed me they had found my bag, provided great instruction on how to go about collecting my bag, and was there the next morning to bring it to me immediately after I talked to the front desk. Christopher also took care to allow me time to ensure all the contents were there. Great attitude towards satisfying the customer, especially in a stressful situation."
5,My stay was wonderful,"I have not reviewed this hotel in a while. I Frequent this hotel several times a year and as always, I'm never let down. The service level is always impeccable. The suite upgrades are spoiling I cant wait to get back here!!"
5,Great hotel great location,Very friendly and helpful staff as we arrived very late. Had forgotten a few travel amenities and staff provided the amenities quickly with s smile. Every single staff member from clerk's to wait staff to doormen we're genuinely kind and helpful.
2,Stay ruined by front desk service,"Room was standard, clean and efficient. Location was excellent. Treatment by the front desk staff on both check-in and check-out, however, was icy and rude. If they said two words, which they didn't until I tried to start conversations, was there a please, thank you, smile, or consideration for my experience. Arms were extended for credit cards, etc., without so much as a how do you do. I will do all in my power to never have to stay here again."
5,Spectacular Views and Service,We stayed here the weekend of 12/15-16/18 for a volleyball tournament next door in the convention center. We had a clean and comfortable room on the 22nd floor facing west with spectacular views of downtown. The staff were friendly and helpful and the valet parking was convenient. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The Austin Taco Project in the lobby was a fun supper at the end of the day. Would definitely stay here again.
5,excellent customer service,"This Hilton was amazing. The people I worked with were very helpful and friendly. PSAV's Chris and Allison were about the best i have ever worked with. They defiantly need to be thanked for their above and beyond service!I left some clothing in my room and called back. Chris Simmons in security was very helpful and shipped my clothing to me overnight!! Now that was above and beyond!Jennifer in the executive lounge was amazing as well. She is very efficient, friendly and service oriented. They all need to be commended"
5,Very Pleased With Our First Trip to Austin,"We stayed at the downtown Hilton for just two short days from January 2nd-4th of this year.PROSConvenient location- Located right in Downtown with lots to see and do and tons of those bird scooters all over. PLUS, there were some yummy food choices in the hotels including a Starbucks.Spacious Rooms- Sometimes you go to hotels in larger cities and they're tiny. Not the case of our room here. Tons of space between the beds and tv/desk area. Enough for a roll-up bed or an 8-year-old to do gymnastic moves across the floor.Quiet Rooms- The insulation between walls must almost be sound proof. Our kids fell asleep in the main area while my husband took a call in the bathroom with the door closed, you could hardly hear him. This also meant you could hardly hear any unsavory bathroom sounds ;)Freakishly Fast Elevators- These bad boys were dang efficient and could get you from the ground level to the 13th floor in like 8 seconds flat. When you signaled for one, it was only a matter of a few blinks before one was available.Ah-mazing Pool Deck- They had JUST finished the pool before our arrival and despite the 40-50 degree weather, the heated pool was comfortable for swimming. The hot tub was for sure nice.Ah-mazing Workout Facilities- There were two workout rooms available and also lockers, sauna, and steam room. The equipment was nice/clean and the room temperature was appropriate.Staff- Lastly, I want to call out the amazing staff. Pretty much everyone we interacted with was helpful and hospitable. I especially want to call out Presley for her helpfulness when we had questions at the front desk. (Side note: Debbie was ok...she could have been kinder)CONSParking Costs- It was $32/day to park but you kind of assume that with down town of a major city. It was easier to swallow once we realized daily public parking was even more.Need Bathroom Vents- Though quiet, the bathrooms had a special way of lingering smells. Maybe a vent or complimentary air freshener is in order?SUMMARYWe had an excellent stay and memorable time with our kids. The hotel has an excellent buffet (albeit pricey) and the pool/spa is a must do. Thank you Hilton Austin!"
3,Disappointed Guest,"I am a local resident here in Austin, recently got married and referred all of my guests to this hotel as I use to trust the Hilton name. After series of stories of our guests having minimal complaints I have my own that I would like to make.On our wedding night, we walk in with our wedding clothes on ie - dress and suit. The woman walks out from behind the wall and says, ""yeah"" and I kindly say, ""We'd like to check into our hotel room, we just got married!"" (with excitement). She tells me that she can't check me in that it's after hours. I apologize and say, ""we only need our keys we're already checked in - my sister came over this morning and checked us in."" She told me that she could not give us our keys to the hotel. As I look down at my wedding dress and say, ""you're kidding me, its my wedding night.."" She told me there wasn't anything she could do.....The only saving grace of the night was that when my sister checked us in earlier she gave my (now) husband the hotel keys and found them hidden in his pocket. I should not have had this conversation to begin with - but we thought we lost the keys with the whole getting married and running 100 mph.I will not send my guests that visit me to the Hilton in the future - not this one. The biggest night of our lives and she said she couldn't give me a key for a room that was paid for and already checked in. I additionally will not waste more time on this review by informing you the rest of the experiences our guests had.How to improve your services next time? Have customer service - theres a start."
4,Good Location!,"Stayed here for four nights. Convenient location close to all the action downtown (easy walking distance). Was around $20 for a Lyft to/from the airport. Spacious room, clean, and updated. Friendly lobby and cleaning staff. Good place to stay for the price."
3,The front desk agents were not pleasant. That really put a damper on my stay. The property is beautiful,The front desk agents were not pleasant. That really put a damper on my stay. The property is beautiful but I don't think I will be staying here again due to the staff. If the property had friendlier front desk agents then my stay would have been perfect but because of that I can't say that I will be returning.
5,18th Year Anniversary,"We loved our stay from start to finish. Pam who is in the guest services department made this stay extra special for us. She gave us executive passes to have breakfast and snacks in the evening each day we stayed. She even had a bottle of champagne brought up to our room to celebrate our anniversary. Hotel is very close to 6th street easy to walk back and forth. Just a warning.....parking fees are expensive, but as a Hilton Honors member a gentleman behind the counter did work with us to discount some of the parking fees. Thanks Hilton!!! We will back!!!"
4,Need more heat,"We stayed at this hotel 2 years ago. The bar was very mediocre. They have remodeled and now have a very nice bar with excellent selections, but lobby and bar area are cold. Even the staff is wearing coats and sweaters. I asked about it and was told that is the best heat they have. They need more in the lobby and bar areas for cold days like today.Rooms are very nice.Very nice hotel if they can just get more heat."
4,Great stay,"Great stay for the most part. Lots of construction on hotel entrance made things a little confusing on arrival. No smoking area provided for us. The 4th and 6th floor balconies had ashtrays and seating. These are the ballroom floors. Even though there were no events going on and the floors were empty, security still made us leave to smoke on the street."
3,Hot Tub Not Open,"The hot tub and pool area were under renovation when we arrived, but the completion date was listed as 2 days later. Unfortunately, they extended the date by a week 2 days later, so they did not manage the project effectively. Room furnishings are warn and broken. Service was subpar. There are many better options in town."
1,My Stay in December 2018,"Stayed for a company party, not worth it. We valet parked our car and it ended up having scratches on the hood. Stayed the night and it was quiet enough to relax. Woke up the next morning and tried to make coffee and the grounds from the previous guests were still there! Went to the complimentary breakfast on the 25th floor for a simple bagel. I tell you that the bagels at HEB are better if that gives you any indication. Still waiting on security to follow up on the damage to my car while it was valet parked. We will see."
5,Great choice in Austin,"Halfway between 6th St and Rainey. Quick ride to bars, restaurants and music venues. Bird scooters are a great way to get around.Hotel people very cordial and helpful. Room was front of hotel 13th floor and Saturday night music was noticeable but it's music city fer cry eye."
5,Tour of Texas volleyball,"Hotel was across street from tournament. From the checking in to check out, everyone was amazing. We had a concierge text us to make sure everything was as expected. Needed a blanket and after texting the request, we had it within minutes. we then had a follow up text to make sure we got it. Excellent service"
2,This venue is too big for personal services.,"This venue is huge and too big for personal services. Check in advance to discover if exercise and pool and spa services are operational. Fast elevators, nice shop within and restaurants as well. Good breakfast though."
5,Great Hotel and Hilton like I remember,"This Hilton has the service, cleanliness and comfort I remember from the days I was a diamond member in Hhonors. My last several Hilton stays were way below par but this hotel brought me back to the old Hilton standard and class.Nice staff, easy check in and quite comfortable stay."
5,Awesome hotel for large corporate events.,"Centrally located in the convention center area with easy access to the convention center. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby. The food at the break out sessions for breakfast, lunch and dinner was very, very good. Lots of meeting spaces. The staff was wonderful. Will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time I'm in Austin whether for business or pleasure."
4,Pleasant Stay,"Great hotel with friendly staff and tasty restaurants. I stayed here for 3 nights and was happy with the way I was checked in (fast and with bottled water). The rooms were clean, the conference areas were comfortable, and the location is fantastic."
5,Great location and service!,"This Hilton was in the BEST location. Walkable to the Capitol, Rainey Street, 6th Street; and a short drive/Lyft to South Congress and the hip East Austin neighborhoods. The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean and comfortable. There was a slight discrepancy on my bill which was resolved quickly and on the spot. Would definitely stay here again!"
5,Austin Strut,"My wife and I logged just over 20 miles of walking over 3 days. We had a blast, striking out in a different direction each morning. The art installations by the river are worth while. The only thing we missed was watching the bats at the Congress St Bridge."
5,A great choice in Austin,"The Hilton Austin is in the heart of downtown Austin. A modern hotel with contemporary decorated rooms. Automated lighting gives you access to all the lights in at the door upon entering the room and at bedside. If you have Honors Lounge privilege, you are in for a treat. With a generous breakfast and nice evening happy hour, the Hilton Austin is a great place to stay while visiting Austin."
5,prime location for fun,"Valet parking is not cheap but you also can just park your car in the parking of the hotel and it is free, so that is up to you, besides that it is street parking and here is not that easy and convenient as this hotel is located very close to the iconic 6th street.This is like a conference hotel kind. It is huge! there is a lot of people everywhere and it is a pretty busy hotel.The check in is a bit of a hustle as there's a lot of ppl in this hotel at all times. However the staff does make sure to be very personal and helpful so they litigate a lot the feeling of big hotel chaos.The lobby has a couple of bars and restaurants as well as a Starbucks and a souvenir shop. There's computers and plenty to sit around down in the lobby.The decor ie pretty nice and minimalistic and I appreciated that. Very good taste and flow.Now this hotel has one of the largest reasons why someone should make sure to use the points rewards and follow the loyalty. they have a Gold and up member lounge where they provide free breakfast and happy hour snacks so this is a great perk here, only Gold and up members have access to this perk.this hotel have outdoor pool and a nice hot tub as well, gym and a spa. lots of great amenities.the rooms are ok, very nice bed, I was pretty happy that there were plenty of outlets to charge my items.this hotel is located so close to 6th street is very nice and convenient to just go out and have some fun.the staff as I already mentioned is amazing, friendly and super helpful.this is a prime location to stay if you wanna come to Austin and have a lot fun in town."
3,Expected more....,"Arrived after a long flight,tried to overcharge us by$1000! Rectified after a time,however we had to prove the room rate we were charged during our booking process on The Hilton website,luckily I had my confirmation with me!Room ok had better executive rooms within the Hilton chain.Executive lounge very disappointing,staff lovely but food very poor during the evening service,breakfast was better. We upgraded using the offer,wasn‚Äôt worth it,in the States no free bar either so I would pass next time. No pool either but smashing pictures on the website with no visible notice it‚Äôs closed."
5,Bachelorette Weekend,"Our group of 15 enjoyed our stay at the hotel and didn‚Äôt want to leave! The staff was extremely helpful, courteous and accommodating! The hotel is centrally located and in walking distance to all of the places we wanted to visit!"
5,Highly recommend!,"We stayed in a double queen with 4 women and I was worried about how tight it would be. We actually had plenty of room. Our stay started out right with Jeremy checking us in. He was so friendly and always smiled and said hi when he saw us coming and going throughout our stay.The beds were very comfortable. One minor snafu is on our first morning we called for an extra towel as we were only provided with three and also asked for different pillows. The pillows are feather pillows and can be quite uncomfortable. We had to call twice and it took over an hour to get our towels. The rest of the time we always received 4 towels.The room was clean. We were on the 22nd floor and on the weekends could hear street noise. It didn‚Äôt keep us awake, but something to consider. We faced 5th st.The location truly can‚Äôt be beat! Highly recommend staying here!"
5,Excellent choice for downtown Austin,"Great service, helpful staff, and location close to UT, walking distance to restaurants, and the lake which provided easy access to outdoor running. I stay in Hilton branded hotels almost exclusively and this hotel is a great choice for personal or business use."
5,UT Family Weekend,The Hilton was absolutely wonderful! We have stayed several times.They have updated the lobby design overall. There are many seating groups with a variety of options. The restaurant bar is updated and the food/drinks were wonderful. They have a nice water station for guests.The rooms were perfect for the family and the Hilton was quick to bring additional towels needed for kid baths.The employees were so helpful and kind. Every time we had questions on locations or recommendations they had stellar restaurants and spots to visit.My 3 year old gets up early and we spent a ton of time between 6am-8am in the lobby. It was like our own breakfast spot and living room. The staff were accommodating and friendly when many would most likely not be excited about a small child spending time in the lobby.
5,Great place to stay for business or leisure,"Was there for a work trip and had limited free time, but there was plenty to eat, do and see within 10-15 minute walks. The staff were all so professional and friendly, and within a few days felt like they were all part of our team."
5,amazing staff!,I left an item behind in my room and needed it mailed back. The entire process was so easy and every person I spoke to from the security office was pleasant and helpful. I could not speak higher of the staff here.
5,Great place to stay!,The Hilton Austin is a great place to stay. The hotel staff is very friendly. I was there when the city of Austin had a water ban. The hotel provided bottled water freely. Close to the convention center. Nice rooms. Highly recommend!
5,Such a great hotel,"The Hilton Austin is located in the perfect spot. We walked to the Texas football game from our room, and after the game we were in the heart of Austin nightlife for some great restaurants and live music. We also love being so close to the ladybird trail because it‚Äôs so great to get up and run alongside the river in the morning. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable, and the hotel pool and gym are incredible. What I like most about this Hotel though is the staff. The employees go out of their way to make your stay special. From the cleaning crews to the hotel receptionist, they are always extremely helpful and courteous. We had such a great experience with Ashley at the front desk; she remembered my name, she was extremely friendly to our dog who loves traveling with us, and she goes out of her way to make our stay the best experience! She really made us feel special and we appreciate how friendly the staff treated us. If you want a great hotel in an amazing location, I‚Äôd highly recommend the Hilton Austin."
4,"Nice property, can be loud late night","Nice room, clean. Little on the higher cost side. Stayed on 21st floor. Music was loud both nights until 2am (windows shaking) from either outside or possibly at the hotel. But, heating system quiet, so overall a good night. Self park in their ramp is $31/night..."
2,Avearge at Best,"The hotel check in was slow, the elevators were slow. The room was small to average. No real feel to them. I would rather stay at a Holiday Inn Express for 1/2 the cost. The bar area and food were average at best."
2,Disappointed for a Hilton,"We stayed there for a wedding this weekend and I had a couple of issues with the hotel. I'm so disappointed because the fact that this is a HILTON, I was expecting a lot more from this hotel. Our original room had to be changed because there was a cockroach in our room. I freaked out and called the front desk for a room change. The room was changed no problem. But it wasn't until I went downstairs (by pure chance my mother in law was talking to the front desk about an unrelated credit card issue) and the guy at the front desk asked what they could do to remedy my situation, after my mother in-law suggested a discount, only then were we given the room at half price. I also had issues after checking out. A hold was put on my credit card (all charges should've gone to my mother in laws credit card) and the manager Jasmin just gave me the runaround when trying to give me an explanation... among other issues is the fact that the towels we were given were stained, the elevator lobby smelled like they hadn't taken the garbage out in days, they have homeless people walking through the lobby... This is a Hilton hotel, for the price they charge I was expecting A LOT more. Overall I was extremely dissatisfied and will probably never stay at a Hilton ever again. Do better Hilton Austin."
4,Good Business Hotel,"Good business hotel close the the center of Austin. Modern and clean, and very close to 6th street with it's bars and restaurants. The staff was very good. They were very friendly and professional. I would stay here again for business."
5,Great Location,"Connected to the convention center and 1 block from the famous 6th street. Modern and hip hotel. Check in was easy and front staff were professional and friendly. Lively bar along with decent Taco restaurant on site. They make a good drink. Rooms were decent size and decorated okay not great. Great digital pad to control room temperature and lights was very, very convenient. Front driveway area is small so at busy times valet can be a challenge. However, valet crew were friendly. Will return."
5,HomeAway Conference,A very nice stay at the Hilton downtown Austin. The lady in the executive lounge was very nice and went out of her way to assist us in trying to find our game on TV. We would definitely stay her again as the hotel is in great location.
5,Overall great experience,I enjoyed my time at Hilton Austin. I want to send a special shout out to the lady in the executive lounge who is from Mauritius. She went above and beyond her typical set of duties as she tried to get us the channel that we wanted for the ball game and did. Great job to make sure the snacks and drinks are replenished. The room is spacious and location of the hotel is excellent as well.
5,Fantastic,"Ty Joyce and Leann for superbüòãservice well done Hilton, Bonny and I were treated wonderfully by your entire staff . What a sweet touch for our anniversary, dinner and drinks! This is why you choose Hilton! Top notch service, food and our room was super ! Ty to all !! Was fantastic!"
5,Great Experience!,"A little weekend away from the kids so we checked out this Hilton and wow, impressive! Utilized the Diamond level status in the Executive Lounge for some drinks before dinner. Rooms were comfortable up on he 24th floor and hotel was easy access to central downtown Austin. Checked out Moonshine Grill, which is directly behind the hotel and what started as a 2-hour wait at 7, finished with 2 seats at the patio bar. Hotel was great and will definitely check out this spot again."
5,Hilton Austin - Excellent,My love of the city of Austin is almost as intense as my love of the Austin Hilton. The staff was excellent and bended over to help me. The new Taco joint was perfect for a wuick lunch and every thing on th menu was delicious.
5,Awesome location and customer service,This hotel is in a great location and the customer service is awesome. We were so happy with our weekend away! The pool area was perfect for us to hang out and the drinks were delicious. Really enjoyed the size of the bathroom - we were four girls in one hotel room and all fit in the bathroom comfortably to get ready each day (this can be key for some girls :) )
4,The hotel was very good for business trips,The hotel was very good. We enjoyed continental breakfast eapecially scrambled eggs at execuitve lounge for elite members. Fitness rooms are impressive and there they offer comp infused water with lemon and berries at gym. Delicious refresher! Hotel room with highway view was not bad.
5,Excellent stay!,"My family of 3 recently spent 4 nights here while my husband attended a conference. We had an excellent stay! When we booked we asked if they had microwaves available and were told ""maybe depending on availabilty"". When we arrived, (we were allowed to check in early!) the microwave was already set up in our room. We were given a room at the end of the hallway which seemed to be a little bigger than the others which was great with a 2 year old! The room was very clean and comfortable. We did not hear any hallway noise or neighbor noise the whole stay. The first evening we were delivered cookies and milk for our daughter which she really enjoyed! Thank you for making our stay memorable!"
5,Excellent choice for conference stay,"Staff polite and helpful, room immaculate and modern (excepting the ancient iPhone docking station without lightening type connect!) Suggestion - the sad little coffee makers really need to be changed out to Nespresso or Keurig.Forget view. Even if you‚Äôre facing the lake there‚Äôs a huge building in the way. That direction you look down on the conference center next door.Room insulation wonderful - never heard a neighbour.Was not really impressed with restaurant options.Fortunately the executive lounge however was spotless, well stocked and morning staff (Jennifer) a delight. (In contrast to the evening middle aged lady who never cracked a smile and needs to learn some social skills. This was in contrast to every other member of staff I came across during a whole week at this hotel.She is not going to dock a star on this rating however as I had an excellent stay and will book again next visit."
2,"Nice location, but expensive and noisy","Came here for a company gathering. It's right near the center of Austin, so it is great for location. The rooms did not seem all that grand for the price. Doors were scuffed and hardware in the bathroom seemed loose. Could not find a dial for the refrigerator so our leftovers froze."
3,Decent but not spectacular,"We were in town for a convention and I tagged along. The people at the front were friendly, smiling and accommodating. When we reached the front desk, we did not have the same experience. The person that checked us in was polite but had no eye contact with us and did not smile. We were given a room that overlooked downtown Austin and it‚Äôs 6th street. The room was smaller than others we have stayed in, but clean. There were no robes, and bath towels were limited to two. The sink made a noise when the cold water ran. We did have access to the executive lounge. There is not much or a assortment and wine or beer are at a charge. I did go up during the day for waters and nuts as a snack.I used the outdoor pool everyday. It‚Äôs decent size and there is a jacuzzi. It is on the 8th floor with a gym and spa."
4,Quiet Comfortable Room,"Quiet and I could sleep. Decent Room. Good selection of TV channels. Shower is Low-Flow which was disappointing. Hotel is in the heart of Down Town Austin. Night Life, Great Restaurants and Bars in walking distance."
4,Big but a bit dull,"Three nights at the Hilton Austin. Good service, comfortable room, though with beds it would have been kinder to have had two armchairs not one, when there was plenty of room. But the hotel is rather characterless. It has one lobby bar, good service but with little character. Two casual places to eat, but luckily the location is surrounded by places to eat and drink. The executive lounge is small and - apart from the good view - had nothing to recommend it. Breakfast of scrambled eggs every day with not even bacon to ring the changes. There are much better Hilton‚Äôs."
4,"Great room, not so great Exec Lounge","Overall my stay was great. Comfy room, quiet floor. This property would've gotten a 5 Star rating if the food in the executive lounge wasn't so bad. The eggs were not very good, looked processed. Not much in the way of selection at breakfast. I've had better meals at lower tier Hilton brands elsewhere."
5,Absolutely PERFECT Location,"Great location, wonderful helpful staff....I couldn't even think of asking for anything better. We walked all over Austin and everything was close to our hotel. The room and bed were comfortable and very clean."
3,Beware of homeless,No hotel shuttle so plan to take uber or Lyft. Homeless can be aggressive in this downtown area. It is not the hotel‚Äôs fault but that if the city of Austin. 6th Street entertainment and the convention center are very conveniently located within walking distance.
5,"Good Location, Clean and Accommodating",Location of this Hilton is great for walking to many places and restaurants inAustin. Visitor center is right around the corner. Very clean. Housekeeping is flexible when they clean your room. Very prompt when asked for extra pillows.They are experiencing a boil water advisory inAustin and the Hilton is providing more than enough bottled water to people staying here as well as guests coming in for conferences. Free at the bar also unlike at The Driskill who charge for their water even though you can‚Äôt drink the tap water!! Would definitely stay here again if in Austin.
2,Meh!! Drops the ball on the details.,"Came here for 3 nights on a business trip. The location is convenient to the convention center and its within a few blocks of some good restaurants and bars. The room was fine.As a business traveler, I don't have the time or patience when a hotel drops the ball multiple times. So let's start with the minor complaint ... no shampoo in the room. Took a call to fix that.Let's move to my biggest complaint. I have so far ordered room service 3 times, and to put it bluntly, the food stinks despite the exorbitant prices.First day I ordered some eggs, coffee and OJ. The manager told me it would be 20-25 minutes. So I decided to wait for my food before showering and getting ready to go. Almost an hour later, I was still waiting for my food and had to chase it down with multiple phone calls. I wound up late at my conference. The eggs were fine, but they put the toast in plastic wrap. You don't have to go to a culinary institute to know that toast packed in plastic wrap comes out a doughy and inedible. They did not have any white bread. I ordered Rye bread, but the bread itself was terrible. I asked for a credit on the $40 breakfast and they gave it to me.Day two, I ordered a veggie omelette, this time with uncovered toast. They got the toast part right this time, but I don't think the omelette was made with real eggs, or they make them early in the morning and then just add the filling. Another $40 crappy breakfast.Finally, I decided to order lunch. Austin is supposed to be a progressive town. There is not a single vegetarian or pescetarian friendly sandwich on the menu, and almost no vegetarian options on the menu except Margherita pizza and a green salad. I ordered the Margherita pizza. One would think that for $40 for a pizza lunch they would make some effort to make a good pizza. Just horrible. I did not finish it. Bland, under-cooked yuck!! I certainly could make something much better at home.Would not stay here again."
5,Wonderful Hotel,"This was a great hotel for a family trip. The staff was great including the front desk, restaraunt, and bar. There is a Starbucks in the lobby ad was a great meeting place for everyone. Hotel is in a central location for things downtown."
5,Convenient location.,Had two night stay in Hilton Convention Center. Super convenient - cross the street to the Convention Center where our conference is. And walking distance to bars and restaurant. The service is also very welcoming.
4,Hilton Downtown Austin,"Next door to the convention center where I attended a conference and only one street over from the 6th street action.The hotel staff is probably the most friendly staff I have ever encountered to date. Until recently, I have been a Diamond Hilton HHonors member since 2001 with several hundreds of stays and have been a guest at Hilton branded hotels around the world. I don't travel much in the last couple of years and my status is only Silver now for the first time since the early 2000s.The room was nice, fresh and modern and it included a cool pad to control the room lights, temp and more. Wifi was okay but I have been previously spoiled with always getting premium.I didn't have wheels so parking wasn't a consideration for me until the last night when I decided to rent a motorcycle. The hotel didn't charge me full pop as it was a bike which was greatly appreciated!!!What i did NOT like...I got a room right next to the elevator and it was noisy. My HHonors profile clearly indicates away from the elevator and this wasn't a last minute booking.I paid extra ($50 more per night) to be on the Executive floor and it was NOT worth it.However, the room control tablet was connected to the room heat/cooling system, was annoying as it kept clicking on and off ALL night long.Not the hotel's fault, but as a smoker, you couldn't go 10 feet outside except near the valet area without getting pestered by homeless people.All in all, a beautiful hotel but very expensive and not really worth the extra money in my opinion. I will be back next year and will stay at the Hampton or Embassy Suites..."
3,AFG conference,"This is a big hotel and are too busy to provide good service. I did an echeck in but my room wasn't ready. 1/2 hour it still wasn't ready and was the told it would be another hour to an hour and a half. On the 2nd day my keys didn't work. At check out, the line was long and took over 20 minutes. The front desk employees seemed overwhelmed and indifferent."
4,Good downtown location,"Good location for downtown business. Short walk to other downtown locations, directly across from the Austin Convention Center. Large hotel with plenty of conference space. Rooms have ample electrical outlets, good cable TV and high-speed WiFi. Excellent 24-hour Hilton Honors lounge with extensive daily continental breakfast. Attentive front desk staff."
5,A great hotelnina great location.,"A very quick and efficient check even though there was a large queue when I arrived.A large but comfortable lobby with gift shop, UPS mail, Starbucks with ample and relaxing waiting area too.Rooms as usual in a Hilton are excellent and some great views over the City too.Once outside exploring Austin you will find all the tourist areas are only a very short walk away.There is a pool and Spa too but I‚Äôm too busy out in the City to try the Spa so can‚Äôt comment on it. But if it‚Äôs up to usual Hilton standards then it will be great!Have fun!"
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"This hotel deserves all of the accolades they receive. I stayed three days and every member of staff that I came in contact with was smiling, welcoming and professional. It is the type of service you normally only receive at five diamond hotels. For a convention center hotel who also has a multitude of their own conference rooms, this felt like a boutique hotel experience. I had meals at both on-site restaurants (Cannon + Belle and Austin Taco Project) as well as ordering room service twice. I also used their app to ask for late checkout and I received an instant response."
1,Do not stay here,"Horrible experience. When I arrived, they told me that they were overbooked and had to go to another hotel (I thought only airlines did stuff like that). When I came back two days later, they made me wait 4 hours before the room was ready and the room they gave me smelled like cigarettes. When I asked for a different room they say they were fully booked.Not awesome. Actually one of the worst experiences in a while. Thanks Hilton!"
5,AMAZING Hotel!,"Hilton Austin made my stay in Texas a great experience! The staff is AMAZING! They made sure I received my full benefits as an Hilton Honors member without me having to ask and went above and beyond. Definitely recommend! You'll enjoy your stay. Also very close to great restaurants, shops and fun sights!"
5,Wonderful Hilton,Austin Hilton was a great experience. Received a wonderful upgrade to a beautiful suite. The staff was amazingly accommodating and the location was very good. Enjoyed the very comfortable bed and excellent breakfast. Surprised to find such an all round great Hilton in the US.
2,"Upset about lack of functional, quiet, working space","As a young professional that works from home and travels, I often find myself working and making Skype calls frequently within the hotels I stay at. Unfortunately, I was very upset to find there was no option at all for a quiet space to do work. The hotel offers a business area in the front lobby but as a main thoroughfare it is almost impossible to do work or make a call. I really wish there had been a free quiet space available for professionals like myself that choose to spend their short stay with the Hilton."
3,Beds are hard as a rock -,"I stayed here for a business trip and paid extra to be on the executive level. Our room was large and view was nice but our bed was as hard as a rock, when I asked the hotel to help us they sent an extra foam pad for bed, but it did not help at all. I was very disappointed by the experience we had and won't ever stay here again - The only good thing in my opinion is the location to convention center - Won't be back -"
5,Great location,"The hotel is located on the airport grounds. It offers 24 hour transport. They have a bar, restaurant, and Starbucks. Rooms are spacious and beds are large. We ate at the restaurant and the food was very well prepared, with great staff. The staff at check in were very helpful and very nice. We stayed in a room with two queen beds. The room included a coffee maker, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. We also requested a refrigerator and one was delivered to the room. I will definitely stay again if I have an early flight."
5,excellent hotel and service,"The room was clean, hotel lobby very nice, and great location. Also, there is a large Starbucks right off the lobby. I accidentally left a freezable lunch box in the room refrigerator...when I called to inquire, they assured me they'd mail it back (it arrived today). I really appreciate the extra service. We did not go to the restaurant, so I can't review that, but the conference area was great and made for an enjoyable business trip."
4,Classy hotel,"I stayed here for a conference next door at the convention center. Great location, literally right across the street from convention center. It's also one block away from 6th street. A fairly large starbucks in the lobby along with two nice restaurants. Our room was nice, mini fridge and nice TV. The room was clean, furnishings seemed new. Beds were not especially comfortable, but were adequate. As with any hotel, be sure and join Hilton Honors for free Wi-Fi and two bottles of water when you check in. Parking here is expensive, $30 for self and $41 for valet."
5,Excellent hotel and a great location,"This hotel has it all. Super location with great access to restaurants and bars. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with a great view of downtown. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool is extremely nice, and the spa/fitness center is nicely equipped with an abundance of machines. We didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel but did spend some time in the bar area and had great service. You literally can walk to a number of great bars and restaurants in the area."
5,wonderful.,Great hotel in the perfect nightlife location. Drinks a little spendy but super service made up for it. Comfy beds and spacious rooms. Was upgraded to a corner with a spectacular Austin view. Highly recommend the Austin Hilton.
5,"Great location, service and amenities","The hotel is a block from 6th Street and many points of interest. My favorite part of the hotel was the rooftop pool, just wish the bar had been open. We had a room on the execute level, 25th floor. Loved our view and the room. We ate breakfast and snacks in the executive lounge every day and the food service in the lounge was well above average. We ate in the hotel lobby bar and the pizza was one of the best I've ever had. My only complaint, as with many Hilton hotels now, is the AC being motion activated. So, if you've been gone all day and come into the room, it's really warm, until you activate the motion sensor. Same thing when sleeping at night. Admittedly, the setting at which it would switch on automatically was cooler than the last few Hilton properties we've stayed at, I just really dislike this feature in hotel rooms."
5,Girls' Weekend,"We were in Austin for a girls weekend. Had a great experience at the Hilton Austin. Location is great and service within the hotel is top notch. Restaurants on property offered good options, with yummy food!"
5,Austin First Timer,"I enjoyed this hotel immensely. It was centrally located to everything I wanted to experience. The restaurant/bar in the lobby was adequate but since there's so much around the area, I ate at other places during my stay. There's also a full Starbucks in the lobby which was a great surprise. The staff was great and accommodated my every request. I'd gladly stay there again."
5,Great location and superb hotel,"The location is awesome, you can walk to many points of interest, their lobby bar is more than a typical lobby bar and their restaurant serves flavorful food!If you are going to Austin! Go for it! The service firm bell boy to cleaning ladies is kind and helpful."
4,fabulous views and convenient location,Stayed here for a business trip to Austin. The Executive Lounge on the 25th floor was a nice perk. Everyone was very pleasant and eager to be of service. I had a shower handle mishap and it was repaired before I returned sightseeing one day which was prompt. The views were spectacular of downtown. Comfy bed and clean room.
5,Great Stay at the Hilton Austin,The hotel staff were great. They saw to every request and exceeded my expectations. I came in a day early and didn't have a reservation for the first night. They accommodated me even though the hotel was very full. They even upgraded my room to the executive level
5,Highly Recommend!!,Beautiful hotel. Clean. Professional staff. Very accommodating. Food was excellent at lobby bar and in the Taco restaurant attached to the hotel. Location is perfect for venturing out into Austin. Worth every $$
4,Expensive but conclusive,"This Hotel in Austin is just a block away from the dirty six. It is also adjacent to the convention center & downtown train station, so commuting is easy. Starbucks is on the ground level, cannon + belle & taco project for some dine & booze options. Overall, completely satisfied with my stay."
4,Great location. Excellent service.,Rooms were clean. Location perfect. Food was not typical over-priced hotel food. Shrimp and grits were delectable. Cornbread with bacon/butter was a hit as were all other items ordered over the stay. üëç
4,A great location.,"This hotel is situated right in the heart of food and entertainment. Very close to 6th Street, but not so close that you hear the noise. High end restaurants and low end dives, all within a few blocks. As well as the bat bridge. The staff is quick and courteous. Rooms are fine and with a view. This is a great spot to explore the area and have some fun."
4,No Bats ü¶á,"I went to Austin to visit an old friend and to see the Bats under Commerce bridge, which it had been raining the past week, I saw 5. There were hundreds of disappointed people including myself. We found out it is better to see them when it is dry. My friend arrived at the hotel first, they let me know the room is nice and comfortable, which it was very nice. Good location, only a couple blocks from Commerce bridge and a lot of other places close including 6th street which is only 2 blocks away. Be prepared, if you have a car, parking can be pricey. My only disappointment was the breakfast, for the price per night, I really expected a full buffet which it wasn‚Äôt, just the basic fruit, cereal and coffee."
4,A bit off!,"The rooms are great, with good electronics and comfy beds, but the bar service is questionable! Closes on Saturday at midnight and no French fries in the building! UT football weekends mean a full hotel with fun loving fans!"
5,Great hotel. Walk to everything.,"Truly enjoyed the Hilton Austin. Great location... walk to everything including 6th Street, Rainey Street, South Congress, State Capitol, ‚ÄúBat Bridge.‚Äù Was in town for USC Trojans at Texas Longhorns Football game. As a Hilton Diamond, I definitely appreciated the Executive Lounge. And thanks for honoring a late check out."
5,Great Convention Location,"My group just completed a four day meeting at the Hilton and everyone raves about the service and catering. I gained four pounds, need to work that off! My room on the 21st floor was clean and quiet. Housekeeping forgot to refresh the coffee one day but a quick call and they took care of it right away. Other than that I was very satisfied. The in house restaurant, Cannon & Belle is outstanding, one of the best hotel restaurants I have ever dined in. I will review separately. I‚Äôd be thrilled to stay here again!"
5,"Gorgeous property, lovely staff, cool bedside controls","After a tough journey in, Bruce was lovely helping me get checked in efficiently and settled so my brain would be ready to unpack and rest and be ready for my conference that started 6 hours later The rooms were sumptuous. Two queen beds, fridge, only missing a microwave. I unpacked and went to sleep (bedside control meant I didn‚Äôt have to get up to turn off the individual lights! The bathroom was well equipped - rain shower and hair dryer with high quality towels. The conference space was comfortable. A little cool in the crowd since the speaker was under lights The food was fine - not great for vegans but good for gluten free and unable to change but room service is available."
5,Best location,"This hotel stepped up with modern communication. Love that I chose my room, they text me recognizing i was silver and just made everything seamless. In a addition the hotel was really cool... great lobby, decor and the room was huge with an insane view!"
2,Many mistakes. Some of them ours.,"Mistake #1 - Ours I usually make all the hotel reservations in our family and when I do, I always book directly from the Hilton website. This time, for reasons unimportant here, my husband handled our accommodations, for us and for another couple. He thought he was dealing directly with Hilton, but no - he'd been drawn in by a 3rd party site. And he'd prepaid for both rooms in full. By the time I realized the mistake - the next day - it was too late to cancel without paying a $90 fee per room. Okay, fine. So it wasn't a huge surprise when we tried to check in and found out the hotel was overbooked and we were being sent elsewhere. That's the risk with 3rd party reservations. No worries, they said at the front desk. They'd drive us to the Fairmont to spend one night and then pick‚Ä¶"
4,Excellent for a Conference,"This hotel was really great, the meeting space is easy to navigate, the front desk staff is super and friendly and efficient and the Austin Taco Project is awesome. It was also great to have a Starbucks right in the hotel. It is conveniently looked and if the weather was not so horrible it would be great to walk outside."
5,GREAT location and property,"Located one block off 6th and walking distance to all the restaurants downtown, this hotel made our visit over a long weekend one to remember! Rooms were a bit on the small size but more than sufficient for the two of us."
5,Wonderful Place,Me and my family stayed there and it was so amazing we got an upgrade room in the 24th floor it was so nice and we were able to see it all the skyline everything I was so amazed on how cool it was but the sad thing was that my family didn ªt get to stay long because we came one day late and that really sucked.
4,Wonderful Getaway,We stayed in a upgrade room in the 22nd floor it was nice we were able to see the city skyline when we entered the toilet was constantly running when we hadn‚Äôt used it . It was a easy fix the staff and location is absolutely wonderful we walked EVERYWHERE the bars restaurants and small shops. The valet is definitely worth the money because you still get in and out privileges. We had a great short planned weekend vacation
3,Nothing special about this property,Nothing special about this location poor service in executive lounge. 4 days of Mushroom tarts. Save you money cheaper hotels on the same block and same parent company. Had people running floor to floor all hours of the night. Pillows were bad.
5,City Break,Hotel is brilliant. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great location - 5mins from 6th Street where the bars and restaurants are. Rooms are spacious and clean. Beds are comfy too! We had a view of the skyline too which was pretty too. Valet service are efficient. All in all - I had a great stay!
5,Great stay,"I was here for a few days for a convention on site. Start with parking - very easy to access the lot (underground garage) - elevators to and from parking were fast. Check in was quick and they had a room for me a few hours early. Great room - clean, quiet, nice view of sixth street. Service was impeccable - everyone was friendly and helpful. I didn't use a ton of the onsite amenities. Within walking distance to Rainey Street and 6th Street - you'll not have to worry about finding great food or entertainment nearby."
5,MLSP Live the Dream 9 EVENT,"Traditional hotel in favor with Austin. In the heart of Austin just of 6th street. Room was open for a standard type, comfortable king size bed. Bar and restaurant were great and not over priced. Front desk was very on point."
5,"Fab hotel, fab service, fab location","Wonderfully located, immaculate rooms and a fab roof top pool. Couldn‚Äôt fault it although wish we hadn‚Äôt been woken up early on our last morning by housekeeping when check out wasn‚Äôt for several hours...)"
5,Fantastic facility and wonderful staff!!,"Attending a conference for the week. The staff welcomed me at the door, checked me in right away, and gave me lots of helpful insights. They have been very responsive to any requests and made this stay the best I have had at any hotel in years. I will absolutely be back to this location anytime I am in Austin. Could not recommend any more highly. The Hilton Austin does things right!!"
5,Working,"Hotel was great, conveniently located across from the conference center. The room was clean, staff very friendly I was greeted before reaching the check in desk. The pool was nice, plenty of chairs. Short work trip but I felt very comfortable"
4,Great Hilton property for Austin,The Hilton Austin is an ideal Hotel central to everything Austin has to offer in the downtown area. It also has a nice rooftop pool and very well equipped fitness center next to the pool. The executive Lounge was good. Great facilities overall with a Starbucks on site. The staff was very professional.
3,Disappointing,"I‚Äôm really surprised by all the good reviews for the Hilton Austin, my experience was quite the opposite.While the foyer is clean and modern the opposite can be said for the rooms. They have not been well looked after. The first room we were given was small, had large carpet stains, splatters on the bathroom mirror, dirty hand smears down the artwork in the room. When I could hear a quiet conversation from the interconnecting room I asked to move rooms. The next room was an improvement, a corner room which was larger.I was still surprised about the poor cleanliness and upkeep of the room. Housekeeping were terrible, I had to call each day to have the room cleaned else it wouldn‚Äôt be done. One day when the bedding was replaced, it was with stained sheets - nice. We had laundry service done which wasn‚Äôt returned in the agreed timeframe. When following this up they couldn‚Äôt have cared less.There is a rooftop pool that makes for a refreshing swim. Although it‚Äôs very small, there is no shade and it gets packed.In short, pros - lobby, Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries and the location. Cons - service, rooms, cleanliness and the pool. For a hotel I was looking forward to, this fell very short."
1,Very pricy for very little.,"I paid about $350 for 1 night, on the club level. I am Hilton Gold, but have yet to have any upgrade. It was the middle of the week, so I thought, maybe this is my chance. The guy checking me in made up what appeared to be a lie on the spot: ""We are not very booked so we are deep cleaning our suites."" Literally the day before they had them available. No recognition of the status, no ""Welcome to Hilton."" The club lounge was pretty pathetic. It felt like detention with the servers having to lock and unlock the ""honor"" bar of screw off top wine. The breakfast (which I was supposed to be offered at check in but wasn't) was disgusting institutional eggs. The coffee machine was broken. The robes in the room were too small (I am a women's size 12). There are a LOT of choices in Austin. Will not stay here again."
5,Wonderful Staff,This was a great hotel for a family get together. The staff was great not only at the front desk but in the restaurant as well as the bar. Having a Starbucks in the hotel proved great for a family gathering place at all times of the day.
4,Much improved,"The first time I stayed here it was a HUGE epic fail on every level. I wanted to give them another opportunity as I do like how large the gym is and all the options. That‚Äôs important to me. Great rooftop pool with great view. They got my special accommodation correct before I checked In which is needed. The bed is comfortable and don‚Äôt hear much noise outside the room. Views are great and executive lounge was excellent. The staff is very friendly. This is a huge hotel and frequents conventions, so know that it is very busy all the time. Getting down at check out and valet is difficult if in a rush, just plan ahead. Know anywhere downtown Austin the parking is expensive so this is typical charge. I will be returning again for work when it‚Äôs within budget.I have to give props to the turn down service who went the extra step. It was a nice surprise."
5,"Great stay, great service","Every time I stay, it's been a great hotel and great service. The location is great too, next to convention center, close to restaurants, 6th, Rainey and the path along the river. The amenities are good too, Starbucks and Austin Taco Project are great."
3,Perfect for your corporate trip!,"Hilton Austin is part of a large chain. Rooms are standard. WiFi, valet, restrooms, indoor and outdoor seating. Just what you need on a corporate trip! There is a pool as well as restaurants and bars. Some rooms have a great city view"
5,Our party was a hit!,I booked here for a bachelorette party and it was amazing. Our room that I had e checked into wasn‚Äôt ready at three but we all just went and got our nails done while we waited. The lobby was beautiful. When we got to our rooms they had put in a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in each room for our bride. A perfect way to start our bachelorette weekend. We were on the 24tg floor and the view was spectacular. After a night out on 6th Street room service was great and my bed was very comfortable. All the staff was very pleasant they do a fantastic job.
5,Great stuff and city view,"First,Miss Vandijk in reception was very friendly and professional .Room was extremely Clean . View was amazing.Extraordinary Location in heart of downtown.Valet parking and many garages around .Restaurants and shops all around . One block to 6th street Restaurant and Bars"
5,Great hotel and location,"I was in Austin for a conference and chose this hotel due to it's proximity to the convention center. It's literally a stones throw from there. You are also within walking distance to lots of great restaurants in the area, as well.The hotel has an amazing fitness center, as far what you normally get at hotels. They have a restaurant in the hotel that serves small plates which makes for great sharing with friends. The rooms are nice and nicely set up for a business traveler."
5,Second visit and just as good,"We stayed two nights in August 2018 with a larger party than the prior visit. While we skipped the executive floors, we were more than happy with the city view skyline rooms we picked. Check in was breeze with the mobile app and staff at hand with text. The hotel has gotten customer service down to a science / art, like no other we have seen in Texas. We love the complimentary breakfast, parking and WIFI included deal. The breakfast and parking alone are worth it. The parking garage is easily accessible with in and out privileges. The renovated lobby is gorgeous and the Cannon and Belle restaurant which was not present on our previous visit is a delight. We had minor issues with room access but we got help within a few minutes from the staff and Victor figured out the issue. The business center is well appointed with Macs and Lenovo PCs. I used their printers as well and it was easy. There is a UPS store on site as well as a Starbucks and a new taco place. What more could you ask for in downtown Austin? Cheers to Brian, Brittney, Teresa, Alania, Houda and the team for making our visit memorable!!!"
4,"Very nice view, perfect location",The Hilton is located in the heart of downtown Austin within walking distance of many restaurants. Within the hotel there‚Äôs a Starbucks and two bars. The lobby is very huge with lots of seating. There‚Äôs paid valet and paid self parking which is the norm for Downtown. I was upgraded to a room with a very nice view of downtown. Very nice touch with the bedside remote to control the lights and temperature. Lots of power outlets and USB outlet by the bed to charge your phone.Wish the lighting was a little bit brighter in the bathroom but other than that bathroom was very clean with modern fixtures including a cool spa-like square shower-head. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.
1,"Shady ""incidentals"" charges?","We just checked in - and were charged $50 per night for ""incidentals"".Supposedly we'll get that back. It sounds shady - and assume we won'tget it back. I never like the feeling of being ripped off - or evenpotentially ripped off.I've never pre-paid an ""incidentals"" charge in my life. Well, thecredit card company will cover it if there's any discrepancy. The bestpart: I said I didn't want to pay the incidentals charge. The Hiltonrep responded: We can still cancel your reservation (in a fake-helpfulvoice of course)."
5,Great Family Staycation in Austin,"Fantastic hotel. Great service by front desk and hotel staff. Excellent proximity to conference center, 6th street and nightlife. Fantastic view from the rooms and 8th floor rooftop pool. Super fitness center and restaurants/bars and Starbucks on site!"
5,Convenient to everything we wanted to do,Okay so it is not a boutique hotel it is a Hilton so set your expectations accordingly. With that said the room was very nice and for the price you really can't beat it or the locations. We were in walking distance to the vibrant old town area and a short Uber ride to everything else we wanted to do. We didn't eat at the hotel but did visit the bar late night and the bar staff was excellent and made some very delicious cocktails. So if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a great location it would be hard to beat this option
5,Beyond customer service,"Is it possible that every staff person could go above and beyond...yes it is if you stay at this hotel.I love that as soon as I checked in, I received a text from the front staff asking if everything was ok in my room and if I needed anything.I love that when I asked for more towels they arrived within 10 minutes.I love that the General Managers of both restaurants made sure to accommodate my dietary restrictions by creating special meals for me.Here are a couple of things to take into consideration..1. The hotel does not have a typical gift shop. Instead there is a clothing shop.2. If you are attending a meeting and plan to share the guest room, the bathroom is small without much counter space. So only 1 person at a time can use it comfortably."
3,Barely Passable High Utilization Property,"Nothing negative to say here about the staff. Wonderful, helpful and a 10 out of 10 for the people. The property on the other hand barely merits a 5 out of 10. This is a high utilization, sterile hotel with some strange issues. I've stayed at a suite and in a regular room here. The suite was very strangely cluttered with useless furniture arranged in a bizarre way. The mattress and bed was so shaky that my wife had to sleep on the sofa because every time I moved the bed would shake. No stability and a poor quality mattress. Furniture seems poorly thought out and very worn. Space isn't utilized very well with massive needless gaps everywhere. There was almost no noise isolation from the noise from 6th street, so make sure you get a high floor or you will not be sleeping.The attached restaurant Cannon + Belle served barely passable food that was obviously pre-cooked and left a lot to be desired over 3 separate meals that I had there. So overall, if you have to stay here and it's convenient, it will be fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here. If you do stay here, be nice to the staff, they deserve it."
5,Excellent Service,I was able to check in early and when I did my room reeked of smoke. I advised Vera and she gave me 2 options to change rooms or they can re-service the room with a air machine. I chose the later. I went to lunch at the restaurant in the hotel and upon return the room was fresh and clean no more smoke smell. Vera checked in with me several times during my 5 day stay to ensure I was okay. Great job Vera!
5,Return Stay,"I always make sure to pick this hotel whenever I come to Austin for the convention I go to. Its location can't be beat, and it's always a comfortable stay. The people are incredibly friendly and I never have any complaints about how the hotel itself looks."
5,Don‚Äôt Judge a Book by its Cover!,"From the outside the Austin Hilton looks a bit dated. Don‚Äôt be fooled. The inside is completely remodeled (they‚Äôre working on the exterior now) and beautiful. The rooms are very nice, very clean and modern. You can control just about everything from the small device on your bed table. The hotel staff are terrific and friendly. It‚Äôs also within walking distance of everything in downtown."
5,Fabulous hotel!,"We stayed at the Hilton for the RTX convention. It was conveniently close to the convention center which was very nice. The room was amazing! The beds were wonderful - my daughter and I slept very well. The room was perfectly clean. One of my favorite features of the room was a control panel on the nightstand. You could control every light and the AC from the panel. It was perfect when I woke up a little warm and could turn down the AC without getting up. Check in was fast and easy. We had room service Saturday night. They were super busy but it still only took 40 minutes to get our food. It was wonderful. The concierge, Arianna, went out of her way to help Sunday morning with a small emergency. She was so nice! It was a perfect hotel stay and I will stay there again next year."
4,Great service and accomodation,"Was here for a conference and I enjoyed my stay. The staff are very friendly, my room was spacious, and the location is good. I would definitely recommend to others. Everything was smooth/flawless from check-in to check-out."
2,Not a good experience!,"The overall experience was poor and not typical of a Hilton. I was very disappointed by the lack of engagement from the team. When exciting the hotel, I was assured that I would be contacted by management after my departure and have yet to be contacted. The Customer Experience definitely does not seem like a priority."
5,Long Time Hilton Honors Member for a Reason,"The reason for brand loyalty is simple. You recieve a standard of service if staying at the Hilton in downtown New York or in Austin Texas. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and business friendly plus the location is perfect for attending downtown meetings. Cheers Hilton Team"
4,Decent View; One of the last Hiltons with a Functioning Exec Lounge,"I've stayed here a few times before, but this is the first time I've written a review. Extensive stay this time (5 nights) for a conference. I'm Hilton Diamond, so was upgraded to the Exec Floor (although all of the other people I knew at the conference were also upgraded, and they had no status, so it might have been related to the conference). Exec Lounge is great, and nice to see available (I'm so tired of booking Hiltons and finding that they've closed their exec lounge). Generous breakfast until 11am. Great coffee and soft drinks all day; reduced priced cocktails and snacks in the evening. With the minibar in the room to store sodas and fruit, the lounge was a real life saver for crazy conference hours. Rooms was decent sized and had views of Lady Bird Lake. Pool was nice and pool bar was open. Housekeeping was very responsive and helpful, as were bell staff. I had several items left for me at the front desk, and they were all found and given cheerfully (one even brought up to my room)."
5,Central location and great staff,Walking distance to almost all of the downtown area as well as being right beside the convention centre. Front end staff where outstanding at meeting all of our needs for my group and myself. Nice view of the city and surrounding area from my room.
5,great location great property,great location for the hotel...walking distance to most things....also Lime scooters are everywhere ...very friendly customer service...nice bar arwa...comfortable beds..I would recommend this place any time your in Austin
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the price-quality ratio of this hotel, and I think I paid too much for the type of room I had, rather than a Suite I consider it a normal room, but with an extremely expensive price. The staff is polite and kind, I had several problems with access and exit from the underground parking lot. As for the language on the 25th floor, it's nothing special and I do not think it's necessary to pay more for this, that of the Sheraton is much, much better."
5,Perfect!,The Hilton Austin is the perfect hotel. From the valet service to the perfect care of our room needs to the check out. Absolutely love this hotel. The on-site restaurants are fantastic as well. It t new to be a busy hotel due to the conference center next door but the service is very attentive.
5,Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Hilton Austin for a short family vacation. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. The waitstaff in the restaurant were warm, friendly, and helpful. The location is perfect - very close to 6th Street & many bar/restaurant options.We will be returning to the Hilton on our next trip to Austin."
4,Great rooms. Bad wifi.,"Beautiful & clean rooms. Staff is classy & attentive. The premium wifi was bad, only 18 mbps at max. There is a little too much price gouging. 4$ for a soda from the vending machine and 6$ from the bar."
5,True Southern Hospitality-Great Pet Friendly Hotel!!!,"We had a ball and Hilton‚Äôs collective team was outstanding!!! Especially appreciated was the welcome we received every time we came in by the bell Staff and Valet Attendants, as well as the Front Desk team. A smile, a bright greeting and an opened door goes a very long way! Being called by name....wonderful! Special call out to Garrett of the Bell staff. Every time he saw us and the pups he acknowledged us and asked if they were enjoying their stay as well! Simply Special! Kendall sent a follow up text to make sure we had a grand time.....this attention to detail is what makes this property fabulous! The next time we are in Austin...there is no need to think about where to stay! Hilton Austin takes the Voodoo Doughnut! Please keep it up!"
5,Excellent,Excellent comfort and friendliness!I stayed here for a week. Checked in within 5 minutes and in my room. Bell boy delivered and picked my bags within 10 minutes! Extremely good service! Pool was great! Location is easy to get to and lots of restaurants within walking distance plus the two in the hotel are very good. Room service is also fast and tasty. The only complaint and not really a complaint was that housekeeping didn‚Äôt leave me tea after the first night. I will definitely stay here again and would highly highly recommend it!
5,"Great property, highly recommend!","From check-in to check-out, everything was smooth and stress free. When in Austin, don‚Äôt hesitate to stay at the Hilton Austin. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and the rooms were clean and comfy!"
5,Brilliant Austin Downtown Hotel,"We had a great time, staying at this Hotel for a few nights. The rooms very very spacious and very clean. Reception Team were first class and offered us complimentary breakfast as we were their guest for the day - nice touch and wow the buffet breakfast was fantastic. At the breakfast we were helped by a lovely lady (originates from Hawaii). She was a credit to Hilton, made us feel very welcome and offered some great advice on what do and where to shop!!The Hotel is central and we were able to walk to the main attractions. Lots of places to eat locally as well. Best Hilton we have stayed at anywhere in the World - Well Done!"
5,Stayed at the Hilton in downtown Austin and loved it. Great location and very friendly staff!,"Our 2 nite stay was spectacular. Located in perfect location for downtown Austin. We rented bikes, walked to the bat attraction, found fabulous restaurants, and met lots of friendly people. The state capital is a must to see. Absolutely beautiful."
5,Five stars,"we had a wonderful time during our 1 week stay. The staff members are very nice and helpful. Our room is clean and beautiful. The location is perfect, 1 block from th 6th street. We really enjoyed stay here."
5,Great night's sleep,"The one thing I value in a hotel is the quietness of a room. This hotel was blissfully quiet. The HVAC had a setting to keep the fan on constantly but honestly it wasn't needed. Other than when the person in the next room came in for the night there wasn't a sound from the hall.I did online check in and took a corner room. Upon arrival I was informed that the room was not ready. I was moved to a room on the top floor, 26th, and given access to the executive lounge (on the 25th floor). The view was of downtown and Lady Bird Lake. It turns out that my room was directly above the lounge. Not a sound came from below. The room had plenty of space to spread out. They must have installed point of use water heaters because the shower and sink had almost instantaneous hot water. The pressure was great on the top floor. The HVAC had no problem cooling down the room counteracting the brutal Austin summer heat.The hotel is very large with a conference center. Parking is a little steep at $30 a day but that seems to be the same as other lots in the downtown area. The spots are quite narrow though.The location is great, just one block away from 6th Street. The Austin Convention Center is just across the street. It's also less than a 10 minute walk to Congress Ave. Bridge and about 15 to the Capitol. There are plenty of restaurant choices even if you don't want to deal with the 6th St craziness. However, there are two fine choices in the hotel itself.The complementary breakfast in the executive lounge was basic, oatmeal, eggs in a chaffing dish, fresh fruit, and other continental style breakfast fare. Snacks are available all day long (fruit, nuts, chex mix, soft drinks, coffee, tea, etc.) and there's a cash bar in the evening offering wine and beer.All said, great location, comfortable and quiet room, and helpful staff."
5,Great place to stay in downtown Austin,"I love this hotel. They have an excellent, friendly staff. The rooms are nice and so clean. There's a beautiful pool area. The location is great. It's right downtown, next door to the convention center and the rail line."
5,Excellent Stays at Hilton Austin during my official visit.,"The Hilton Austin is a great place to stay in downtown Austin, especially if your conference is at the convention center. The customer service is phenomenal. The hospitality staff were some of he best I‚Äôve ever had.Lisa & Brian in reception was very nice. I stayed their for 10 days and I had the best time. Decent size Starbucks on site, and live music on first floor bar (selective nights).Their pool is on the 8th floor and overlooks the Austin skyline. However, the pool is small compare to the guests on the pool. The Gym is also good. Parking is a bit steep at $32 a night.They have the electronic room key. If you want to party-party its walking distance to 6th street which is very loud and inebriated. The only thing bothered me is the lot of homeless people roam near by the 6th street and near by the hotel and may bother you with asking for dollars and help, which sometime become irritating."
5,Great choice in Austin,"Stayed in this property for 3 nights with my wife for a quick getaway. This is a great property located in downtown and walking distance to all the downtown attractions. Looking on the floor plan I noticed that some of the corner rooms are oversized so I requested one of those rooms which I believe ends in 19. It was great to have the extra space. The rooms are comfortable, the bedding is great. Ask to be facing the downtown and you get a great skyline view. We went to the pool area once and it was very nice. Plenty of loungers, a bar, nice pool, hot tub and great views. to get to the pool you have to pass through the spa. We did not use any services but it looked very inviting and they provided complimentary coffee, tea, fruits and water.The lobby is beautiful. During the day there is complimentary popcorn, water and once even frozen ices were available. The staff is very pleasant and I have to give them props for their customer service because my wife forgot her new bathing suit in the bathroom and only realized when we got back home in New York. I called the hotel and they connected me to security where a very nice and helpful gentleman said that the housekeeping did bring it down and upon verifying the room number, color and brand he said the hotel will ship it to me immediately and when I wanted to give him my contact details he already had them from my booking since they were expecting my call. I was very impressed with this level of customer service and the package was mailed using expedited shipment so we received a day later.The location is about 15-20 minutes from the airport so I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Austin."
5,Great Downtown Hotel,"The Hilton - downtown Austin was great. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Location was perfect for walking to 6th Street or even Rainey Street ( a long walk, but doable). Close to some great restaurants - and the onsite restaurants were good too. My room had a very modern feel to it - I suspect they remodeled/refreshed recently. And it was clean. I was on an upper floor - so no street noise. Overall, besides the busy lobby area, I found the hotel to be quiet. The Hilton App worked great for selecting my room and checking in. The digital key was hit and miss - but I was glad I had it when I left the room without my card key! The pool area was fun - and spacious compared to some other hotels I've stayed at. There are a lot of choices for lodging in the area, but this will be my pick for my next trip to Austin."
5,Amazing hotel,The Hilton hotel in Austin exceeded my expectations. First off it was the cheapest priced hotel in downtown Austin. Very great location to sixth street so I really liked the location for partying on sixth street. The staff was very friendly and was very helpful for the things I needed.
5,anniversary # 39,"We live in Austin but for my wife and my 39th anniversary we decided a night away from the dogs and kids might be in order. I just cashed in points and we had a decent king room reserved. When I checked in Jeremy at the front desk asked where I was from. Confessing I was a local and celebrating an anniversary Jeremy said ‚Äú let me see what I have that‚Äôs a little nicer‚Äù Ten minutes later we are unpacking our bags in a suite on the 21st floor with a great view of down town and the river. We did take a soak in the pool which is very nice though on a weekend was well populated with twenty five year olds.(some very good looking ones,though I only have eyes for my girl) I did have a great hand shaken Margarita at the poolside bar. We ate at the C&B restaurant in the hotel. I had an outstanding Bone in ribeye,my wife had perfectly prepared scallops. Very moderately priced for a nice hotel restaurant. Great friendly and attentive service from Jenni. The physical facility is nice as you would expect in a 4 Star hotel. But the staff is outstanding and made this stay a wonderful experience. We will be back and will recommend this Hilton to others."
4,Excellent service,Rooms a smidge small but service excellent. Pool deck has a great view but it also a tad small. I ordered off the menu for breakfast and loved the avocado toast. Taco restaurant is hit and miss on flavors but service was good.
5,Superb facility and superb staff,"I spent 15 days here for a convention in July. I recommend this hotel most highly.The hotel staff are not only competent, but they are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. For instance, one night I needed to print a document and could not get the computers in the lobby to work for me. A staff member named Kendall spent at least half an hour with me, and eventually figured out how to send my document to his hotel account so it could be printed. I don't know what he gets paid, but he should have been paid at the rate of a computer technology expert.Over the course of 15 days, I had many interactions with the front desk staff, and they were always helpful, often going above and beyond in their customer service.One drawback: Although the hotel provides mini refrigerators, They do not provide microwaves in the room. There is one microwave machine at the front desk, which the hotel staff will be happy to help you useThere is a Starbucks on the lobby level in the hotel, and the staff there was marvelous!I was amazed by the number of Hotel staff who greeted me by name."
5,Wonderful Experience,"Across the street from convention center. Wonderful heated pool. Clean, comfortable, quiet. Helpful, courteous staff. Lots of restaurants within easy walking distance: Rainey Street restaurants and 6th street bars, etc"
3,Just an ok stay,"Room was clean but furniture showing wear and tear. We were on the upper floor but we heard music at night which kept me up. Room service was disappointing. It took over 1 hour for bagel with cream cheese, muffins and cereal. Bagel was cold by the time it arrived. We didn't use the pool and jacuzzi because it was packed. Looked nice though. Location was convenient to 6th street with a lot of restaurants and bars near by."
5,Cool to match Austin,Top hotel great facilities great staff from reception to bar to concierge to spa and pool made my first trip to Austin a really enjoyable experience to start the day and return later each day -look forward to a return one day
5,Never fails to impress,"Here again this year for a conference (first time was last year). Great business hotel - central location. Has all that you would expect from this standard of hotel.Got room on Executive floor which gave access to lounge for breakfast, snacks and drinks, and a quiet place to work.Really like the check-in via the HH App - and the Digital Key which opens your door with your phone.Could not fault anything."
1,Daughter trip,Took my five daughters and stayer here five days. The service was horrible and they messed up our rooms on the first night. When I tried to fix it they were rude. I had asked for adjoining and never did get it. No one seemed to know what they were doing and everyone just said I am new so please bear with me? The whole front desk and spa must have gotten hired the night before we got there. I have been a Hilton member for over twenty years and this by far was one of my worst stays
1,Executive Floor hors d'oeuvres are HORRIBLE,"Just came back from the executive floor hors d'oeuvres...think tiny quiche filled with Campbell's Cream of Soup...the carrots actually had that grayish-white crust on them that you see in your own fridge two weeks after you forgot they were there. This is Austin? Texas? Tortilla chips out of a bag you could by at a CVS in New York...same for the pita chips. The cheese and bread were fine, no complaints there.Wine not the best.Worried about breakfast."
3,Good hotel,"Very large hotel very close to the convention center. I didn‚Äôt need to go there but it was literally across the street. Has 2 restaurants one (Austin taco project)open late; very good tacos.Near everything, good big hotel, only stayed one night so besides the restaurants didn‚Äôt try anything else. Had a large bar that was busy for a Monday night at 10.Going back in 2 weeks on business, hope it‚Äôs still good."
4,Great hotel but needs to redo carpet imN rooms,This hotel is in a great location. It just needs to have the carpet redone in the rooms. Very dirty and worn out. The staff was very friendly and rest of hotel was great. They except dogs and we thought that was great even though we didn‚Äôt have one with us.
5,Excellent hotel in downtown Austin,"A luxury hotel in downtown Austin, close to the famous 6th street.Good for business and leisure as well.Hotel has a very good restaurant (very expensive, though) and also a nice swimming pool and gym."
5,Our favorite Austin hotel,"The Hilton Austin is by far the best hotel in Austin. It's no wonder the hotel was named top hotel in Austin in 2017. The location is perfect walking distance to all the great restaurants, bars, and river activities. The hotel is always extremely clean, the rooms are all very new with great amenities, and the beds are very comfortable. The pool and fitness center on the 6th floor are much nicer than what you'd expect for a hotel pool and fitness center, as somebody who likes fitness I was very happy to have running trails nearby and a gym-style fitness center in the hotel.All that being said, the main reason the Hilton is such a great hotel is because of the staff. Every time I have stayed at the Hilton, the staff has always been extremely friendly and helpful. On my last visit, my wife and I were celebrating a special day and one of the hotel managers, Tiffany Nightengale, went out of her way to ensure that my wife and I had the best weekend we possibly could. From the time we arrived at the hotel to the time we left, the hotel staff went above and beyond our expectations for a hotel, it truly made our stay that much more enjoyable.If you want a clean hotel in the perfect location with great amenities and friendly staff, then the Hilton Austin is a must stay!"
3,"Perfect location, but disappointing accommodations.","We stayed at this Hilton during a weekend getaway in Austin two weeks ago. Unfortunately, it fell well below our expectations. I admit that the staff apologized and tried to fix the problems, but there were so many issues that I can't rate it favorably. The overarching issue was an overall lack of attention to detail.The hotel struggled with cleanliness in both the rooms and the common areas. We walked into our room and were greeted by a dirty hand towel on the floor next to the night stand. We checked our bed and uncovered stained pillowcases. We also found loose hair strands on our shower curtain, on the bathroom counter, and on the toilet. Loose hair is one of my biggest pet peeves. The night maid graciously gave us new pillows and removed the dirty towel.At around 9:30 the following morning, we left our room to head out for the day. We hopped onto the elevator and saw a filthy floor accented by a cigarette butt. Although it is not the hotel's fault that the cigarette butt was on the floor in the elevator, it is their fault for not cleaning it up until several hours later.This hotel has a lot of promise: it is in a great location for exploring the heart of the city, has great views, and is very well set up. One of the drawbacks is that in addition to the cleanliness issues, the room also felt a bit tired and dated compared to some of its nearby rivals. While the hotel cannot easily change its style or decor, by exercising due care, it can offer its guests the level of cleanliness warranted by the almost $200/night price tag."
4,Wedding Weekend,"My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Austin and have mixed reviews. The room was clean and well appointed. Amenities (shampoo, cream rinse, and body lotion) were nice. We were disappointed with the valet service, which had been described to us upon checkin as ""give us a call, give us 5 minutes, and you will have your car."" It was a busy weekend, but with that information, we did not expect it to take, on one occasion, 20 minutes to get our car. 7-10 minutes was a fair estimate of the other times we requested our car. Valet staff was polite and apologetic when they were delayed, but the privilege of valet parking came with a price and we did not feel we got our money's worth. I hope you are still reading, because upon checkout, we were asked about our stay, and when my husband mentioned they might want to work on their valet situation, they apologized and immediately removed the valet charges from our bill. The hotel personnel truly want customers to have a good experience."
5,Cannon and Belle simply amazing!,"My husband and I were in the city last weekend. After a day on the town we opted for dinner at the hotel. We were disappointed to find that Fin and Porter has closed but decided to give Cannon and Belle a try. WOW! Lucky us!! My husband and I are foodies to the core. This restaurant did not disappoint! Lyndsey our server dazzled us with her knowledge of the food and some great recommendations and incredible service. My husband had the mouthwateringly delicious ribeye steak over risotto with carrots. I had the shrimp and grits with fried spinach. The shrimp and grits were heavenly but the fried spinach sealed the deal. It was so different and delicious. Ashley, the Mgr, dropped by and we were able to rave about Lyndsey and the food. My husband always loves to speak to the chef when the meal exceeds expectations. Chef Yesica Arredondo was so gracious and it was great talking to her about beginnings and the experience she is trying to create for her customers. Just an amazing evening and we look forward to being back soon. Thank you everyone at Cannon and Belle for a memorable evening!"
5,Great choice in prime Austin location.,"This property is located right in the heart of Austin.Walking distance to the bars and restaurants and also the beautiful walking path on the river.A very attentive staff, second time here. First time they even had glasses to view the eclipse."
5,Great property for a staycation,Wife and I got away for a late night date and a stay at this great property. They were really accommodating and it's been a pleasurable experience every time we stay here. So much to do within walking distance and it's a superior property with great views.
5,Best Hotel!!,"My wife and I decided to spend the weekend in Austin, which we booked the Hilton Austin. From pre-checking until check out, our stay was amazing. The hotel was super clean and the reception area had refreshments and popsicles (for the summer heat). The hotel is in the heart of the city and walking distance of majority of the city‚Äôs attractions. Definitely would stay here again and would recommend to all."
4,Very Enjoyable,"This hotel is clean, bright and bustling with activity. Excellent restaurants, modern updated guest rooms and high quality meeting rooms made for a great stay. Very helpful staff, especially James who problem-solved our tech problems. Excellent location walkable to Congress and Sixth Street bars and restaurants."
2,Not a great area or view,Not a good location and area is run down. Lots of construction and noise. Hotel was clean but problems with keys that you use to use elevator. Pool doesn‚Äôt have waterfall like photos show. Staff was great and helpful. Cost to park is over 40 dollars and day. The sidewalks in are are in terrible condition fall hazard. Hotel is overpriced if I had to go back I would not stay downtown.
5,Darn near perfect,"I attended a board meeting over the weekend and found lots of positives. Rooms were up-to-date and clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Meeting rooms were quiet and temperatures were very comfortable. Breakfast, lunches and meeting snacks were all very good...lots of choices and tasty. My only complaint was the food at a board dinner held in one of the meeting rooms. The meat and fish were barely lukewarm and we sat for dinner when hotel staff advised us to sit. I'd definitely stay there next time I travel to Austin."
5,"The staff are wonderful, they made my trip!","Within two days of arriving I had come down with a flu. Fever, runny nose, aches and pains, the works. The cleaning staff took notice and left me extra Kleenex and towels. Guest services got wind of my flu and sent up hot tea with lemon and honey. They went out of their way to make me feel better. Southern hospitality at its warmest! I want to sincerely thank the staff for their kindness and consideration. The hotel is beautifully appointed. The restaurant is good and the rooms clean and comfortable. But the staff makes this hotel an 11 on 10"
5,Excellent stay,"The staff was very friendly. At one point, our keycards weren‚Äôt working and the staff made sure we could get into our room. The view from the room was very nice. Even with the mandatory fire drill that took place, we had a pleasant experience"
5,To the very last detail,"The place is in one word, exceptional. Although a ‚Äúchain‚Äù establishment, the friendly, personal-service-oriented and ever present staff make the place feel like a boutique hotel, family run. This hotel is immaculate with all those little touches like free flavored waters at every entrance site, and personal greeters stationed throughout the first several floors to help direct you and assist you with whatever you need. The young lady that checked us in couldn‚Äôt have been more polite and efficient. The lobby shop carries all the basics plus, and is run by an extremely polite and friendly man. The rooms are spacious, with beds that are very very cozy, and contain all the newest amenities like electronic keyboard controlled room lights/temperatures etc. ‚Äî-very clean to boot!!! The eighth floor holds the extensive exercise room, weight room, spa, and an outdoor pool and hot tub complete with outside bar along side. If all that weren‚Äôt enough, there apparently is a very large convention center, meeting section that we haven‚Äôt visited yet and, yes, a Starbucks just off the lobby.I may never leave"
4,Conference drive by,"Did not stay at this hotel this time but never disappoints.Downtown and near congress and 6th. Good and bad.Good if you want to enjoy the nightlife but the nightlife can keep you up.Parking is always an issue but you can find it.A great place for a conference, several floors and rooms to hold your conference, great a/v and wifi.If you are an exercise nut, you will love it. you have the river and park nearby to go run or bike.If here during bat season, go to the congress bridge and enjoy.A great place to stay."
5,Family Wedding in Austin,"Perfect location to do and see all the things possible in 4 days: LBJ Library [#1], Blanton Museum, U of TX and Longhorn Stadium, State Capitol, Bullock Museum, Bats under the Bridge, Driskell Hotel, Visitors' Center, St. Mary's Cathedral, O. Henry House, Susan Hannigan House, Coopers and Stubbs BBQ, and South Congress shopping. The bottled water on check-in and the hydrating station in the lobby were most welcome in the 90+ Austin heat."
3,Hilton Convention Center,"I stayed at the Hilton due to its reputation and because I‚Äôm a Hilton Honors member. However, during this stay they didn‚Äôt live up to my expectations.At check-in I was told my room was not ready and that I would receive a text when it was ready. Hours passed by with no text message. I checked three different times and on the third try the room was ready. I didn‚Äôt appreciate being told that I would receive a text and someone not following through with sending one.I was then assigned a room for a disabled person. Though I didn‚Äôt mind, I didn‚Äôt want to take a room that a true disabled person may have needed. I offered to give it up if someone needed it.Also, I was never acknowledged as a member and never offered the typical courtesies given to Hilton members.The room was clean, staff was professional and friendly. Amenities were available and housekeeping was willing to go beyond what was expected.Though there were those issues at the beginning, I would still stay at the Hilton Convention Center."
4,Location is perfect!,"Awesome hotel in the heart of downtown Austin. You can walk pretty much everywhere from here (6th street, Rainey St., the Capitol building, the lake, and more). The lobby was very nice and modern. The check in was fast and we were able to get in a room early. Room was pretty standard for Hilton, nothing special. The executive lounge is great and has good snacks in the afternoon! The pool area was small and looked really crowded, not any open seating and a party atmosphere. Gym was nice too ‚Äì overlooked the pool. Overall, a wonderful stay!"
4,Nothing all that wrong and a very friendly staff,"Got in at 10a and they had a room. It was clean. Everyone was nice. However, there wasn't anything sticky about the place, meaning, anything that would make me a loyal, repeat customer. Check out system on the TV didn't work either."
4,Great stay but room for improvement!,"I stayed for 3 nights with a conference at the hotel.Pros:Great view and locationLove the bed lights and room control center bedside!Great experience with Cannon + BellShower headComfy bedRecommendations:Improve conference banquet/food service, disorganized ; add milk alternative with coffee serviceIncrease Staffing in StarbucksCleaners in bathrooms on their phonesImprove service in Taco restaurantCalled for an iron that never came after 30 min had to go lookingConstruction all around hotelElevators are slow"
4,NISOD Conference stay,"Good hotel, great location, perfect front desk, great spa, pool very good with bar service, security excellent, room cleanliness below average, room amenities below standard for the price. Overall a good experience and would stay here again. They need to work with the housekeeping staff to improve service."
5,Perfect Stay,"The Hilton has clean rooms, super comfortable beds and good WiFi. It‚Äôs also conveniently located a short walk from many of Austin‚Äôs attractions. We especially appreciated the short walk to Ladybird Lake which is a great spot for a quick walk or water activities like SUP or kayaking. Also, be sure to stop by the front desk mid afternoon for great snacks."
4,Nice Amenities,"The breakfast spread was amazing. Not too many hotels have a steamroom and sauna to us for free. I will definitely stay there again in the future. The taco restaurant is a must try, if you like tacos."
2,Stay away!,"Over priced, questionable food. Awful neighborhood. Inadequate facilities for large groups. Worst convention I have ever attended. Do not bother complaining. They do not give a damn. I will never return."
5,Guest focus,"From the front desk to the management, the Hilton Austin puts a responsive focus on the guest experience. Comfortable beds, clean rooms, and all the expected amenities. Central downtown location within walking distance to many restaurants and attractions, so no need for the pricey parking for a vehicle if you're flying in. Hint: avoid the overpriced Starbucks, and the breakfast buffet in the in-house Cannon & Belle restaurant is worth trying at least once."
5,Excellent location and great place to stay!,"The hotel itself is very nice. Great lobby. Clean and spacious rooms. Loved that they had controls for the lights, thermostat right by the bed. High-tech and handy! Great service as well! Requested more towels and they were delivered very quickly, despite the fact the hotel was super full from a conference.Walking distance to great restaurants and bars! I would definitely stay at this property again!"
4,"Great location, nice staff, nice rooms, great meeting space. SLOW elevators","I was here for a conference, and everything was top notch as far as the conference. The room was organized well, acoustics were great, temperature was great (that's often a problem at big conferences). Breaks were done well, although they did run out of food at the first one. Subsequent breaks seemed better prepared. Traffic patterns were managed well around the conference rooms. Security was friendly and helpful.The rooms were nice - clean and functional bathrooms, comfortable beds, and good housekeeping service.The only complaint was that the lines for the elevators were horrible, and there just weren't enough elevators to accommodate multiple conferences at the same time.The location is really good - very convenient to 6th street, tons of food choices within walking distance."
4,Great location - need to provide water in rooms...,Hilton is within very easy walking distance to all of downtown. Rooms are nice and clean. Great boutique in lobby as well as full starbucks. Ate breakfast in restaurant which was delicious. Shocked that no waters are provided in rooms and no hotel shop or anything within a few blocks to quickly grab some. This should be remedied by hotel management. - especially for HH members.
5,Here for graduation weekend,"This was a great stay. Hotel was very nice and we booked a package that included breakfast and parking. Restaurant was great. Parking was convenient. They had feather beds and pillows and this exacerbated my son‚Äôs eczema and allergies. The front desk texted me in the morning to ask how my stay was and I told them about it via text and within minutes all of the bedding in our room was switched to synthetic bedding.I was also traveling with 3 other parties and we all booked separately. When I called the main Hilton line and asked if we could all be on the same floor the women said she couldn‚Äôt help bc we had booked through different websites (hotels.com, Expedia etc). I called the Hilton Austin and as soon as the front desk answered, they were able to help.These guys were super helpful. Great experience."
5,Nice hotel with a great location,"Perfect location with access to the convention center and entertainment district. Very clean, friendly staff, good value for your money. Restaurant is okay, but with many choices within an easy walk it was not a problem."
4,Coffee + Tacos,"Hilton Austin was the first big convention hotel built and the first few floors is hotel rooms and above it condos. It was a new concept at the time and many thought it was weird, and who would wants to live in a high rise condo? Years later more big hotels are present and lots of condo buildings.I have been in this hotel many times and the lobby/first floor is pretty big. You will find a nice bar, lounge seating and Cannon + Belle restaurant, and Starbucks. There is a very nice store that sell high quality apparel and a lot of it has an Austin flavor tourists need to check out. They added a new restaurant called the Austin Taco Project. Tacos is huge in Austin and always see this place busy. This hotel is not dated where they keep it fresh line places to remotely work and plugs for your devices.They setup a temporary stage during events. It is also located next to the Capital MetroRail station and steps away from 6th Street. This hotel had a pedestrian sky bridge connecting to the Austin Convention Center. The service concierge is always very friendly and helpful, and enjoying stopping by for coffee."
4,Comfortable stay,"I stayed here for a large conference last week. The rooms were clean and well kept. The location is wonderful, keeping us near to food & entertainment. For a hotel that can host several large conferences in its ballrooms, they do not seem to have the availability to host the number of guests that attend those events. Many of our attendees were sent to other hotels because there weren‚Äôt enough rooms. The parking garage is less that adequate as well, often being full and requiring guests to park valet for a higher fee. The lines for the elevators at the end of the conference each day were over an hour long. If you‚Äôre coming for a stay as a family or for business, this is a great hotel. If you‚Äôre thinking of planning a big event or attending a big event here, consider the issues I‚Äôve described."
4,Nice staff and good location,I chose the hotel for a conference because it was very close to the convention center. The staff were very nice and the room was very clean. I had a vertigo one day before I left and was very worried about the fight the next day. The manager immediately came to my room after I called and arranged the 911 service and kept talking to me so that I felt comfortable after the MTs left. I really appreciated it. The only thing I don't like is the lunch/dinner service. There were not a lot options for different kinds of food.
5,Could not have been better!,"We stayed at this hotel for a conference that we were hosting and everything was absolutely perfect. From the Event Manager to the housekeeping staff, they were all just so kind and helpful. The rooms were very clean and updated and had everything I needed. I will definitely stay here again."
1,"Awful! Hilton, shame on you!","I am here now at a convention much waited for for 6 nights.I arrived 2 days ago after a long flight and had to change my room 3 times (!) before settling in due to constant noise in the rooms I was offered. Finally the receptionist accompanied me, and recognized that the loud buzzing noise came from the fridge, which he then unplugged and I was finally fine.I then went to fetch the packages I sent to the hotel. Pre ordering those packages I contacted the hotel asking if I can send the packages to them. The answer was: yes! Sure you can! So I happily did.But when I came to pick them up I was told there‚Äôs a stunning fee of $7-$15 for each package!! I showed them the email I received regarding, and they still argued saying: ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt tell you there is a fee, but they didn‚Äôt tell you there isn‚Äôt‚Äù.What??I had to argue and explain that if there is a fee - it is ALWAYS stated (this was the reason I‚Äôd sent the question to begin with). Eventually they unwillingly said they‚Äôll cover it or some of it.I hate needing to fight for what‚Äôs right, and I was so surprised that this is the treatment I get from Hilton. It felt salty but I moved on.Then, yesterday night, I was taking my shower, and when I pulled out the towel after I was done and opened it, the room was filled with white sprinkles of something. I shook it again and again to try to make it go away, trying not to breathe it in, but it was packed. I didn‚Äôt know if it was dust or fabric residues, but when I put it on me the smell was unmistakeable - this towel was never washed! I tried the other one - but same thing. I washed myself again, and tried to get dry with the tiny hand towel.In the morning I called house keeping, to ask for new towels, but maybe because it was very early the call was answered by a really nice receptionist. I told him what happened, and asked if they could send new ones. He said sure, and he offered me compensation (which I didn‚Äôt even expect): free breakfast until the end of my stay.I was SO happy with this service, and was very grateful.Since my 6 night stay is divided to 4 different reservations, I wasn‚Äôt sure he meant to the end of the current reservation, or to the end of my stay as he said, so on my way to BF, I stopped by reception, and asked the co receptionist what he meant. She checked and said it‚Äôd be until Monday - the last day of my stay, and that I‚Äôll just need to tell the restaurant I‚Äôm ‚Äòon the list‚Äô.Happy and excited I went on with my day, but in the afternoon I received 2 vouchers for BF under my door, instead of 4. So again I needed to go to reception and ask for the right vouchers.They said they see nothing on the system, and that their manager will contact me regarding. He didn‚Äôt.At night I went there, AGAIN, and again spoke to another receptionist who said he‚Äôll consult his manager if I could wait for a bit. After about 5 minutes he came back saying there‚Äôs nothing on their systems so I don‚Äôt get any BF.I thought - this is too much! Why do I have to keep spending time at reception instead of just having a good time?? This is unreasonable, do I really need to ask everything that they tell me to be in writing??Seeing my dissatisfaction, he went again and came back saying that they don‚Äôt know what happened (so I begged him again - talk to the 2 receptionist that were there at 6:30 am), but ok, they‚Äôll give me the BF.OK? No, because now comes the worst part:As he was writing the vouchers, the manager came, and stood close. Suddenly he got involved in the conversation, came closer and said:‚ÄúWe switched you rooms 3 times, we agreed to cover your packages storage fees, you asked for a room discount (???*), now you ask for breakfast - this is the last thing you can use the ‚Äúlet us make it right‚Äù with us.WHAT?????????????He was so offensively suggesting that I was trying to use them??????? How dare he? ? ?I was so insulted! I was holding back my tears. Not only that I needed to spend my time fighting to get what I was promised (by the email re the packages, and by the 2 morning receptionists) - which should NEVER had happened to begin with, but to accuse me of trying to ‚Äúmilk‚Äù their good intentions?!?Never ever in my life had I had such a disrespectful rude treatment, and I‚Äôve been to many many hotels.*He mentioned I asked for a room discount - I was calling to adjust the rate to the convention rate because of a problem *Hilton‚Äôs* system had while we were booking. It was instructed by the organizers and approved by Hilton that we‚Äôll do so.RUDE! OFFENSIVE! BAD.I am angry and hurt. Hurt. From a hotel front office manager! Never known it was an option - I thought they should make people happy.Stephen - I tell you this from the bottom of my heart - shame on you!And Hilton - you just made it WRONG.I guess that customer service at the Hilton is not what it used to be, and I highly suggest you will NOT stay here. Ever."
5,Excellent personal service!,"Beautiful facility, comfortable room with a great view. But the best was when Chris Simmons from Security came to my room with a replacement macbook air cable for the one I had lost while traveling. Above and beyond!"
5,Great choice in Austin!,"Great place to stay in Austin for convenience, as well as nice rooms with very comfortable beds! We loved our view of the city from 19th floor! Also - the spa, fitness and pool area was a highlight of our stay. Even though the hotel was very crowded at the time, the pool and spa area was never very crowded. Always clean and peaceful....and enjoyed a wonderful massage. We could easily walk to so many places from this hotel....and we also found Uber to be extremely quick and reliable, to and from the hotel. Staff and front desk were always friendly and helpful. I will mention, this hotel is huge and caters to convention attendees (with convention center across street), which means many, many people, and extremely long lines at Starbucks every morning. BUT I still enjoyed the location and amenities enough to warrant 5 stars, and I would consider returning again!!!"
5,more sales!,"everything good, except my reservation is king size bed, but two doubles, its ok, not a big deal. we chose Hilton Austin is because there was online sale in March, wish have more sales in future, then definitely would stay with Hilton at the first choice."
5,Nice hotel. Great location.,"This is a very nice hotel. Staff was helpful. Rooms were well appointed and quiet. The location was great. I walked all over downtown, to the Warehouse District and could uberto points beyond.The hotel is right next to the convention center and within easy walking distance to lots of really good restaurants."
5,Austin City Limits,"Excellent hotel in all respects. The Executive Lounge is fairly ‚ÄúSpartan‚Äù as were the PM hors d‚Äôoeuvres and the weekend breakfasts but while adequate, improvement and upgrading should be a priority. Other than this one suggestion all else was top-notch."
5,Great location and perfect hotel for Austin visit,"My husband and I stayed here while visiting our son for Thanksgiving. It was a very comfortable hotel in a great location. The staff were friendly and it was just perfect for our visit. Easy to walk to the best parts of town. We used the gym which was totally adequate for a quick workout and the price was very reasonable. If we were coming to Austin for the first time or we had not been planning to spend most of our time at our sons apartment we probably would have chosen a more boutique type hotel but this is really a good choice for people who want a good location, good price, and a nice clean room."
5,"Great downtown location, friendly service","I stayed here while attending a convention. The location across from Convention Center was fantastic & convenient. The staff were friendly & helpful. The room is your basic hotel room, plenty of space, with king bed & chair/footstool & desk. The bed was very comfortable & extra pillows brought promptly on request. The fitness room was well used in the mornings but it was great to have access to cardio machines & weights. I didn't use pool or Jacuzzi but they looked inviting on roof of 8th level. Coffee, tea & fruit were available in fitness center which was a nice touch. There were large containers of ice cold fruit infused water at gym & at registration desk. There is a Starbucks in lobby of hotel but I didn't eat there. Downtown area has an abundance of eateries to suit every budget & taste. Overall I highly recommend the Hilton for the location & friendly staff"
5,Birthday weekend!,Excellant hotel. Staff is very accommodating! Location is terrific. No car needed. Kinda pricey but that could be just this weekend. Austin is a great place to visit for music food walking & climate. So many great restaurants everywhere. Very young town too!
5,"Nice place, but high prices during conference time","The hotel itself is very nice with a fair amount of parking underground. I had picked out a room that I thought would have a decent view, but unfortunately it wasn't going to be ready by check-in. The front desk assistant let me know that they had the same room but 2 floors higher which was perfect. The view was incredible (pointed west towards the owl building). The location is also pretty amazing, although you do have to be careful about the homeless shelter that's just north of there. Other than that, just watch out for conferences. They really jack up hotel prices for those."
5,Wonderful Hotel in Downtown Austin with excellent staff!,"This is without doubt, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at - and I stay in a lot of hotels!The staff in the reception area and the greeting we always received as we came and went from the hotel during our stay, really made so much difference - they actually made us feel welcome at the hotel - wow - how nice is that!Thank goodness for great service and well trained staff! Congratulations!The room was quiet, large, very clean and well maintained. Blackout curtains are also a plus.The Executive Lounge is also very nice and relaxing and there was a great selection of food @breakfast. There is an outdoor pool and hot tub but we didn't have time to use that facility.Highly recommended if you are in Downtown Austin!"
5,Easy access to conference center,"Stayed here for a corporate conference. We are a large company and they managed our arrival, company dinners, crowd at elevators and our departure seamlessly!Every employee at every level was pleasant, accommodating and professional. Conference center is right across the street and you are within walking distance to restaurants and bars. Also close to the airport which is also very convenient!"
4,"Wonderful hotel, parking is an issue","The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. Check in was a breeze. The room was clean and had a great view. I love the mobile aspect and digital key.My only note was the parking situation. I sat in a long line only to be told if I wanted to self park, it was on the back of the building. As others have mentioned, the garage is tight. Very tight. And there was no assistance to help me get bags out of my car before or after I parked in the garage. At the price point of this hotel, that was the one aspect that I feel fell short.Otherwise, I had a wonderful experience and would definitely come back here again."
5,Perfect location. Really nice overall.,"No real complaints. We had a room on the 25th floor with executive lounge access which saved us money on snacks, water, and breakfast. The restaurant downstairs was good with my favorite dish being ""The American"" BBQ sandwich. Turn down service at night and the front desk was always willing and able to assist with questions. Hotel walking distance to 2nd street shopping and 6th street partying."
3,Conference center hotel,Close to the conference center if that‚Äôs important. Within walking distance of downtown. Our room was large but minimal nothing elaborate. Bed and pillows were fine but not fabulous. Front desk was super friendly and helpful!!
5,Outstanding Service!,"Stayed in this property for five days to attend a conference. Everything was wonderful, but the staff service throughout the conference was the best I've ever experienced. Truly noteworthy and exceptional!"
5,Great visit with my close girlfriends!,My room was great!! I want to recognize Ariana for really helping customize and personalize my stay. She helped me pick a nice room with a view and was there to help answer all of my questions during my stay!! Thank you and great property! The location is perfect!!
4,Good hotel with great location,"This hotel is in a great location. As a diamond member though, I seldom get an upgrade. Also, their executive lounge is one of the most skimpiest I've ever seen. For breakfast, all they have is plain eggs with some fruit and not even yogurt to go with it. Their expresso machine was out last time I was there. They can do some work on that lounge for sure. Their rooms are average for the Hilton brand."
4,Gave Hilton a try after a 20 year hiatus and it didn't disappoint,"I was very skeptical when booking a stay at Hilton Austin mostly because I've not stayed at a Hilton since the 90s but gave it a shot since this particular location was golden! It was at the center of downtown within easy distance to bars, restaurants, cafes. As expected, Hiltons are a little dated in decor but what they didn't have in contemporary decor, they made up in service, ease of access, cleanliness, and convenience for the business traveler.The room was dark, even with all the lights on. Shower fixtures were updated. Halls were clean and room service trays were removed quickly -- something I always check for.Not bad at all! I'd actually stay again!"
5,Nice stay,"We were very pleased with the room and the service. The location was easy to find from the airport. Sixth Street, where everything is happening in Austin, was only a couple of blocks away. We found all of the people working there to be courteous and helpful!"
5,Fantastic Experience,"From the moment that we checked in we had a wonderful and welcoming experience. The staff was on point, the hotel was incredibly clean, we would certainly come and stay again! Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our stay a great one!"
4,Great place with a horrible Taco restaurant attached.,"If you don't go to the Taco Project restaurant that is located inside of this Hilton location, then you'll enjoy every bit of your stay. It is one of the nicer Hiltons in the country. There was a yappy dog staying next door and the only reason I knew it was barking was because I faintly heard it while the room was completely silent. It was so faint that I had to place my ear up to the wall to make sure I was even hearing it correctly. The location is great, the stay was great."
5,An Austin Staple,"Quality facility located in the heart of the city. Walking distance from nightlife and good restaurants, quick ride to UT Austin campus. Service is always top-notch, and the hotel bar makes a quality cocktail as well!"
4,"Great location, great room","I was in business in Austin but stayed 30 min form downtown, but since I had next day late flight we decided to stay in Hilton downtown. The hotel location is prime. Close to the action of 6th street and very close to the convention center. The room was great. The executive lounge was very good and had good breakfast. The only minor issue I had is I could not connect to WiFi in my room and had to use my Verizon air card.Other than that, this hotel is very great and will be back here for sure."
3,Nice hotel but with issues.,"This is a nice hotel and close to 6th street, but it has some issues. Our confirmation for the executive floors upgrade wasn‚Äôt honored. The pillows are flat, and impossible to get comfortable on. There‚Äôs a lot of outside ambient noise if you‚Äôre on the highway side. And the restaurant, while very good, is way overpriced."
4,Too much for too little.,For $413.00/noc I expected spectacular especially as a diamond hhonors member. Except for the city view the room was very plane Jane. The room was clean and modern but the value was awful. I checked out after just one night and spent the next 3 nights in the Doubletree Arberatum which was a wonderful experience and an awesome value especially after upgrading me into a suite and full breakfast comped each morning. I used Lyft for transportation and they were great.
5,Great Hotel,Very impressed with the Hilton Austin from check in to check out. Rooms were clean and spacious. All the staff were very friendly. Only drawback was that dogs are allowed. I would recommend this hotel.
3,Proximate to Convention Centre,This is a solid Hilton hotel about average for Hilton's. All the comforts that you can expect from a Hilton. The plus is it is across the street from the Convention Center. There is a sky bridge connecting the two but it was under repair. Geek out: They have the electronic room key via their phone app. That was just a cool geek factor and it worked every time.
4,Great location,"Great location, right next door to the convention center. Hotel staff is fantastic, and the rooms are spacious, clean, and quiet. Very conveniently located within walking distance of 6th Street entertainment district."
5,Great hotel!!,Staff was very friendly and the facilities were first rate. Excellent location downtown. Close to everything. The restaurants were very good and the view as incredible. Easy walking distance to lots of attractions. Will definitely be back!!
5,Awesome Hotel,Awesome Hotel right next to 6th St and Rainey St. The staff was awesome. Vera at the front desk treated us like we were Rock Stars. Would definitely stay again. The pool and the gym are cool. Upgrade to get the snacks/breakfast/alcohol on 25th floor.
5,One of my FAV properties!,"Clean, friendly staff, helpful and treated me special even though there were thousands of people in and out of the hotel for SXSW. Check-in was easy, the room service was outstanding. I wish there had been a fridge and microwave in my room but otherwise, great stay."
5,Even a Lobby Guest gets the Royal Treatment,"I've stayed here for a conference in the past. This year, they were all booked for the same conference so I stayed elsewhere. However, I still came back here to have a meeting in the great lounges of the lobby. Several great seating arrangements to choose from, with, drinks and dining to match. I enjoyed my meeting but left my prescription sunglasses on a coffee table!!!! Oh No!!! I came back 15 mins later and they were gone!!! OH NO!!!I really need these glasses and I love them, so I went to the front desk and not one but two nice folks at the desk tried to help me. They tried to figure out who on staff was tending to that area's care, they took my number, a detailed description of the item, and even left the desk to check with lost and found. I eventually had to leave for another meeting.Three hours later, I got a call. The security guard called me. He requested a detailed description from me of the color and brand of the glasses, then confirmed he had them. That was Chris Simmons, super professional guy who wasn't gonna give those glasses to just anyone.The didn't give up and I thought that they would because I wasn't a room guest, but they didn't. They showed me the same level of service that they would've shown any guest and I really appreciated it. Next year, I'm booking early to stay here again for my conference."
5,"Beautiful hotel, felt like a luxury stay","The hotel is well located downtown, close to the Capitol and all the bars on 6th street. The rooms are as beautiful as you would expect, with plenty of in-room comforts. I'm loving that hotels are now getting on the USB port bandwagon and had plenty of these available to charge all your gadgets.It's worth joining Hilton Honors to get free wifi access and a key on your phone as well (although I kept forgetting to activate mine!)The biggest bonus of the Hilton Austin is the gym. It has the best hotel gym of any hotel I've been in (sorry Hilton Miami!). A full range of dumbbells, machines and cables are available, along with plates (but a Smith Machine not a rack) and a whole range of attachments. Was definitely the most well equipped.The pool and hot tub are outside but even when the weather was overcast it was great to go and sit and soak.If you're wanting a little luxury in your Austin stay, the Hilton is a great option, would stay here again!"
3,Could be Better,"Average hotel with your basic room. Bathroom was a little on the small side and towels are not very soft.Service is ok, not great. This said, concierge staff are excellent.Noisy hotel.Next time I would stay at the Marriott across from the conference centre, looked better."
2,"Friendly at first, very unhelpful afterwards","Nice welcome and smiles all around when I arrived; they provided good directions, guidance for dinner etc. The hotel is ok; there are others just as good. When I called after my stay to get a copy of my bill, I had to call three times (and I still don't have it). Lots of excuses, ""we'll have it emailed to you in 5 minutes"" etc. They can do better."
5,Staff was EXCELLENT all around hotel,I really enjoyed my time at this hotel. It was the first time bringing my parents and boyfriend to the city and it was a GREAT location to everything we wanted to see and do. We stayed on the executive level and it was well worth it! We were able to get snacks and drinks all day long before heading out. The breakfast was great. I would definitely recommend this to all my family and friends.
1,SO NOISY!,"There are too many things that aren‚Äôt good about this hotel, but #1 is the noise. I changed rooms but it made no difference. Very loud people, yelling in hallways till 2:30 am. This hotel attracts a really rowdy, loud crowd...so if you want ANY sleep (I got none), stay somewhere else. And the rooms are nothing special at all, so spend your money at another hotel."
5,Meeting venue,"Central location. Clean room, great service. Excellent meeting facility. Lobby restaurant convenient but so much great food in Austin wouldn‚Äôt make the restaurant a first choice. Hilton Honors gives you extra perks of free WiFi which is great."
5,"A Very Enjoyable Stay - Excellent Service, Updated Room, Great Executive Lounge and Convenient Access - 10/10!","I just completed my first trip to Austin, and was very impressed with the Hilton Austin. Bryana Slusher and her Staff provided outstanding (prompt, courteous, flexible) Diamond Level service for me throughout my stay. My room on the 25th Floor was clean, updated and had a terrific downtown view. The Executive Lounge on the 25th Floor was a great place to work, with a lot of outlets at clean and spacious desktop and countertop workspaces, timely arrangement and broad assortment of snacks, coffee, and drinks, all with courteous service. The hotel's location (about a $25-$35 Uber ride from the airport) is close and convenient to UT Austin, the Texas State Capitol, and the lively and fun activity on 6th Avenue (just a block away). I also enjoyed the Austin Taco Project, a restaurant located on site. In addition, the six elevators were fast and available frequently (always a good thing for people with tight meeting schedules). Finally, the UPS store on site was reasonably priced (not with the 400% FedEx store mark-up at other Hilton properties (eg, Hilton Anatole in Dallas - ridiculous) and quite helpful when I needed to print and bind presentation books. If I ever return to Austin for business or pleasure, I will stay at this property - as a Diamond Member - I give it a 10/10!"
5,Trip to present at conference,Excellent accommodations. The staff were very friendly. Room was fabulous. Love the executive floor and lounge. I appreciate the new text feature. It was an added level of service and was very convenient/ easy to use.
5,Perfect location for conference AND weekend Getaway!,"Great staff.....I have stayed in many Hilton properties as a Diamond For Life Member, The Austin Hilton on 4th street is one of my favorites.....why?#1-STAFF, #2- Location, #3 Accommodations.A special shout out to Kendal at the front desk & Ms. Pamela guest services manager. These two are professional, courteous, and strive to always make our stay a 10! Thank you Kendal and Pamela for another outstanding stay. Also, the location is great and walking distance to some of the best Austin Restaurants (Eddie V's, Truluck) and the best Austin jazz venue (The Elephant Room). For our next weekend getaway from San Antonio, we will most definitely go back and stay at The Austin Hilton.Thanks again Kendal, Pamela, and the entire staff for a great stay.PS: Valet staff and Bellmen were also a 10!"
5,One night at the Hilton Austin - diamond perspective,"This review is from the perspective of a Hilton  Diamond member. We stayed for 1 night in February the day of the marathon.  We booked our room using points, and interestingly the points went down 3 days prior to our arrival so we managed to get a points adjustment.  It's always a good idea to check.The hotel itself is beautiful, and as a convention hotel, very large with a very spacious lobby.  Our room was amazing, we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom King suite on the executive floor.  My only regret is we were only there for the one night - but this room was more like an apartment and we loved it.   The executive lounge was really nice, with many vegetarian options.  For breakfast, we had the buffet in the lobby restaurant which was very good.  Again, many vegetarian options.    The hotel is very centrally located and in easy walking distance to many attractions.  For other locations, we used Uber - no need for a car rental in Austin - but on our way to San Antonio, there are rental agencies downtown, no need to go back out to the airport.  All in all we had a wonderful stay and appreciated the diamond benefits."
3,A Very Nice Downtown Hotel But...,"My wife and I spent 5 nights recently at the Hilton Austin while attending a large meeting. The hotel was large and nicely appointed. Our room was very comfortable but had a few interesting problems, all in the bathroom. First, let me say that we were staying in a mobility accessible room, so there was a roll-in shower in the bathroom. These aren't my favorite as water usually flows into the main part of the bathroom, but I'm used to that. The strange thing is that it took over three and a half minutes to get luke warm water in the shower, even though water in the sink was hot almost instantly. I'd estimate it took over six minutes to get water flowing in the shower that was comfortably warm. Second, the drain stopper in the bathroom sink wouldn't stay closed. Usually that's a simple problem to fix but in this hotel the area under the sink is completely closed off. I requested that the stopper be fixed but that never happened. Third, the stop on the hot water faucet was broken so that the valve just turned and turned. We had to be careful to make sure it was in the proper position to be turned off to avoid wasting water. Other than those oddities, we really enjoyed the room. It was large enough for us to park an electric scooter in it without it being in the way.We stayed on the 20th floor in room 2017, which had a splendid view of the roof of the convention center. The even numbered rooms had a much better view of town, so if you have a choice, choose even.One last thing.....this hotel has a 13th floor!"
5,Outstanding stay in downtown Austin,"I was attending a conference at the Austin Convention Center and chose to stay here. From the moment I stepped in the door to the final goodbye, I felt at home. Everyone on the staff was awesome. They were welcoming, courteous, helpful and friendly. The room was spacious with a great view of downtown. The bed was comfortable and the room was extraordinarily clean. Next time I have an opportunity to visit Austin, I plan on staying here."
5,Well kept and accomodating staff,"Stayed Feb. 25-27 on points as a Honors Diamond member. We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom King suite which was very spacious and had a separate living and dining area with a wet bar. Bedroom was very large and had more than enough room for a pack and play for our 2 year old son travelling with us. The Austin Taco Project restaurant in the lobby area served up some great tacos at reasonable prices. The executive lounge on the 25th floor had a good breakfast selection every morning and was staffed by amazing Jennifer! She made us feel very welcome and went out of her way to ensure we had everything we needed. She even gave our son some coloring books each day. On the last day (today) he was so thrilled and it made his day. Thank you Jennifer!! Amazing service indeed, you deserve all the kudo's possible..Would definitely stay here again if coming back to Austin."
5,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Vibe","First of all, I love Hiltons! The Hilton in downtown Austin is really beautiful. As soon as you walk in you feel the energy of the hotel. The lobby is open with lots of action. The elevators and the hotel is general is extremely well kept.This hotel is also really well placed within the city of Austin. You‚Äôre just a block from numerous restaurants and shopping is close by as well. The area around the hotel is safe and walking around the city also has a good safe and pleasant feel. Austin generally feels safe and friendly.When you arrive at your room you‚Äôll find ‚ÄúHilton!‚Äù Great beds, pillows and bedding; beautiful bathrooms with all the amenities; quiet rooms from which you hear nothing from the halls or the rooms around you; coffee makers with all the necessary condiments; nice TV with on-demand movies; etc. It is what almost every Hilton is - quiet, comfortable, clean, beautiful. Hilton members have a really nice club on floor 25 with receptions every night and breakfast every morning. If you‚Äôre going to Austin for fun I highly recommend the downtown Hilton Hotel!"
5,"No complaints, great stay","I spent three nights and everything was great. The room is large, clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is great and within walking (or short car ride) to nearly everything. Easy walk from 6th St after an evening of fun."
5,the security officer nisha really helped me out made it easy to get into and use my safe she has a really good personali,everything was clean perfect view of downtownbeautuful hotelgym and spa is great 24 gym is very convienentspa prices are resonablemy favorite is the poolpool deck has a real nice hot tubmy stay was wonderful
5,Since I finished my secondary school,"Dear TripAdvisor Reader,At first I just say that I have had a coincidence to write on Trip Advisor webpage. In reality I had been here, Austin, since I was in secondary school with my family Dad for visit and getting familiar with this beautiful and fantastic city, my brother who had to study Engineer in Los Angeles. About me I was too young but this city impressed me too much until I had been dreamt and much preferred to continue my high school here. I love here so much (So in love...so much in love..) and I am definitely still love this hotel too ( please see my review of Millennuim Hilton nearby Chaopraya River @Bangkok for having Chinese Dim Sum @YUAN restaurant)The hotel @Austin was gorgeous and first Class five star services to clients, everything's all perfection...this was the first impression including whole memory for my writing here."
4,"Great location, nice hotel","Friendly staff, walk to everything downtown. Some rooms exposure to loud exterior noise due to active downtown nightlife! Workout center is small but well equipped. Complimentary coffee at workout center (very good!) and whole fruit made it unnecessary to stand on LONG Starbucks line in lobby, once I bought some yogurt and granola bars for the room!"
3,Don't be put off by the convention crowd chaos,"There was a 4000 person convention going on next door, so we thought we had really goofed by thinking this was a good place to stay to enjoy downtown Austin for a few days. After the initial problems with unloading the car at a busy hotel, everything settled down & we enjoyed the location. Most of our problems were on the morning of check out when every liquid in the refrigerator was frozen & the bathroom lights all went out for no reason in the middle of a shower. Staff was friendly & hotel made adequate compensation for these inconveniences. We were quite satisfied with the stay, byt be sure to check your bill before authorizing payment. We had booked a Stay & Park rate, but were charged for parking the first day. This too was smoothly corrected to our satisfaction."
5,"Comfortable, friendly and convenient!","I had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton in downtown Austin for a convention I was attending, and I would I highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are very much like what you would expect from a typical Hilton-clean, comfortable and stocked with morning beverage necessities. The beds/pillows were very cozy and I slept well-which is typically rare when I travel. What I really enjoyed about this hotel was the friendly staff, actual Starbucks and two really good restaurants located conveniently onsite. It‚Äôs also located directly across the street from the convention center and a few blocks from great restaurants in every direction.I would definitely stay here again."
4,Great Staff & Lobby,"We had a good experience at the Hilton Austin, relishing the location and the incredibly friendly, accommodating staff. The lobby is large and comfortable, with a couple restaurants and multiple sitting areas. Only dropping a star because 1) the room was a typical hotel room without anything great going for it, and 2) we were on the top floor and could hear the music from 6th Street until the bars closed at 2am. The first night we actually called the desk because we thought someone was having a party in the hotel, it was so loud. But, some earplugs could do the trick (didn't use them because we had our toddler with us). Overall, though, very positive stay."
5,"Nice, modern hotel","The Hilton in Austin is centrally located, just a couple of blocks away from the 6th street. Rooms on the higher floors offer great views of the city. Our rooms were very spacious although the bathrooms could be a little bigger. The hotel is very sleek and modern."
5,Huge Hotel!,"First off, the staff was very friendly and hotel smelled great upon entering. Was quickly checked in and was even asked if I wanted a ‚Äòhigh floor‚Äô or a ‚Äòlow floor‚Äô, ‚Äònear or away from the elevators‚Äô. I was shocked! Love that they do this! The room is a good size with lots of extra space for luggage. Room was very clean and air worked well. I love the remote control/key pad for the lights near the bed( it dims in the dark but stays lightly lit for access). Would stay here again for sure! Oh, parking is a little steep, so we parked in lot across the street. Valet is $41 and self parking is around $31."
5,In the heart of downtown Austin,"My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Austin while in Austin last week.. We enjoyed the restaurants in the hotel and having a Starbucks on site was a great convenience. The complimentary hot coco was a wonderful surprise. The rooms were clean and roomy. The location can't be beat, if you are in Austin for a conference."
4,"Ideal location, very accommodating personnel, nice rooms",This was a great place to stay if you want to be in the middle of Austin. I was attending a conference in Austin at the convention center and the location was perfect for me to get to meetings during the day. On the negative side - the sky bridge that I thought would be in place this Feb. has not been completed yet - rooms are OK - middle of the road but clean and average size.Parking is available on premise.
5,Weekend in Austin,"Booked through the airline with their vacation site. The hotel was beautiful, everything you needed right there. Location great walking distance to all the great restaurants and bars. Complimentary ride to the airport which was really awesome!"
3,This Hilton needs to step up their game,"There is nothing wrong with this Hilton and if it were 20 years ago, it would be fantastic. Unfortunately for this hotel there is stiff competition with a brand new Fairmont opening a block away. The service here is good. The executive lounge is good. The rooms are average. Nothing sets this hotel apart from some very nice hotels in Austin. If I didn't need to stay here - I wouldn't."
4,Nice Hotel,I stayed for two days. The room was nice and no loud noises! The on-site meeting rooms were very convenient for the conference I attended! I did eat in the hotel restaurant one night and the food was great!
3,NICE PROPERTY BUT AMENITIES MISSING,"This is our second stay at this hotel and it‚Äôs a real mixed bag. Front Desk staff are great, room okay but staff in Executive Lounge were either clueless or passive aggressive. ‚ÄúWhat is that sauce for?‚Äù met with a cold stare and a curt ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù as she walked away. This kind of interchange occurred several times. Rooms attempt to be high tech but the sophisticated switch system left us baffled. Two workers came up but didn‚Äôt know any more than we did. Not unpleasant but a very inconsistent experience."
5,Really nice!,Only 7 miles from the airport and conveniently located downtown. Very nice reception and concierge people..they are genuine and not snooty :) large comfortable modern room and pet friendly! Would stay here again.
5,Excellent Hotel Downtown Austin,"I was here with my wife for a conference at this hotel. Great location for walking downtown to restaurants and 6th street bars. Bus stop and Metro Rail stop just outside the hotel. I was impressed with the staff here, they were very attentive and available. Everything was very clean and up to date. I did visit the spa which had a heated outdoor pool, weight room and treadmill room. A massage there was a real treat."
5,Conference stay,"We had a king room on the executive floor (25th floor) with a fabulous view of the city. We could see Texas Stadium and the Capital Building from our room. The service at this hotel is first rate from the check-in to the housekeepers. Because we were on the Executive floor we were entitled to use the executive lounge which entitled us to a free breakfast (not fancy but very good except for the coffee). They have a reception each night but we chose to utilize the bar because of the selection of beers available. Because of necessary changes to the original reservation. The staff at the hotel made it easy to do so. Initially, they were going to have us change rooms after the first night but after talking to them, it was not necessary. Can you imagine having to change rooms?‚Ä¶"
5,Great hotel and wonderful location!,"Came here for a convention‚Äîeasy check in, nice large rooms, wonderful proximity to convention center and restaurants. Definitely recommend tho can be pricey/ night without a convention rate. Lots of places to eat as well as good restaurant and bar in the hotel."
4,Prime Texas Location,"Great place for a business meeting or your homebase to visit the sites or your sleeping headquarters after taking in a concert at Austin City Limits or the Sixth Street nightlife!!! I will admit even being high-up you could hear some of the street noise especially if there was a lot of bass - it was Friday night though.......this fact and the other factor of some aggressive panhandlers make me mark down the property - yes this is somewhat outside of the hotel's control, but it still should be noted that you are in a young urban environment."
3,Noisy,The hood is super noisy and 13 floors up I could hear the bass thumping for hours. Not a great location. The service was very good and room quality was super. Can‚Äôt stay here for business tho - not worth the noise factor.
4,My preferred Hilton property in Austin...,"A weekend stay at this Hilton property did not disappoint. The location is great - close enough to walk to everything, yet quiet enough for a good night‚Äôs rest. The hotel has been recently renovated, the rooms were clean, and the staff was super friendly and attentive. The Executive Lounge provided snacks, hours doeuvres, and continental breakfast. While it didn‚Äôt replace any meals, it kept us satisfied in-between. Parking is $32 a day, which is typical for downtown. I shall return, and highly recommend this property."
4,Good location & amenities,Excellent downtown location between 6th Street & Rainey Street. Great bar & Austin Taco Project restaurant. Cool pool & adequate spa facilities. Massage was nice. Rooms clean & comfortable. Would stay again.
5,Austin- Downtown Hilton = Super Combo = Value =Fun,"This one surprised me.Always had wanted to go to Austin TX- everyone raves about it. And I find I must agree.It‚Äôs one of the nicest Hiltons in the US with excellent service and a certain ‚Äòbounce‚Äô to it that makes you welcome.Stayed because of a conference.Plus/Pros-Super location and access to Convention Center and entertainment. It‚Äôs sleepy around noon but hopping after seven pm.- The newly renovated appearance and open airy design help making it feel more like a boutique hotel.-It is not one of those market-y loud convention hotels! Super.- Rooms are well appointed with easy access electric outlets to charge your computer/phone stuff- amazing light switches that help safe electricity- service: excellent - check final remark belowNegs/consNothing really as I am not the ‚Äònegative searcher‚Äô - realistically this team is doing its best to serve super well- it seems to be a young team still, thoughFINAL remark: my own Super Service AwardGoes to:PAMELA at the switchboard - she IS the EPITOME of professionalism. Needed room service at a particular time to allow dedicated work time (undisturbed!) - she arranged it and was the most helpful person whom I have encountered in a while- call it authentic.Doesn‚Äôt that make your traveling day?For this and All it‚Äôs 5+"
5,Comfortable rooms within walking distance of the main city hub.,"Although it is near the hi-way it was a quiet and comfortable stay in easy reach of music venues, either walking or by car/cab. Valet service on arrival/ departure was very helpful.The hotel (use only for emergency munchie moments) does have a shop for food/candy items but these are slightly pricey so fetch your own from in the cities own stores. It will save you a few bucks."
4,"Its a Hilton - its a cool Hilton, but its a Hilton.","So first thing - this hotel is in a super cool city, which immediately gives it a better chance than any hotel in Orlando from the get go. So it does have some advantages, but this is also a cool hotel - it is modern and what i would call 'well appointed', it is in a great location and it has a nice vibe to it. I think this place has managed to capture enough of what it means to be in Austin - they have good food, they have nice drinks, they have a touch of Texas without shovelling it on which is great, they have managed that difficult balancing act for these large scale American hotels which is to be sufficiently standard that tired corproate travellers get what they expect and dont feel too unusual about anything - whilst at the same time being sufficiently different to feel like you are in a specific place and relevant to the surroundings. I find that Hilton do a better job of this than Marriott who tend to err on the side of being over formulaic. So no complaints really - it is clean, it is well located, it is hip enough to make you feel like there is still some blood flowing through you, and it is comfortable.It is still a Hilton, so you get all the normal things you would expect, fairly standard furniture, fairly nasty carpets, but these are because they are running a big chain of hotels - i forgive them for this. i have no complaints.I am sure there are much hipper hotels in Austin, i would like to find them, this doesnt feel like i am in the center of things and Austin is such a cool and vibey city it would be good to be more boutique in my mind, but for a single night on a business trip you will not have any issues here."
5,Great hotel,"Last year when we visited it was under some construction but the location and amenities of this hotel are awesome. Just minute from 6th street and all the bars and restaurants, this is a prime spot and hotel. The rooms were comfortable and the beds just as nice. I would definitely stay there again."
5,A great hotel in a great location,"This is an excellent facility in a great location. The staff did a great job during my stay. The hotel is very conveniently located near the Austin Convention Center, as well as within walking distance of multiple restaurants in/near the 6th Street district."
4,Austin Hilton Awesome.,"This ranks up there in the top 10 for me of the many Hilton‚Äôs I‚Äôve stayed at. Staff were all super friendly and attentive to our needs. Rooms were good, Wifi excellent, fitness room one of the best I‚Äôve worked out in. Overall a class act Hilton. Put this one on your list."
5,Bachelorette Weekend in Austin,Planned my sister's bachelorette party here! It was amazing. All 17 of us had a great time and rooms were great. We stayed on the Executive Floor and had a great experience with the lounge. Well worth the extra cost. We even opened our bachelorette presents and hung out for a few hours before heading to Rainey Street in the Executive Lounge.
5,Great stay and awesome staff!,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband this past weekend. We went home for a reunion in Austin and preferred to stay downtown instead of with family. We were given a very nice room with a view of downtown and 2 queen beds. We were on the 17th floor and our room was very quiet. Great beds as is pretty standard with Hilton hotels. The hotel was very nice inside with an enormous lobby and several seating areas, Starbucks onsite, and large bar area for socializing. The hotel has a parking garage, so parking was convenient and connected to the hotel lobby. The best part of our stay was the staff. The people at the front desk were friendly, helpful (and had a sense of humor!) and I did not catch her name, but there was a woman near the front desk who said hello every time we walked by and asked if we needed anything. I will definitely stay again on future trips to Austin!"
2,"Nice, poor customer service","Having just witnessed the birth of our 1st grandson, my wife and I checked in here at 3:30am on Sunday morning. We asked about parking. They said our only options were $42 for valet or $32 for self parking. We had stayed here before knew we had parked for less, but couldn‚Äôt remember where. As it turns out, we could have parked literally next door at a city garage for $18, or on the street for free. Fortunately, they were sold out for the next night and moved to the nearby Omni Hotel. At the Omni, we were told about the free street parking upon arrival, as well as their valet and self-parking options.It‚Äôs not about where I decided to park, it‚Äôs about both the front desk and the valet guy at the Hilton, lying about our options.The Omni wins the day!!!"
5,Awesome Hotel & Staff!,"Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever, so lovely and great first impression of hotel ""Arjun"" Front Desk agent couldn't have been more sweet, giving me directions to places where I could go throughout my stay. As being a Gold Member he upgraded me to the Executive Floor, I want to congratulate Arjun for his MBA and also starting his internship in Austin. Wish you the best of luck. Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I dont give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, roomy with excellent service. Food was beyond good breakfast was awesome! Housekeepers are so nice and hardworkers. To the managers, and owner I would say you have a pretty good team members that truly make Hilton's a Great Hospitality! I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future! Keep up the hard work Hilton Austin!"
5,Perfect Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights between Xmas and NYE. The hotel is gorgeous and very well located, within walking distance to all parts of downtown Austin. To make things better, Jeremy at the FD was a big help throughout our stay. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again."
4,Special occasion stay,"We stayed for several nights to celebrate my wife's birthday and also Christmas day, the hotel and staff are excellent as expected at a Hilton property, and is a 5 star location, but sadly I can only provide 4 stars for the following reason, as stated this was to be a special occasion so I paid an upcharge to stay on the Executive floor and have access to the Executive lounge, well, the lounge was certainly not attended by executives, every morning and evening it was filled with families with several children literally mowing thru every morsel of food, apparently the lounge is not only open to executives, but any person with a hilton gold or higher membership, however the policy says the person renting the room and one guest, NOT a family of 7, this was very off putting and detracted a great deal from the experience we sought."
4,Comfortable Stay for New Years Holiday,"My husband and I had the opportunity to stay here over the New Years holiday. Overall, we really enjoyed it. Our room was comfortable and the location is walking distance to many restaurants and sites. Typically I find something negative to highlight but, in this case, nothing comes to mind. Enjoy your stay here at Hilton Austin!"
3,Highly Recommend,"I was in Texas for business, and at the last minute needed a hotel for one night. I walked rt in and was greeted with a warm hello. I really was impressed by the room especially the nice view I had. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the Austin area."
5,Great Hotel,"This hotel was very close to where we wanted to be. We were in walking distance to where we wanted to go. Close to all the action. The hotel was clean, the service was great. The hot chocolate was AWESOME."
5,Great Visit,"We had two rooms. Hotel was busy, but they upgraded us and put both rooms close to each other. My wife left her prescription glasses in the room. Chris Simmons in security went out of his way and overnighted the glasses to our home address without us being aware of it. It was a great surprise to find them in our mail box when we got home. That is what I call excellent service. Way to go Chris"
5,Great Property in Downtown Austin,"Due to a last-minute trip to the area, I was in need of a centrally-located hotel . . . and decided to give the Hilton Austin a try. Overall, I was very happy with my stay, and will definitely consider staying here when I'm back in the area.I was pleased with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. Nothing but smiles from the front desk to the executive lounge. Given the challenges of my day prior to check-in, this was truly a welcome sight.The room was quite comfortable, and offered up a nice view of the skyline. Self-parking was convenient, although the spaces were a bit cozy when compared to other parking garages.Even my son . . . who does his fair share of traveling . . . commented about how much he liked staying at this location. Nice job here, Hilton."
5,"Excellent hotel - super modern, great location and great fitness center",Stayed in this Hilton hotel for a few days after Christmas. It is a great location and is one of the best Hilton hotels I have ever used. Great amenities as well as great fitness center. We stayed on the Executive floor which gave us access to the Executive lounge. Service was great and all of the staff were super friendly.
5,Many thanks to this Austin Hilton Staff,"After a great stay for a business conference, I left a drawer of clothes in the room. Hilton security employee James Maloney tracked down my clothes in the hotel's lost and found and mailed them to me, no problem! I had a favorite shirt and a favorite hoodie in there! Thanks, James. And thanks to the rest of the staff, who made my stay friendly and relaxing."
5,Great service! Above and beyond!,Excellent customer service during our stay. The best is I left a favorite shirt in the room and didn't realize it until over 2 months later. I called the hotel and spoke to Jesus Loyalla in security. He was so helpful and patient and actually located my item and shipped it to my home. Great way to start 2018.
5,Great Location & Nice Hotel,"This hotel is in a perfect location to restaurants, bars (on 6th street) and other tourist attractions (like the State Capital, etc). It's very clean and modern. Loved our room and all the amenities. All the staff was extremely helpful. Would def recommend!"
5,"Good Value, Convenient Downtown Location","Centrally located hotel. Right across from light rail and bus transportation. Easy walking distance to restaurants, bars and live music. Also Red River Cultural District is nearby. Not a bad place to stay - comfortable rooms and easy access to all Austin has to offer."
5,exceeded expectations,I must say that since the beggining of my trip every detail was well taken care of from Chris Simmons from security that was very proffesional and attentive to our needs to Lisa (reception) and Jennifer (executive lounge) that treated us with personal care through our two week stay making this place feel like our home away from home. We are so grateful and will definitely be comming back next vacation.
5,Volleyball Trip,Ariana with the Concierge was awesome! Helped with reservations for a large group. Very helpful. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. Staff very friendly. Close to many restaurants and convention center. Great hotel.
3,Average accommodations,"The check-in process was excellent. The valet driver greeted us upon arrival although we didn't use the valet service. He advised us on parking within the below-ground garage, as we have a larger truck. Lisa checked us in and was very friendly. The room was average. I had pre-checked in on the Hilton App and chose a room on the 20th floor, however once we arrived (prior to the 3:00pm check-in time), we were given a room on the 14th floor. I was also under the impression the ""rooftop"" pool was actually on the rooftop. False advertising, it's on the 8th floor and doesn't have that great of a view. The hotel is within walking distance to the State Capitol and a block from 6th Street bars, restaurants, and shops."
3,"Was good, don‚Äôt get room service","Overall experience was cool. Nice rooms. Decided to get a steak dinner using room service, they told me an hour and a half wait (no problem). I went downstairs to get cash for a tip and when I came back apparently they already tried to deliver my food. I never knew this because they didn‚Äôt leave a note or message on the phone. I called them 2 hours later looking for the status on my food and she was super blunt and rude, saying she was there and I wasn‚Äôt. I said can you send the food back up, she said we will remake it. Little did I know she charged me for both times. $80 for a steak..... no. She didn‚Äôt even tell me that she was going to charge me again. I would have just paid for the first one and went somewhere else. That was my bad experience. Everything else is good. Rooms are awesome, front desk was awesome. This would have gotten 5 of 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for that experience."
1,One thing after another.,"The first thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the fact that when I made my first reservation, the rate was $119. A few days later, I had to add a night on. When I did that, the second night was $149 and it changed the first night to $149 also. I knew the rate would be different for the second night but I thought the first would stay the same. So I called and asked about it. The lady said there was nothing she could do about but she could put us in an executive room. She said to except it on line and the price difference would be adjusted. Then I had to end up canceling the second night after all. Then the rate went to $199.So I check in and of course the price was close to $400 for our 1 night in the executive room. I told the guy I didn‚Äôt want it and I was supposed to have the upgrade fee waved. So he just put us in a regular room. During the night, that room was so uncomfortable and hot. Nobody slept with even a sheet. I was going to call the front desk but then I didn‚Äôt want someone coming in the room while everyone was trying to sleep and half dressed. My husband also felt something on his stomach and looked and said something bit him.We were really looking forward to this stay. My husband doesn‚Äôt get to get away from work very often because he works for NASA and is the control room a lot. We were there because my oldest son graduated from the Tx Trooper academy so that gave us a reason to stay."
4,Great location and service,We stayed here while visiting our daughter and son in law over Christmas. The lobby area was decorated beautifully for the holidays. We had great customer service at this location from the front desk to wait staff and bartenders and valet. Our room was clean and spacious. They had a Starbucks in the lobby which was great in the mornings. We would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the area.
4,Comfy hotel ina great location.,The lobby of the hotel is nice and very convenient filled with lots of amenities. The staff were efficient and polite and got us to our room quickly. We enjoyed the spa/pool area but the hot tub is showing it‚Äôs age and is in major need of an overhaul. Room service was quick and tasted good. Checkout was easy and overall we had a nice stay. The location was great as well. 5 minutes walk to 6th St.
5,Great Weekend!,"Great Location, very clean and dog friendly! Was a very nice experience. Lisa was very nice when we were checking out and even gave us a coupon for Starbucks, very appreciated since it was Christmas Eve."
5,Great and modern hotel,The hotel lobby is beautiful and modern. The amenities are plentiful - it was a nice surprise to have a heated hot tub to use every morning. The rooms were clean and a good size - we did not feel crammed and we had four people to a room. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We were able to get a late checkout without a problem.
5,The best of the best,"Excellent accommodations, convenient location, great views of the city. If you're staying in Austin, you can't find a better place. We try to spend our anniversary there every year. We can walk to a variety of restaurants, clubs and not have to worry about taxis."
5,Great experience!,"My son and I stayed at the Hilton Austin while on vacation to visit friends and family. We enjoyed both restaurants in the hotel and having a Starbucks in the hotel was a great convenience. The complimentary hot chocolate put out in the evenings was a lovely surprise. I had two issues with my room and when I alerted the front desk the issues were not only addressed, but I was generously comped for my trouble. I felt genuinely cared for and Hilton definitely won my loyalty."
5,Fun,Amazing experience. The security guard Chris Simmons was awesome. He was friendly and helpful and always made sure the perimeter was secured!:) he always had a smile on his face and was willing to talk and brighten anybody's day up know matter who it was. He is a must keep employee I look forward to coming back and seeing him.
5,A great place to stay!,The great staff and excellent room made such a difference in my enjoyment of my stay here! The valets were very efficient and pleasant and the front desk staff keen on being helpful.Spacious room with a view of downtown and per my request a walk-in shower.Superb remote control of lights and room temperature!!! A very great feature!!!
5,"Awesome Hotel, Exceptional Customer Service!","This is by far one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in and the best in Austin. I called to see if I could check in early for my business trip and Pamela helped us out tremendously. She went above and beyond to make sure we had the premium WiFi at no extra cost, in addition to a free breakfast in the hotel‚Äôs restaurant. The rooms are gorgeous, spacious, and clean. Upon checkout, I left my SBA Loan paperwork (my home flooded in Hurricane Harvey) in my room‚Äôs safe. I didn‚Äôt realize this until I made it back to Houston. I called the hotel frantic and Chris Simmons in the lost and found department already had my paperwork and overnighted it to me at no charge! I am forever grateful! This is hands down the best customer service I‚Äôve ever received! You won‚Äôt be disappointed when you stay here!"
5,"Great location, great service!","This hotel is ideally located within walking distance to just about everything. The food was excellent, the service was top notch. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. The only downside is the parking $30 self parking is a bit pricey but seems to be the going rate. I will be back."
5,Great experience.,"I stayed a couple of nights at this property for business reasons. It is a beautiful facility--very new, well designed and contemporary. At the time, there was a convention going on and the hotel was at capacity. It handled the crowd beautifully. The staff was friendly, from the receptionist to the cheery lady working in the Executive Lounge when I popped in for a breakfast taco. The most impressive feat happened after I left, though. I left a personal item in my room when I checked-out, but didn't realize it until I was on a plane leaving town. I called the hotel, got transferred to the Security Department and talked to Chris Simmons. That dude tracked down my item ASAP, called me back immediately and then SENT IT TO ME OVERNIGHT. Amazing service. Above and beyond, for sure. I hope he has a Merry Christmas, he deserves it.Nice work, Hilton, I will definitely be back."
5,Best Place to Stay in Austin,"A great location in Austin, walking distance to everything in downtown. Excellent experience in hospitality. Easy to navigate to restaurants and bars throughout downtown. The rooms have the latest technology for internet and personal use"
5,Saved the Day! Great Customer Service & Extraordinary Staff,"I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton in Austin while attending a concert at the Frank Erwin Center. On the morning of check-out, I accidentally forgot my phone in the Starbucks located in the hotel's lobby. I was half way back to San Antonio when I realized I did not have my phone. I contacted the hotel's security staff and within a few minutes, they retrieved my phone and had it waiting at the front desk for me. Big thank you to Mr. Keith Foley & Mr. Chris Simmons for their help!"
5,Excellent overall,"The staff was friendly, the hotel is upscale, the rooms are modern and clean, the hotel is in a great location downtown. I had access to the lounge, and the offerings there were a bit more limited than I get from some hotels of this type, but decent. The breakfast at the restaurant was pretty good. Nothing to complain about for this stay."
5,Very good experience,I was here on business for one night. Very close to the downtown core (East 4th Avenue). Safe area. Hotel lobby is updated. Beds are comfortable with nice duvets. Water pressure was good. Parking was $30 per night.
5,Great Staff,"The best thing about this hotel is the staff, everyone was friendly, helpful, and always made you feel welcome. From the moment you check in to the time you leave they make you feel right at home. The rooms are big and clean, the hotel is walking distance to tons of great restaurants, bars and the river. Thank you so much!"
5,Great Hospitality and Location,"I chose this hotel because of it's proximity to a conference I was attending. From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted and directed to the reception area. My room was clean and had all the essentials except for a frig and microwave. The concierge was pleasant and helpful on the last day of checkout when I needed them to hold my bags while attending the conference. Uber, Lyft and Taxis were all available and offered services from this hotel. It was a cold rainy/snowy week and the roasted squash soup hit the spot while waiting in the bar for the next event."
5,Excellent Staff,The staff at the hotel is excellent. I hurt my back while in Austin and could not leave the hotel room. The staff picked up my medication for me and Chris Simmons brought me a new key and ice pack when I had to extend my stay. I will definitely stay here again. Rooms were clean and comfortable.
5,Great hotel experience a street away from the Austin Convention Center,"I traveled to Austin to take part in a conference. It was my first time in the city and I had no particular expectations. It was a great experience to meet the friendly Hilton staff on my way in, who provided lots of suggestions for dining and doing a walk-around tours later on the same day."
5,Staff was excellent,I got sick on my visit and the concierge went to the pharmacy for my to get my prescriptions. It was a life saver. In general all staff were incredible. Their helpfulness saved me so much time in the end. Was very useful since I was traveling for busines.
5,Excellent location for touring Austin,"Ditch the car; you won‚Äôt need one when staying here. The hotel offers a central location, with easy walking to Austin‚Äôs popular sites and attractions. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed. Ours had a great view out toward the airport. The front desk staff are helpful and generous with the recommendations, which was appreciated since this was my first trip to Austin.My only criticism was housekeeping didn‚Äôt stop by the room until @230pm, which was just after we returned from touring around all morning and wanted to get refreshed. So we ended up passing on the service."
4,Decent,"Pretty good business class hotel. My only criticism is that they have shower curtains in the shower (I prefer shower doors). But, the hotel is clean and the service is good. Wifi is super fast and easy to use. I'd stay here again."
5,Great location in Downtown Austin,"Great time and location in downtown Austin. Staff was very helpful. Cabs are always waiting. Easy to get to entertainment, bars, restaurants and historic sites. Would highly recommend the Downtown Hilton"
5,"Awesome hotel, great location!","This is large hotel, that doesn't feel like a large hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious, and never too far of a walk from an elevator. All staff I encountered was friendly and welcoming! Housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping our rooms neat and tidy. When I asked for non-feather pillows, they were delivered promptly. Very friendly staff and great selection in the Executive Lounge. Room Service was timely and delicious, and the Lobby Bar bartender was welcoming and made us some very tasty drinks! Overall great experience with all of the hotel staff. The location of this hotel is also amazing, with everything you would need in Austin within walking distance. I will definitely be returning!!"
5,Company Christmas Party,"Our Company had their Christmas at this Hilton, we had a great time. The room was clean and comfortable, breakfast in the executive lounge was good and the staff was friendly and helpful when we needed recommendations for things to do in the area. Within walking distance of 6th street if that is your thing. We will be staying here again when me and my wife come for a weekend get away."
4,Beautiful hotel if you must be downtown,"I was so looking forward to showing my family the Austin I knew and loved. Unfortunately, the Austin I lived in 8 years ago is no more. We chose a 6th street hotel to be centrally located and within walking distance to some good restaurants. 6th St. has become more like New Orleans' Bourbon St. or Chicago's Rush St., jus bar after bar after bar. If you don't want to pay $22 for the hotel breakfast buffet in the lobby, there are precious few options to walk to in the neighborhood. Expect to be accosted by aggressive homeless people. And the construction on literally every corner will make you want to stay in your room. The pool deck is great, although the one evening we were able to enjoy the hot tub, there was a gold grill hoochie mama endlessly filming sexy selfies with a loud and obnoxious music track as though we weren't even there."
3,Nice hotel,"Pros Nice Hilton. Good hotel, right off 6th street and just off Congress (downtown). Check in staff somewhat friendly. Good viewsCons. Check in system was working very slowly. Hotel staff at bar not very friendly (almost rude when they asked my daughter's age - 17 then promptly asked and then told us she could sit at the bar but could at a table). Wifi in room sucked. No sundry shop and no vending machines - how is one to get an M&Ms treat at 10:00 at night?Parking a pain and pricey. Worst while we saw maids in the hall they didn't clean our room (there 2 nights)"
