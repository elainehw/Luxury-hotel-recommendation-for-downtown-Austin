4,"A traditional hotel, convenient, excellent service","The age of the hotel shows in the decor (much red etc) but everything is impeccably clean and all the modern comforts are there. A good bathroom with all amenities, a closet and drawers etc etc. Very friendly and efficient service. The restaurant in not at the level of the hotel, not for menu or atmosphere, and the breakfast has the normal things but nothing superb."
5,Amazing stay!,"I absolutely LOVED this hotel! It is beautiful, perfectly located and the staff is wonderful. It was everything I hoped it would be. There is a great balcony on the second floor off the bar. You can hang out there, have breakfast there, anything. It overlooks the State Capital."
5,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here last weekend and was very impressed with the hotel, the cleanliness and most of all the service. I'd like to especially recognize Caroline who helped us at check-in and check-out at the front desk. She did an excellent job making sure our stay went well. Everyone at the front desk, valet and bellmen were all so helpful and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again."
4,Love Austin,I have been going to Austin on business for years and always raved about it when I got home to Toronto.My wife was sold and asked me to take her . great music great food and the InterContinental is in the center of it all.Make sure that you go see the bats at dusk!
1,Worst customer service ever.,"I have been all over the world and stayed in many hotels but this one takes the cake for worst hotel for customer service. It started with the check in. We arrived on a busy weekend and from the minute we arrived at the front desk we were apologized to at least twenty times for the amount of time we had to wait to get checked in, even though we had a reservation. Clearly unprepared for a busy day. It didn't get any better from there. The continental breakfast consisted of some juice and some toast all for the low price of $25. Ridiculous. On our last day, the maid came in and broke my laptop. We had it charging on the hotel provided chargers in between the two beds on the nightstand. This area was entirely too small to be charging electronic devices but we had no choice as no outlets were located next to the desk. Go figure. Apparently the maid knocked the computer off the nightstand and then put it back in hopes that no one would notice the giant cracked screen. When I brought it to the managers attention they simply said they would investigate it and then turn it over to the insurance company. Fast forward a month... claim denied and I am out $1700 for a replacement laptop. With the three night stay costing roughly $1000, my cost for the weekend stay and one computer was $2700. Just a bit pricey. To top it all off the room refrigerator also charged us for item we didn't even use. You heard me right, the refrigerator automatically charges you when you remove an item. Even if you put it back the fridge stills charges you. They fill the fridge so you cant put any personal items in it without removing their stuff. That is shady business. Overall, one star is far too much for this place."
4,Austin visit,"Not my first time in Austin but my first at this hotel. An older building but the inside was fairly modern and in pretty good shape with a very friendly and helpful staff that took really good care of myself and my party. The bedroom was also a little dated but once again very clean and a comfortable bed. Same can be said of the bathroom, very clean but I wish there was a stand alone shower and not just a tub.The location was also very good and right in the thick of some good restaurants and entertainment.Overall a very decent place to stay"
5,Block of room experience,Erica A was an amazing blend of professional and personal (working with her to secure a block of rooms). Her communication skills and proactive actions were above and beyond. The results of our guests' stays exceeded all expectations and lended to a hugely successful weekend event! Could not have asked for a more superior experience.The actual stay was perfect too. The staff and facilities were SO much above the standard. Fabulous hotel!
5,Austin Intercontinental,"Convenient location, clean, comfortable and pleasant staff. The booking on trip advisor was easy and the hotel was exactly as I expected it would be. We were within walking distance of many of our planned activities which was very nice."
5,Weekend get away trip,"I did Expedia last minute travel and found this gem of a hotel. I booked a day before leaving, not my style but my other planned weekend getaway got cancelled so thought we would try something new. So glad we did. I called first to find out hotel information and spoke to Ryan at the front desk. He gave me so much awesome info I was sold. Hotel was great but the service was better. The hotel itself is in the best location. Gym was awesome too! I think Austin is an amazing city, it was our first time and we would go back in a minute and stay at the this hotel. Huge thanks to Ryan, we appreciated all your help and knowledge."
5,An oasis of calm,"We spent two nights here at the start of our holiday in Texas. The room was spacious and well appointed with plenty of towels, toiletries, pillows and comfy seating. The coffee machine was in the cupboard under the tv (I nearly missed it!). The bed was great as was the shower. We had a room on the 11th floor and I have to say, it was the quietest hotel I’ve stayed in. We didn’t hear a peep from the traffic below or from other guests. I didn’t even put my earplugs in (this is unprecedented). The gym was good. The staff were excellent - very friendly, cheerful and helpful. It’s a great location, totally central and easy to get to. Austin does have a very obvious problem with street homelessness as well as a very lively cultural and social scene, all of which creates an intense atmosphere - the intercontinental feels wonderfully calm and tranquil by comparison."
5,Nice hotel in a great location,"The location near the Capitol, 6th Street, and everything else in Downtown Austin is awesome. Staff is very warm and inviting and the rooms are nicely appointed and clean. Wife loved the separate makeup counter and the shelves next to the sink. Having the shelves allowed us to keep everything on the pedestal sink.Overall, great experience for staying in downtown Austin."
5,Weekend getaway and proposal,I asked the hotel to decorate my room for by beautiful fiancee. I proposed to her earlier that day. Not only did they make this happen they went above any expectation I have ever had. Thank you for everything!!!
5,Our extra special experience,"We had the BEST stay at the Intercontinental in Austin!The check in with James was extra ordinary!He went out of his way to be extra helpful and caring. He also gave us a great room with a great view!!! We used to stay at the Four Seasons, but we will be staying there from now on! ARodney at the front was also super!!They both kept us hydrated with waters coming and going!!!"
3,Bad service experience,"Great downtown ATX location for a weekend staycation. However, my room was never cleaned even after making a special concierge request AND money left for housekeepiing tip was gone. No bed made, room service tray not removed, nothing. Group of friends came from bar to room for birthday drinks. Not a good advertisement for hotel service."
3,we expected more for a Four stars hotel,"Great central location, nice clean room... but it's very dated, it needs a make overs. It's bit old fashion but without the charm of The Four Seasons.It's average hotel within this price range, we expected more."
5,A Terrific Experience at the Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin,"After a late flight from Chicago, I was exhausted when I arrived at the Intercontinental. The short trip from the Austin airport was a relief and the hotel's main floor is elegant. My room was exceptionally beautiful and the bed was so comfortable, it was like being at home in my own bed. The accommodations were lovely and the location was convenient. I will definitely stay there when I return to Austin."
5,Always a great stay!,I’ve stayed here a couple of times and each visit has been great! Great downtown location and amazing customer service - everyone is beyond friendly and helpful! Terry with the front desk (phone) crew was awesome - thank you again!!! I’ll definitely be back!
5,Memorable Stay!,"This is a very beautiful historic hotel. It is clean, comfortable and the staff was SUPER friendly. We stayed in a room where the windows opened up to a view of the Texas Capital. Stunning! There were lots of restaurants nearby with a vibrant night life. Beautiful nature trails provide a break from the rush of the city. We hope to stay at the Intercontinental some time in the future!"
5,Excellent stay!,Very hospitable hotel and extremely accommodating. We love the location and ease of access. We must have called down to the reception 8 times asking for items and recommendations and they were so helpful each time. Will definitely be back next year!
5,Great birthday weekend,"My boyfriend brought me to the Intercontinental for my birthday. I was blown away by the elegance of the hotel. It has this old world charm in the middle of the bustling city. We had dinner at the hotel’s restaurant and the food was delicious. The location of the hotel is perfect, we were walking distance from some great restaurants and bars. It was the perfect night and I was so impressed by my boyfriends choice in hotel! I would definitely recommend staying here."
5,Great property!,The staff was very attentive at this very nice downtown property. The view of the capital from our room was an added bonus. The charm of the historic building coupled with the location and the wonderful staff - make this an awesome place to stay.
5,Great stay!,"The hotel was right downtown, very easily accessible via bus or uber/lyft from the airport and to attractions we wanted to explore! We had to book a room last minute and Ryan at the front desk was incredibly nice and helpful during this stressful time. The property is very nice and the breakfast buffet was delicious. We would definitely look into staying at this property again if we return to the area- thank you so much again Ryan!"
5,Wonderful hotel,"Fabulous hotel- historic building. We had a view of the capital building. Friendly, helpful staff. Comfortable room. Can’t wait to visit again. Lots of eating and drinking establishments all around the hotel. Music venues, shopping and museums also nearby."
5,Excellent Service!,"Ok, it was just amazing! I really loved the check in (fast and efficient) and all the personal was really nice, i recommend it for sure!since my arrival everyone welcomed me with smiles, all the staff is very helpful. check in was fast, the room was in excellent condition, I loved the view and the restaurant food was delicious."
5,The Best Hotel!,"My experience at the hotel was excellent, it surpassed my expectations. Carmen at the front desk was very helpful and always with an smile. She should be an example to the service industry for those who has lost the service touch."
5,Truly excellent hotel!!!,"The hotel was very clean. The staff was truly amazing. I have stayed in many hotels and this is by far the nicest one. IHG is the best. Special thanks to the friendly front desk staff, bar, house keeping, security and valet. 🥰"
5,Great Location & Helpful Staff,"Love this place! Beautiful & classic interior, with a GREAT bar (and patio) right in the heart of downtown Austin. Hosted a corporate workshop in their meeting space - stellar customer service from valets and bellhops all the way up to catering and event staff. VIP guests from out of town were impressed with the hotel, as well."
5,Ryan is the best!!!,"This is our third visit and Ryan always smiles and remembers us by name every time! He makes us feel so welcome. His meticulous attention to detail is what keeps us coming back! The hotel is in the middle of all the action, come experience the magic!"
5,Delightful introduction to Austin!,"Historic and very elegantly restored hotel in the heart of downtown Austin--close to shops and boutiques, restaurants, clubs, bars, bats bridge, and the capitol building; UT-Austin campus and LBJ's presidential library and museum are close enough to walk. The trendy and bohemian So-Co area south of the river is a short car ride away. Although the hotel dates from the 1920s, it has been beautifully and lovingly restored and updated with all modern amenities, yet retains old world elegance. Rooms are luxurious, guest products in bathroom are of high quality, terry-cloth bathrobe and skippers make you feel like a million bucks! Although we did not use it, the lap pool and gym seem more than adequate for those who might want to use them. The staff could not be more helpful, professional, friendly, and accommodating if they wanted to! From the helpful valet staff members, to the front desk (regardless of hour), to the restaurant and bar servers and room/housekeeping staff--all were always courteous and went out of the way to meet all our needs. In 6 nights, we literally never had to once open the door of our car to get in or out or the front door of the hotel to come and go! During our stay, we had a one-night visit from relatives who stayed in a different room, but had a small dog--the hotel was very welcoming of the pet and even provided recommendations for pet-friendly areas and restaurants nearby. The second floor veranda is a wonderful place for happy hour or a late-night drink and the view of the street below allows for great people watching and taking in urban life downtown. Now that we will have the opportunity to visit Austin more frequently, we will definitely make this our hotel in Austin!"
3,"""PET FRIENDLY""? I DON'T THINK SO.","I have stayed at the Intercontinental several times over the past 5 years. I go to Austin 6-7 times a year to visit my children. This past weekend I was extremely disappointed. First, due to a parade we were unable to get to the valet and had to park one street over using a meter, which would expire in the middle of the night. I understand the hotel had nothing to do with the parade, but it would have been nice to get some kind of notification. The real issue is that we booked our room through Priceline (which we have done many times). We chose the Intercontinental because of the rate and we had stayed there before while visiting. We were also looking for a ""Pet Friendly"" hotel this visit, which the Intercontinental advertised they were. Two weeks prior to this visit we stayed at another hotel in Austin which advertised ""Pet Friendly"" and we checked in with our 7 lb. maltipoo which they greeted and helped up to our room with a very easy checkin. However, this stay at the Intercontinental, we were told there was a $100 pet deposit (WHICH WAS NOT REFUNDABLE) and had to complete a paper that was a bit excessive for our 7 lb. maltipoo. BASICALLY THEY CHARGE YOUR PET $100 TO STAY THERE. The gentleman checking us in, Sebastian, became very rude when we questioned the $100 deposit. No where did we see there would be an $100 pet deposit. If we would have been aware of the pet deposit, we would have stayed at another hotel. At this point we were too tired and just paid and checked in. The room was nice. We ordered room service which was good. However, if you want a ""Pet Friendly"" hotel this is not it. There are many other hotels in Austin that do not require a pet deposit to stay that are equally as nice if not nicer."
4,An Alternative to the Cookie-cutter Modern Behemoths,"I stayed here for two nights while attending a conference in another, larger, hotel down the street, and was happy to have done so. The desk staff were exceptionally helpful as I worked out credit card hiccups. My room, while on the small side, was perfect for my needs and very clean. The gym was well-equipped and clean. It was nice to stay in a historic Austin landmark."
2,"Not 4 star quality, wouldnt stay here again","I don't understand how this hotel has 4 stars. I have stayed in most of the hotels in downtown Austin and this place is a dump. Rooms are old and small, the bed is extremely hard and uncomfortable, AC never got cold, tiny windows, no view, no balcony, no outdoor pool, no amenities deck. Compared 4 stars places like the JW or Fairmont... well this place is closer to a courtyard in quality. If your planning an Austin getaway I would avoid this hotel."
5,WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!,Ryan was very professional!! Beautiful location!! We were here for a business trip and I was definitely impressed with the level of courtesy and professionalism that was displayed! You all are definitely worthy of a five star rating!
2,CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND IN THE BED,On the king bed there was a blood stain and a blood stain on the comforter. My business partner found a used bandaid and a used piece of gum in the pull out couch. We were disgusted by this so had both beds changed. Front desk offered us two drink tickets which was a pathetic way to apologize so we are definitely not staying here again. Valet was $42 a night which is a total rip off so there is a public parking garage half a block away so park there and don't waste your money.The hotel is in a great location so its perfect for walking to 6th street.
5,Bedst Hotel in Downtown Austin!,"I booked a group of 12 people to stay at the Austin Intercontinental Hotel after getting a great group rate. We have one of our plants in nearby Georgetown where we bring in people from all across the country and this was the first time we booked the Intercontinental. Every one of our guests commented on how they loved the rooms and hotel experience but especially the comfortable beds! With this hotel being right in the middle of downtown Austin you can't go wrong, walking distance to so many great restaurants and of course the live music scene on 6th street. My compliments to the hotel staff and management team, as a result we are looking to have this hotel be the first choice for our all future guests."
4,Wedding Anniversary Hotel Stay,"We stayed one night at the Stephen F Austin for our wedding anniversary. Our room was beautiful, overlooked Congress and could see the Paramount and the capitol building. We had dinner at this delicious Italian restaurant right on Congress, Quattro then had drinks at the hotel up on the 2nd floor patio overlooking the Congress Avenue. Great service, indoor pool was small but clean and empty, hot tub was nice. We would go back again."
5,"10/10, would stay again","Wanted a good deal for the night and even though we had to checked into the hotel in the middle of the night, Sebastian G was very helpful and accommodating.....found some broken glass in the room, no big deal."
1,Room not ready,"Rooms not ready at check in time. Out of control management. Last time for Intercontinental. People sitting all over the lobby and no where to go. Offered me points, joke. Almost $400 for a night and the front desk was a mess. On the positive side, the valet guys were great and the ambassador checkin/concierge was great!Got to the room and it was the size of a postage stamp."
4,"Nice hotel, but many extra charges","We stayed here for the night of 4th of july. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and we got a huge room on the 6th floor. Room was clean and had all the necessities. The hotel itself is really beautiful, but they charge you for everything. The valet parking cost $45 a night, so I would probably recommend trying to find a self-park somewhere close. Also there is no free internet unless you join the rewards program, however that is free, so just do it unless you want to pay $15. Breakfast can be delivered to your room for an extra charge."
5,THE place to stay in Downtown Austin - Heart of Texas,"Hotel:Location – In the heart of Texas capital, literally blocks from and in line-of-sight of the Capital Building, the Stephen F Austin is in an ideal location for a weekend get-a-way or an extended stay in the vibrant downtown area. We chose the SFA as the host hotel for our daughter’s wedding. It was walking distance to all venues (if any chose to go on foot) and is surrounded with city parks, lake lined running paths, attractions, sightseeing, and restaurants for the guest’s downtime. It was the perfect hub for the wedding rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, welcome party, wedding service, reception, and post reception gathering.Ambiance – Many hotels claim they have the most current technologies and conveniences, but the SFA truly does, plus the relaxing feel and warmth of an inviting classic hotel. The blend of dark wood and warm colors greet you and invite you into the common areas. You can feel the historic past as you walk through the doors.Amenities – The hotel has all the amenities necessary for a private weekend get-away, a conference, and special group events. We were there with a group of guests for a wedding. The SFA was the perfect Host Hotel for the Wedding Party and guests. There is space for private moments, as well as, fabulous locations within the hotel for group gatherings that allowed old friends to catch up on the latest events in their life. One feature, that stood out as special for us, was the second floor porch, outside the bar, that wraps around the corner of the hotel, providing the ideal setting for small group conversations while taking in the Austin downtown nightlife and State Capital.Service Staff – From the valet to the desk to cleaning/bus staff, everyone was welcoming. They were attentive without being underfoot, in your way, or with a hand out for a gratuity, although their service quality invited special recognition. Texas charm shined from the greeting to the last ‘thank you and hope you enjoyed your stay’.Management – Management was extremely easy to work with throughout all phases of the planning, contracting, and executing our Host Hotel stay. They were very responsive to our questions and quickly addressed any concerns. They were flexible and worked with us on the few unexpected situations that occurred, like storing the wedding cake that remained after the reception. Management is truly first class professionals.Room:Décor/Esthetics – The rooms were very inviting with just the right amount of furniture and decoration. The motif keeps with the historic Texas up-scale classic feel. The room (and the lobby) might transport you back to a period where you are attending a cattle barons ball or enjoying the 1920’s speakeasies just down the street: all this while realizing you are in a first class 21st century establishment.Functionality – The rooms are a great size. My family stayed in four different room configurations. They were each perfect for their need. The room layout was done with functionality in mind and furnishings were carefully placed to maximize the use of space while providing a natural flow through and around the area. There was the right amount of empty/vacant space so as not be wasteful but provide a feeling of a home rather than that of a hotel. The rooms are current with technology- providing elements like tabletop contact device chargingQuietness – Without question, our room was the quietest room we have ever been in. On the corner of the hotel’s 9th floor overlooking busy Congress Avenue there was ample opportunity for it to be noisy. I am not sure what they did architecturally, but we never heard any outside noise or any inside conversation or footsteps. All of our friends staying in the hotel said the same thing.Cleanliness - Having travelled across the USA, Canada, and to Europe, I have stayed in many hotel rooms and I have to say our room was one of the most, if not the most, clean room we have stayed. Usually even in the best hotels I seem to find some item / evidence that reminds me that someone was here before me; however, our room looked and felt like we were the first guest.All around recommended as a place to stay."
5,Faultless stay,"This is a great hotel in the heart of Austin. Good sized rooms, great amenities in rooms and fast and pleasant service throughout! Not a single flaw or blimp in the stay - I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Austin !"
5,"Everything is Top Notch - The Service, The Rooms, The Stay - EVERYTHING!","The location just happens to be perfect, right in the heart of downtown Austin. But it's the staff and service that keeps bringing me back. The rooms are great, the food is awesome, but the people are superb!"
4,Another Fine Intercontinental Property,"This is a very nice hotel and more importantly, the staff is well trained to provide excellent guest service. The are professional, effective and accommodating. Especially nice is the lounge on the mezzanine floor which has an outdoor patio. It is a few short steps to 6th Stree which is convenient. The Paramount Theatre is next door and there is always a movie or event worth seeing."
5,southern hospitality,"This historic hotel has a great location and displays all that is best in southern hospitality from the moment you arrive, to the chocolate left in the turn down service, to the valet parking. In particular jose and vinnie in the club lounge go above and beyond to see that guests have a memorable experience. A great place to stay for business or pleasure."
5,Love this hotel!!,"Love this hotel! Every time I'm here it feels like home. The staff is incredible, the rooms are comfortable, and it's also one of my favorite smells! It's perfect locations makes it easy to access all of the best spots in downtown Austin (including the State and Paramount Theatres and amazing restaurants). Also, Stephen F's bar is one of my favorites in Austin, and the outside patio has the best views of the city."
5,We keep coming back...,"We love the SFA and visit it a couple of times of year but our favorite time to visit is during a television festival each June. Over the last 7 years of staying here the hotel has refurbished and upgraded on many levels and it continues to tweak its services to meet each guest's needs.Even with a conference going on and people milling about in the lobby and along the grand staircase it is still easy to find a staff person to help with whatever one might need. Which leads me to what I think is probably the biggest selling point for this hotel—the staff plus so many of the staff members (bellhops, wait staff, housekeeping, lead staff) have been there for each of our visits over the past seven years. They are extraordinary people friendly yet totally professional-- I'm hoping that besides being a great place for guests to stay it is also a great place to work because why else with all the high end hotels appearing in Austin would they stay for so many years?The rooms are super comfy and come in all sizes depending on what your budget might be, the second floor bar is a great place to hang out and meet people-- especially if you can snag a table on the balcony with a view of South Congress and the beautiful capitol building, the Roaring Fork has several delicious dishes and great bartenders. All and all it's a great hotel with a fantastic location-- 2 blocks from the capitol (go and walk around inside), 2 blocks from Sixth Street (live music and a taste of what makes Austin weird), a mile from the heart of South Congress which takes you over the bridge where the bats live (bridge is 5 blocks from hotel). Just watch out for the electric scooters because they aren’t watching out for you.I usually include some minus points in my reviews so that readers know that I'm paying attention-- previously for this hotel it was the elevators but they have been zipped up and there is rarely a wait for access. I guess the only complaint I heard was from my husband who wasn't thrilled with the lobby coffee but was perfectly happy with the coffee in the club cafe...but I can’t give my opinion on that. My 5 star rating stands strong."
5,This place is home to me...,"I truly cannot say how much I love this hotel and their staff. I've been staying there for 8 years and host major events there. From the bar staff (sweet Peter), to the catering team (amazing Julie), to the sales team (dear dear Danelle), it is just an unbelievable team that manages to feel boutique but also part of a bigger brand. It also manages to feel very much local/Texas, but with non of the downside or missed amenities. Do yourself a favor and stay there..."
5,Club InterContinental & Stephen F’s Bar are on point!,This was my first time coming to the ATX festival and staying at the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin. The hotel was beautiful and the staff was delightful. My friend and I had a club room and experienced exceptional service in the Club InterContinental by Jose Luis. We kicked off each evening with delicious appetizers while being wonderfully taken care of by Jose Luis. We’d then head up to relax out on the patio of Stephen F’s Bar where Steve would greet us with a big smile and spectacular service. I can’t wait to return next year!
5,Best Place to Stay in Downtown Austin,"We spent two days in Austin and this hotel worked out great. The staff are WONDERFUL and some of the most polite in the industry. We had a couple of special request and they were handled with impressive action. The InterContinental Club is this great oasis in the bustle of Austin--of note was Luis who was very accommodating and and was so helpful. Luis made the Club look great and still found time to connect with the guests--it was impressive.The rooms are spacious, though the hotel could you some updates in the public areas. Parking is valet only (normal in Austin), but the parking staff are very prompt.The location and the Staff make this the best place to stay in Downtown Austin"
4,Paramount Saturday,The check-in and check-out process was easy despite a TV festival convening near the hotel. I received a room on the sixth floor near the elevators. The room was small but quiet. You needed to close the door to the room to open the closet door in the narrow entryway.The was a robe and a safe in the closet. The decor is a red pattern accent wall with the remainder of the room was off-white. The queen sized bed with a high black headboard with a star in the center was the focal piece. A black sideboard functioned as the TV stand and mini-bar. The bathroom was small with numerous amenities on glass shelves. We were able to partake of the pool and whirlpool which we had to ourselves. The location of course is prime so we wandered around for meal different options instead of dining at the hotel because it was so busy. The coffee offered in the lobby is the best option because the in-room keurig produced a strange cup.
5,Wonderful post wedding brunch,We spend a wonderful morning with our family and friends after the wedding of my cousin. The food was delicious especially the granola and omelette. The staff was kind and attentive and met all of our requests. Would definitely recommend it!
5,ATX TV Festival,This was our first time to stay here during the television festival as we usually stay at the JW Marriott. I’m so happy we finally stayed here! The location is super convenient for the festival and the accommodations are great. The room is super clean/comfortable and the club accommodations are fantastic. We absolutely loved meeting José Luis who took fantastic care of us! He makes a fantastic cocktail and you can tell he genuinely loves his job. We can’t wait to come back next year and plan to stay here for every festival going forward.
4,Very Good Hotel,Stayed in this hotel in January. We arrived in the early hours but check in was very efficient. Good size room and very clean. Breakfast was very good and had dinner in the restaurant (Roaring Fork) on one evening which was also a good experience. Great atmosphere in both bars in the evening. Staff are friendly and professional. Excellent downtown location.
5,Really Enjoyed,"Spent three nights here at Easter. Rooms can be smallish like any older hotel but public spaces are very nice. Staff were fabulous, especially Sally. The location is also great. Easy walk to Sixth Street, to the river, to South Congress and other attractions. I would stay again."
5,A few days in austin,The hotel is extremely nice inside and on arrival we got an upgrade. Rooms very comfortable air conditioned very clean and tidy. We were on a room only basis so can't comment on the food etc. This hotel is well placed in the city if you like walking with good restaurants and bars close by. I would recommend it as a base. The staff at check in and checkout very professional.
5,May Favorite,"The Stephen F. Austin InterContinental is my favorite place to stay in Austin. Right in the heart of the great places to eat, the Roaring Fork in the Hotel, my favorite bar upstairs with a great patio! Love this place!"
2,"Nice room, leaking air conditioner in room","Decent Hotel in need of repair and interior renovation. Pleasant staff. The stay started well with a spacious room and welcome champagne for our anniversary. Soon after arrival we noted that the drawers in the dresser would not stay closed.That was just weird. But the dresser was ""leaning"" away from the wall. And the drawers would simply not stay closed. We were surely not anticipating a leak from the ceiling due to air conditioner malfunction. Even though staff ""fixed"" it when we needed to be getting ready for dinner, the leak recurred while we were asleep. So we awoke to a large pool of water just inside our door. Management fix for this was extra points on our rewards account. Evidently this was a consistent problem,s because as we were checking out the maintenance staff who repaired our room was exiting a neighboring room with their ladder and tools. Just disappointing all around."
4,Problems with Night Manager,In Town of my daughter's graduation from UT. I have stayed at this very nice downtown property multiple times. The housekeeping staff woke us up at eleven thirty stating the room was empty. Then the night manager insisted I come down and recheck in because they didn't show me checked into the room. Which I had completed done the previous day at check in and signed all the documents and given a credit card.
4,Not Quite,"Generally a good+ stay, with a couple of nits:1. Parking fee is exorbitant.2. Inexplicably, the room was not made up one day (even though staff had entered for turndown service).3. Had to request guaranteed one-level room upgrade as an Ambassador. .Otherwise, about what one should expect from an IC in terms of quality and staff."
5,HISTORICAL GEM IN DOWNTOWN AUSTIN,"The ""SFA"" as we call it is one of my wife's and my favorite hotels even though we live right here in Austin. Frequently when we will be enjoying our local nightlife downtown, especially on consecutive nights, we elect to stay here and avoid the drives. The staff is excellent and very friendly. The second floor bar, with its balconies overlooking the street life, and its phenomenal bar staff, is one of our favorite haunts. The Roaring Fork restaurant, with its own vibrant bar, is excellent but VERY popular. Reservations are all but essential.The rooms are great, but the suites are fantastic. In a variety of sizes, they all share historically classy decor and great views. And of course, the SFA's location is spectacular; walking distance from all the highlights of downtown Austin. It is our ""home away from home' when we want to spoil ourselves!"
5,"Beautiful hotel, great swrvice",Stayed here for a work conference. The hotel staff was super friendly and accommodating. The room was the perfect size for 1 and had all amenities. The bar in the hotel was an added bonus. It’s conveniently located within walking distance of lots of restaurants and things to do.
5,"Great travel experience -- and major props to the head engineer, Jorge!","I have been staying in this hotel for years, fabulous property and location. With a friendly and highly responsive front desk - that, for me, is a major yardstick on hotels. My recent visit to the Stephen J. affirmed, yet again, why I love this hotel staff so much: Upon check-in to the room, my A/C was stuck on 62-degrees. Called the front desk, within minutes the head engineer, Jorge, showed up, ladder and tool box in hand. He diagnosed the problem - the compressor had gone bad -- and did the fix immediately. (By then the front desk had already offered to move me to another room, but I was so impressed by Jorge's courteousness and efficiency I stayed put!) Over the next few days, Jorge followed up with me several times, to make sure everything was working properly. He also left me a very nice handwritten note at the front desk, to apologize again for the inconvenience (not his fault, obviously!) and thank me for my patience and patronage. Total class move. I was so impressed. Also reminded me, once again, why I love this hotel and its amazing staff so much!"
4,Great location...although better options are available!,"I visited this hotel for a work function, so for that purpose it was a good choice. However, if you plan to visit Austin, there are better choices available at this price range. The location was 1 block from the famous 6th Street. Conveniently located near retail stores, restaurants and bars. Service was exceptional but the hotel itself isn't anything out of this world and could use a face lift. One word of caution is walking to and from 6th at night...then again walking anywhere on 6th at night is a risk. So be cautious of your surroundings."
2,Damaged vehicle,I had a great trip to Austin and a decent stay at the hotel but after just checking out my husband noticed a scratch to his truck. We paid 100$ for 2 nights of valet services and in return now have to repair damages clearly caused by the valet team. My husband called and spoke with the valet manager Rudy who showed no concern and only stated that we should have said something soon. We called and reported the damaged less than an hour after checking out once we saw it. He recommended we return to see the garage and proceeded to tell us how large it was and the likely hood of damage was minimal. We asked what was the process for reporting the damage and Rudy's response was just come back and he would file a police report. We are not from Austin and when we return we will not be staying at the intercontinental. This is due to the lack of accountability and care for patrons. I do not expect the company will provide resolution but hopefully all who do stay will check for damage before leaving valet!
5,TERRIFIC property at which to host a professional meeting!,"WOW! Where to begin!? From the moment I got the proposal from the sales team at Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin to the minute I stepped into my Uber to head to the airport when our meeting was completed, EVERYTHING (and i mean everything!!) was handled beautifully by the professional team on staff there. Our professional association hosted about 50 individuals with four separate meals occurring on site and our full-day meeting there as well. The rooms -- our ""run-of-house"" to our VIP suites -- were lovely and the housekeeping staff fabulous! The food was unique, diverse,and YUMMY!!! The meeting team -- catering (managers/servers/bartenders), sales, A/V -- were SUPERB! Jennifer, Ghina, Heaven, Javier, Nate, Joseph, Veronica, Martha -- THANK YOU!!! Wouldn't change a thing!! Wish I could host every one of our meetings with y'all!!"
3,"Nice hotel, too historic!","As the hotel is very old, the hotel rooms are very small. I don't know if the people that are high up in the elite program have nicer rooms, but mine was the size of a Microtel hotel room. Though it was small, the hotel room was very nicely appointed."
1,Do Not Stay Here,"I had a late check in Friday night for a 4 night stay. First vacation in a long time. Based on reviews I read I booked the King Continental so my husband and I could have a larger room and access to breakfast and cocktail hour if we wanted. We checked in about 10:30 pm after a long day of travel. At check in nothing was mentioned about access to the breakfast or cocktail hour. I figured I could address it the next morning, it was such a long day already. So we got to our room and it was a queen, not a king bed. So I called the front desk to ask why we were in the wrong room. I was told they ran out of rooms and basically I was out of luck. But they could put me in a small king room the following day. I also asked why I wasn’t told about the breakfast and cocktail hour. He stated he was “just seeing that on my account now“. Was he trying to pull one over on me? So now we have been moved to a tiny king room with no reduction in price. This place is a joke. Also if you own a cell phone or have the need to recharge any device you can’t do it in this hotel. There are Zero available outlets. Do not stay here. They’re dishonest and unfair."
1,Overrated - overpriced - the intercontinental doesn’t have a continental breakfast; go figure.,I had to wait 2 hours to enter my tiny $300 room. The only surviving feature is the location but I’m sure you can get more bang for your buck across the street. If you’re going to Austin - look elsewhere.
5,Servvie,This hotel is awesome. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. Hospitality was above a 10. Carmen Ortiz (director) greeted us and made us feel at home. Vincent that worked the front desk also made us feel so welcomed and answered all our questions We went to the 2nd floor lounge for a night cap. The bartender Hope was so welcoming and made sure we had a nice time.
5,Very Accommodating Hotel!,"We had a great stay - We stayed last weekend for our anniversary. The accommodations were great, room was clean, bed was comfortable. Location was perfect.Even better, is that we unexpectedly got a bottle of Rose & Chocolates sent to our room with a handwritten note from the hotel manager. The personal touch goes a long way and we really appreciated it. The hotel was also very accommodating and sent a mini-fridge up to our room so that my wife could store her breast milk that she was pumping so that it wouldn't go to waste. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
5,Great Staff and Great Location!,"Couldn't ask for anything more! From the doorman to the banquet staff, this property delivers! Their professionalism, enthusiasm and hospitality are second to none! If something popped up during the meeting...no problem...they were happy to help."
5,"Great Location, Friendly Staff",Location is great for business or leisure. Friendly and helpful staff. I’ve hosted large meetings here and stayed for personal trips—service Is always exceptional. SF Bar is great for late night gatherings
5,Great location for corporate meetings...lots fun places/dinning options within walking distance!,"I was visiting Austin with a group of 40 for a business meeting. From the moment we arrived, we experienced the unique hospitality that you tend to expect from a luxury hotel. This gorgeous, historical hotel is in the heart of downtown Austin, next to the famous Paramount Theater. Only one block from 6th Street (fun nightlife area) and four blocks from the State Capital (beautiful buildings, monuments, and gardens). Our group enjoyed nothing but the best with the true southern hospitality. Everything was a first-class service. We had a three days business conference at the hotel. We enjoyed all the delicious breakfasts and lunches. The spacious meeting space had natural light, lots of windows, and access to the terrace/balcony. We had our lunches at the terrace while enjoy the gorgeous weather, people-watching, and the magnificent views of the State Capitol. The entire staff were super professional, helpful, friendly, and demonstrated exceptional attention to detail. For business meetings, it’s all about service and location, and the InterContinental, exceeded our expectations. Overall, the service was impressive. The hotel is within walking distance of historical and trendy areas, with lots of dining options available. The sales and catering teams made everything super easy and accommodated all our needs. The team loved the hotel! The staff was amazing, and rooms were beautiful. It was really a great value for the quality of the hotel and the location. Everyone loved the food and the meeting space. We would love to go back to the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin!"
5,Great location & amazing bar selections!,"I am a local Austinite and recently had the pleasure of staying at this historic and iconic hotel due to a work event. I have always loved the amazing bar which is on the second floor and has an amazing wrap-around patio overlooking Congress Ave. The hotel is, in my opinion, the nicest hotel w/in walking distance of the Capitol and so much more! The room was gorgeous and the service was excellent. I look forward to coming up with another excuse to stay in this local gem of a hotel!"
4,Last night of a 2 week holiday,"Stayed for one night after being elsewhere in the USA.Pleasant friendly staff, lovely outside balcony area to sit and have a beer- prices also very reasonable on the alcohol- we didn’t eat here.Room was of a high standard although small as was the bathroom. But bonus for us- good checking out time - noon. Hotel also happy to store suitcases whilst checked out.Only observation that would of improved things for us would have been maids cleaning other rooms being considerate of time in the morning when others trying to sleep - also having a door person on the front would of been handy rather than struggling with suitcase etc.However all in all a nice way to end our break."
5,The best hotel in the city,"Good location, nice rooms with very comfortable beds and fairly sized bathrooms.The Spa area (pool) was a bit tired so some extra maintenance would really make a difference... despite was happy to use the facilities.Breakfast was just perfect."
5,First Time in Austin,We've now stayed at 10 Intercon propertoies. Intercontinental Austin offers the same great amenities and service that we have come to expect. Highly recommend and would definitely return. The outdoor terrace was probably our favorite part along with the room
5,Amazing hotel,"Very good service, exceptional breakfast service, very close to University and other good points, I just highly recommended this hotel. Amazing decoration, comfortable rooms, good pillows. Everything is a first class service"
5,Great Hotel in the centre of the city close to the Capitol Building,Lovely hotel with great service. Recommend booking a Club room. Nice club lounge with great breakfast and excellent range of evening canapés. The service is excellent as you would expect with this hotel chain. Valet parking available.
1,Disappointing hotel,"My wife and I just returned from an one night stay at the Intercontinental. The hotel is expensive but our experience and totally not worth it.We checked in at 12:30 am after arriving from Seattle. We were only staying one day and the check-out time was 11:00 am. At 9:00 am, we had a knock on our door to clean our room. Well, since we were sleeping, we told them to come back. However if we were not sleeping, why in the world would a hotel clean your room at 9:00 am with check-out at 11:00 am? They would have to do it again after we left.That did not end our interruptions to our stay at the hotel. Fifteen minutes later, we got another knock on the door from the person filling the mini-bar. Again, why would they not wait until check-out.Our sleep was destroyed as 9:00 am Austin time is only 7:00 am Seattle. Thus, trying to get a full night’s sleep at the hotel was impossible. And it cost us $300 for this pleasure.To top it off, when I could not get the Wi-Fi to work. I went to the front desk and they showed me how to get it but I would have to pay $12.99. I thought that they were kidding. There is no hotel in the world now that charges for Wi Fi. I travel all of the time, including internationally, and never, and I repeat never, get charged for Wi Fi. They told me that I could become a member of their program to waive the charges. Since I think that Intercontinental is the worse chain of nice hotels that I have ever stayed at, there is no way that I wanted to become a member. The Wi Fi charges were the icing on the cake. The hotel is trying to gouge its customers. Wi-Fi is like water these days – essential and part of any infrastructure of any hotel. It is like charging money to use the water in a hotel – a total rip-off.I have to say one nice word, though. I had the pleasure of meeting Carmen Furet, Rooms Directory, and told her about our complaints. She gave us a free breakfast which was so nice of her. And she was an incredible nice person and without her, this hotel would be a total disaster. She is a gem of a person.In summary, stay at a different hotel. This hotel is expensive and considering their attitudes towards their guests, including trying to totally rip them off by charging forWi Fi, you would be much better off staying at the many fine hotels in Austin, most probably much cheaper."
5,Wonderful accommodating hotel,"The Stephen F Austin Hotel was so accommodating. My husband had just had shoulder surgery and could only sleep in a recliner. The management, Eric I believe, rented a recliner and had it brought to our room. The hotel bar was super cool and the restaurant was absolutely fabulous. The rooms were spacious and lovely. We will definitely be returning."
5,"Great hotel, impressive service!","I will definitely return again! Very comfortable hotel, great location and personable staff...I will highly recommend this hotel to all of my friends, family and colleagues. Roaring Forks is nearly in the lobby, other excellent restaurants are easily within walking distance and step outside the side entry and look up the street on our beautiful pink granite Texas State Capitol!"
5,Valentines Trip,"This place was fabulous. Our deluxe king room was spacious and provided all the amenities expected of a top notch hotel. The bar and grill on second floor offer great view of capitol and People watching. The staff was friendly and I highly suggest paying for the club experience-excellent breakfast, drinks, and snacks for free during the stay."
5,Amazing Service,What an amazing hotel in a wonderful location. Vinnie who is the catering manager helped us out so much with a last minute group function in the hotel's bar. He came in at 6:30am to be there before we would arrive at the bar. He never stopeed moving ...he was constantly back and forth seeing if we needed anything. His enthusiasm was contageous and if you talked to him you felt happy. You can tell from about 30 seconds of speaking with him that he loves his job and that he is fantastic at it. If only I could clone him and put one of him at every hotel I stay at. Vinnie...thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. You were an angel to us this past weekend.
5,Austin Trip,"This hotel was excellent! Great staff and service. The room was so great. Great location downtown Austin, close to entertainment and restaurants! Easy parking options although use valet....so easy. Very updated but still has great older features. Roaring Fork is awesome and right inside! The only thing is I wished the bar stayed open later. Was there during the week and went to a concert and came back and it was closed."
4,Great stay downtown Austin!,A nice weekend taking in the music of Austin. Booked a Priceline room for a great rate and lived the hotel and the rooms. Be aware that they do not have self parking options for downtown hotels so expect about $46 valet parking a night. Beautiful upscale hotel though and would go back.
5,Rustic yet elegant,"Beautiful lobby and majestic staircase leading up, complete with a generous library if you forgot to bring your own book. I was there on business with lots of other people checking in and out at the same time, and everyone was so helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable, amenities were nice, valet and bell service was quick, even with many people waiting. The restaurant fare was above normal hotel restaurant expectations, even if a little pricey. The trickest part of the stay was feeling like I was blocking traffic in front of the hotel, but that was due to many people arriving at once."
3,A grande dame that needs to seriously up its game,"The Stephen F. is one of Austin's two grande dame hotels, the other being the Driskill a block south. It first opened in the Roaring '20s era and was Austin's first ""high-rise."" It features a jaw-dropper of an entrance and lobby, and a second-floor bar with one of Austin's best patios for people-watching along Congress Avenue, with the Texas Capitol visible just up the street.I've both personally stayed at the property -- and had myriad family and friends stay there as well -- more times than I can count. And until barely a decade ago, its only real competition aside from the Driskill was the significantly more upscale (and pricey) Four Seasons. That was then. Now downtown Austin has a half-dozen newer 4- and 4.5-star hotels competing for business, all priced in a similar range as the Stephen F. One would think InterContinental, which has managed the property for quite a while now, would take notice of the competitive threat and up the hotel's game all around. If so, one would be sorely mistaken: based on a recent stay, the Stephen F. has actually gone down a notch.One of the ""quirks"" of staying in a nearly 100-year-old building is it having a wide variety of room sizes within the same basic category. Somewhat surprisingly, the room photos from TripAdvisor's Oyster.com affiliate show a sizable king room in a corner setting with a half-dozen windows and great light. Considering Oyster's mission of unmasking ""hotel fake-out photos,"" I'm rather stunned that they failed to shoot any pics of rooms like the one I had on my most recent stay. It was the smallest guest room I've ever seen at the place: only barely large enough to fit a king-size bed, with a bathroom that was 6'x8' at most. Moreover, it was on the third floor (the lowest one with guest rooms) and featured a not-so-lovely view of HVAC equipment on an adjacent building's roof. (And it only had the one window, not six.)When I used to travel a lot for work I'd joke with my friends about getting the dreaded ""Priceline room,"" the nickname we gave to the rooms certain hotels that shall remain nameless gave to their ""cheapskate"" guests who booked through a discount site. That was back in the days when Priceline still emphasized its Name Your Own Price service, which it no longer promotes. Nonetheless, I admittedly booked my room through Hotwire (essentially the same), but this was the first time in many years that I've actually gotten the dreaded ""Priceline room"" despite a) mentioning that I was aware of the differing room sizes and specifically requesting a larger room in the same category and b) the hotel clearly not being anywhere close to full, since it's the off-season plus downtown Austin has added 3,000+ rooms (in the four-star category) in the past five years alone. After asking I was total they could accommodate my request -- for a $50 upcharge. And while I wouldn't describe the front desk clerk as ""rude,"" he definitely seemed standoffish.Most disconcerting, however, was the fact that Austin was experiencing an unusual issue with its municipal water supply: somehow zebra mussels got into the system. If you've never smelled water in such a condition, consider yourself lucky: it's roughly akin to a diluted version of Louisiana swamp water. Despite purportedly being safe to drink, you have to hold your nose while doing so. And despite the hotel having a notice at the front desk about the ongoing water problem, it DIDN'T EVEN OFFER COMPLIMENTARY DRINKING WATER under the circumstances. THAT is simply not acceptable, and I almost gave the hotel two stars because of it. Still, I decided based on sentimental value to at least keep it at three stars.OTOH the difference between it and the Hotel Van Zandt -- both owned by the same holding company, IHG -- is night & day. The Van Zandt is admittedly a Kimpton property, long one of the best in the business, and caters to a younger crowd. Still, it pretty much runs circles around the Stephen F. given that it sweats the details -- and it's in the details where the Stephen F. falls short even when the water is normal. Its room decor hasn't been updated in at least four or five years, except for possibly some relatively new flatscreen TVs and RFID room keys (the ones you just wave over a lock to open it), and is looking decidedly dated, with rooms a seeming sea of beige. (Even the massive convention center Hilton a few blocks away -- which has around 1,000 rooms -- has a much more modern feel, never mind the likes of the Westin and Fairmont.) Its sound insulation -- which has always been a problem -- remains terrible, and one can readily hear conversations in adjacent rooms (albeit muffled ones) and the hallway (not-so-muffled). Finally, I have yet to meet a Kimpton employee who wasn't both cheerful and altogether accommodating.While I realize it's a historic building, I also know how hotels of similar vintage in other cities that have retrofitted them with modern soundproofing. Upon check-in I encountered a new, and decidedly guest-unfriendly, requirement: agreeing to pay a $75 fee if you stay past the standard noon checkout time. This was the first time I've ever seen such a thing at a four-star boutique-style chain hotel. (It's SOP at many, if not most, four-star properties to allow guests to stay an extra hour if they don't have a full house the day of departure.)To be fair, the hotel has quite a few positive points aside from its lobby. The beds are great, as are their pillows (an area many similarly priced properties can't seem to get right). Rooms have ample ports for both electrical plugs and USB outlets, along with Keurig coffeemakers.And despite the decor being the same as I remember it from five years ago, none of it looked dated, so I assume at least the carpets and drapes have been updated.But still: it's no longer a place I recommend to friends, family and work associates visiting Austin, or even in the top three. The similarly priced Van Zandt, JW Marriott and Fairmont frankly put the Stephen F. to shame in nearly every way short of location. (The JW is also on Congress, five blocks south, but the Fairmont sits next to the interstate in a spot near nothing but the convention center and the Rainey St. district - and the Van Zandt is similarly situated, albeit not as close to the freeway.)I think it would behoove IHG to follow the lead of its Kimpton division and give the Stephen F. a thorough revamp in terms of both design & room quality/size.As it stands right now, this grande dame has fallen into also-ran territory."
4,Compressed luxury,"The rooms vary in size, and we got one that felt a bit cramped.It was nicely appointed and the bathroom was roomy and comfortable.The staff was attentive and helpful, but if they charge much more for parking I am going to rent my car a cheap motel room nearby and Uber in and out.I was surprise that even with the relative sparsity of elevators, the wait time was always short.The business center is free for guests, and came in useful a few times.The bar can get crowded in the early evening and closes around 11 most nights, making it a bit tame for a major hotel.I didn't look at the minibar once I saw it was a ""move it you buy it"" and there was not enough room in the fridge for our bottle of wine.Ice machines are on every floor."
5,Returned list item - great service!,"I left my Apple Watch and charger in my room after I checked out. V pleasant and reliable retrieving it and returning it to me, which is much appreciated.Good location, and v helpful porters with luggage and helping to find transportation."
5,Historic Hotel on Congress Ave,The location is excellent for experiencing downtown Austin! From start to finish our stay was great. The king room with sitting area gives plenty of room to move around. I especially appreciated friendly room service at 2:00 a.m.
4,Lovely hotel but missing critical element in the room,"I had a lovely stay at the Intercontinental. The service was great from the start and the room was mostly adequate. My only question, and the reason I docked a star, is why do the beds not have a top sheet? I'm finding more and more that hotels are foregoing a top sheet in favor of simply a duvet cover. I am skeptical from a hygiene perspective that the duvet covers get a wash every time."
4,Great location and staff,"The location can't be beat and the room was excellent. We stayed with our daughter and the king + fold out couch was perfect. My one complaint is the beds were pretty hard. We stayed for 3 nights and we had a great time. The hot tub and swimming pool were never crowded, we loved our stay."
5,Amazing hotel/staff,We booked a block of ten rooms for the beginning of the Texas Legislative session. David Kaso was our contact. He made everything super easy and accommodated guests that wanted to book extra days outside our block. Our guests loved the hotel! Staff was amazing and rooms were beautiful. It was really a great value for the quality of the hotel and the locations. Everyone loved the beds!
5,Fun times!,"I visited Austin before a trade show in San Antonio. They give me a suite. Love it. As always, I check the bathrobe and the slipppers. Their swimming pool is narrow but I enjoyed it. They also have a hot tub. The concierge are very helpful when I was planning my trip and during my trip. I had a nice view of the city. I went out to take pictures of the capitol at night. Very convenient location. I did a lot of walking."
5,Service/ Comfort/ Classic,"At first glance, the hotel gives off a charming vibe. When you enter the gilded doors, there is a grand staircase typical of classy places from another era. Our room was well kept and we had a wonderful view facing Congress. I ended up leaving something behind and the hotel was soled and amicable about mailing it to be quickly. We would stay here again."
5,Event on NYE 2018,"Fantastic event held here on NYE 2018. We had planned for close to a year, working with Julie S. Everything about the party was done with professionalism and exceptional attention to detail. Our guests booked both suites and had some regular room types, all were very nice and reasonably priced given the holiday date.We had researched a number of venues for this in Austin, so glad we chose the Stephen F. Austin."
5,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff",Love the old historic hotels with modern amenities. This one doesn't disappoint! Every staff member we interacted with was helpful and friendly. Our room was spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel if you are in Austin.
1,"Security Bully ""Frank""","For nearly 3 years I have faithfully stayed 5-10 days a month at this otherwise WONDERFUL hotel. Manuel at the front desk, Veronica in the club restaurant, and Samantha in the Bar (until she recently quit) are fantastic ambassadors for the property and generally all of the staff there are excellent and remain my favorite people. To a large degree the staff at this hotel is why I have returned month after month week after week even though I have many options for newer or more modern hotels when staying in Austin on business. Sadly, that all came to a screeching halt this week after my encounter with ""Frank"" the security guy on the night shift. For context, this hotel features a wonderful ""L"" shaped second level outdoor deck fronting both Congress Ave. and 7th street that allows guests to be outside and enjoy a drink, a smoke or Cigar which the bar sells as an amenity to its guests. Last Monday evening after returning from a business dinner I grabbed a bottle of water and went downstairs to sit on the deck and enjoy a cigar. The bar was just closing so they were no longer serving alcohol on ""bar"" portion of the outdoor deck. There is no separation or formal signage of any kind stating a delineation between the ""bar"" deck and the so called ""public"" deck that fronts 7th street. When I walked outside to sit on the deck there were 15-20 guests sitting on the ""public"" side of the deck. Purely out of consideration for these guests I moved about 20 feet into the bar portion of the deck so that my cigar smoke would not bother any of these guests. Sitting among these people with a lit cigar would be about as polite as letting a flatus go in a crowded elevator (no humor intended). Over the last nearly 3 years of staying here I have sat on the ""bar"" deck overlooking Congress Ave. many many times after hours enjoying a cigar and catching up on email or playing solitaire on my iPad and never have I been approached by anyone, especially anyone telling me it was against ""hotel policy"" to be on that portion of the deck after hours. Quite the contrary, I have patronized the bar on the second level and been advised that it was ""OK"" to be there after the bar closed by my servers, I just couldn't have an alcoholic beverage there after hours which was totally fine with me hence me grabbing a bottle of water on this evening. I was minding my own business and smoking my cigar for about 5 minutes when ""Frank"" appears behind me and says ""This part of the deck is closed and you have to move on buddy""... I looked up and said OK, but I'm only sitting here because I was trying to be courteous and mindful of your other guests who may not enjoy me sitting in the middle of their fun with a cigar. To that he replies ""It doesn't matter, you need to move"" I looked at him and said I've been coming here for 3 years now and sat here many times, are you ""ordering"" me to leave"" He says ""No, I'm telling you to move on, it's against hotel policy"" Point being, it was a total power trip with the insinuation he would shortly be calling the police or physically remove me. All of this could have been handled in a much more polite and rational manner such as saying something to the effect of ""soon as those folks clear out please move to the tables over there"" but he chose to be rude and very aggressive in his approach. This offended me because I was not trying to be a rule breaker or a rebel without a cause.... I was only trying to be courteous to the other guests and a move of 20 feet was irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Suffice it to say it completely soured my entire stay. I went downstairs and spoke with the desk manager (I didn't get his name) but all he would say is ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" I'm not looking for an apology or to be on the right side of a disagreement, I have never written anything ever but positive reviews about places I have stayed (see my previous review of Stephen F. Austin Intercontinental) because flaming a place I didn't like is not something I would waste my time on. In this case, I felt it should at least be brought to the attention of senior management. I am not delusional and do not believe that my monthly business will move the needle of their bottom line, but for this experience I will no longer book at this hotel and it makes me sad because I felt like the Intercontinental was my Austin home away from home."
5,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Location",The Intercontinental always has amazing properties and hotels. This stay was no exception. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were super soft and spacious. The location is central to the capital. The employees were extremely hospitable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
1,Worst ever InterContinental I have stayed,"I have stayed at few dozens of IC in the past few years for business travel and family trip, and I have to say this is the worst ever I have seen.1. There is no guest parking and valet only, and you have to pay ~45 per day.2. The room is tiny. We had 2 suitcases and there is barely space for us to open both. There is desk next to bed, but if you sit in front of the desk on the chair, there is no space to get to one side of the bed.3. Bed is small, like double size and only one bed.4. The room is very old, like not renovated for one or two decades.5. The toilet flush is very very noisy, like a broken toilet.I think one thing I like is the location, which is close to anywhere in downtown. But since it’s a small downtown in Austin, any hotel in downtown should have such advantage."
5,Best hotel in Austin,The SFA offers beautiful clean rooms and the greatest hotel bar in the city. We stayed here for my wedding weekend and were told by many of our wedding guests that the hotel staff went above and beyond to offer restaurant recommendations etc. They made our stay for the wedding weekend perfect and we are so grateful for that! It was also decorated beautifully for Christmas which made it feel extra special.
5,Can't beat the location!,"We needed an overnight stay in downtown Austin after company Christmas Party, so we picked this hotel due to proximity and the history of the hotel. It's right across the street from the historic Driskill and the new Aloft hotel.Honestly we weren't in the hotel much other than checking in and sleep, so I can't comment much on the service. However, the location of the hotel is obviously top notch, the hotel itself was beautiful, and clean and elegant. The bathroom was decent size (loved the makeup/desk area in the bathroom). Bed was comfortable as well.Obviously the number 1 complaint from most of the previous reviews was the cost of the valet parking. We ended up parking at the Capitol Visitor Garage for $12 (10-minute or 1200 steps walk) so it worked out okay for us.Would recommend this place and would stay here again."
5,Wonderful service.,"We stayed in the “Stephen F” for a week over Christmas on vacation and could not have been happier. The front desk staff, especially Manuel, went the extra mile to ensure we had absolutely everything we needed. The room was huge and the king size bed extremely comfortable. We stayed in a club room and the breakfast and evening hot snacks were delicious and plentiful. In the breakfast room Veronica was a treasure, she looked after us and our 1-year-old extremely well and nothing was too much trouble.The location is as central as it gets - we were a five minute walk from the Texas State Capitol and surrounded by restaurants and stores of every kind. The famous Allen’s Boots is a 15 minute stroll down Congress and over the river if you want to get your Cowboy on."
5,Excellent!,"Staying at the Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin was incredible!This was my first trip to Austin and I could not have asked for a better hotel experience. From the moment I arrived I was treated fantastic! Everyone went out of their way to make me feel welcome and my room was perfect. Every time I left or arrived back to the hotel, I was greeted by my name. The concierge (I’m so sorry I forgot his name) was so amazing and gave me great suggestions! I am just sorry that I was only able to spend 3 nights."
5,"Outstanding service, fixed Expedia screwup","Started out inauspiciously when it turns out Expedia screwed up our reservation...Exp. had charged us, but never booked it with the hotel.But hotel staff was fabulous - fortunately had a room, and made it right for us, even giving us a slightly better rate than Expedia, (which has now moved to our do-not-use list).Throughout, the staff was first rate, the room was excellent. Only blip was a bad bartender on Sunday night in 2nd floor bar. Ignored our order for way too long and didn't seem to care about that.But overall, absolutely excellent. Highly recommended."
5,Best service recovery and helpfull valet,"We travel here as a family and I book 2 rooms for a night. First of all, the location is amazing right in the corner of 7th street and congress avenue (1 street away from 6th street, Austin's bar area). Secondly the valet parking is team of the best team I met in the hotel (very helpful and nice). And thirdly, the reception works very well on recovering the failure during our stay and thumbs up for the whole team. There are a slight issue that they about to charge me for the mineral water which I dont drink, but then they remove it fast from the bill. Apparently they have censors so when it moved it considered been taken (maybe I accidently move it when I want to make coffee).During our stay, the AC and TV in my room which I book for my elderly aunt and uncle is broken down and they need to send technician to fix it. In the end they still unable to figure it out so they give complimentary breakfast for my aunt and uncle which makes them happy. The lobby is beautiful and the outside patios is very comfortable, although it is a little cold when we were there. Lastly we have a chance to try the restaurant 'Roaring Fork', the food is out of this world and the portion is very generous. Lastly, I went to the gym in the morning, and they provide quite range of equipment with indoor pool, so very comfortable.Despite of the great experiences and adquate room, the size of the room is a little small compare to other so it feels like a little cramped. The bathroom is small and for me (173cm and 135kg) is easily to make a puddle on the floor from the water splash from the shower. Breakfast is a little pricy which is a little disappointing compare to the type and quality of the food provided. Overall, I highly recommended this hotel and the main reason is the staff is very nice and helpful, Thanks."
4,What you would expect and a bit more,"Excellent check-in experience, which resulted in a beer being offered! The hotel is just what you would expect from this kind of hotel: well appointed rooms, and good facilities. But the secret here is the excellent location - right on the main drag and a short stagger to 6th street."
5,Excellent hotel and service for a celebration!,"We reserved a block of rooms for our son's wedding. To a person, each staff member, from the Concierge to Housekeeping to Valet to Catering Manager and restaurant servers, was professional, delightful and extremely helpful.The hotel is lovely and welcoming, and the rooms are nicely decorated, in excellent shape, very comfortable and very clean. It is located centrally to everything and taxis & ride services are easily available.We arranged for a brunch for 130 people on Sunday morning and I had a great experience planning the event with the Director of Catering. The set-up was impeccable, the wait-staff was meticulous and the food was excellent.We stayed for a week preparing for our weekend celebration and we couldn't have had a better experience! From the top down this is an extremely well-run hotel and it seems as if every staff member is working collaboratively to make sure guests have an excellent experience."
5,Wonderful for wedding guests,"Wonderful service and accommodations for our many wedding guests. From the moment we first reserved the room block through our daughter’s wedding weekend, the service was terrific. We particularly appreciated Chenisse for helping us keep track of who had made reservations and Julie who helped us book the State Room for primping prior to the wedding. The valets were also gracious and prompt fetching our cars. Lovely experience all around."
5,Amazing Hotel in Austin,"This hotel is so classy and elegant. The rooms are very clean and very well maintained. I love the red doors of each guest rooms. The club lounge in the first floor is located in a very convenient and practical place in the lobby. I love the second floor bar and the new hidden bar The Whisper. The wrap around terrace is absolutely amazing with the view of the capitol and also the high rise building. This hotel it's in a perfect location in downtown Austin, The service it's amazing as well. Staffs are very friendly and very attentive to the guests. I really love the this hotel and so far it's my favorite in Austin!"
5,The best hotel in Austin with the BEST service and staff!,"If you are planning to stay in Austin, I highly recommend this hotel! For leisure or business, the hotel is perfectly central to all the best restaurants and sights. The hotel is always immaculate, the staff is so friendly and helpful, and the hotel bar and restaurant inside (Roaring Fork) are great!"
5,Great Hotel!!,"What a Great Hotel!!! Great Location, Beautiful Rooms, Amazing Staff - everything during our stay was perfect!! We were there for a wedding and was so impressed with every aspect of our stay. Highly recommend this hotel!!"
5,"Amazing hotel, and even better staff!",First time visit and wow. Seriously wow. From first impression with the valet parking and staff at the entrance to seamless check-in. Mega thanks to Dorrie in Sales - a true hospitality professional. Experienced great food and service in the Roaring Fork restaurant. All the way around-great service and great hotel.
5,CAM-I meeting,"Very professional staff, good support on Audio Visual, Food conference rooms, billing.Nice and clean rooms, one of the best for customer service.Will book it again.Willingness to work on our requirements on quality and price"
5,Great Place,"Clean Room, good bed, great bathroom, nice amenities, great location, good food, great staff but the one thing that separates this hotel from others is its selection of TV channels! It furnished ""Premium TV Channels for ""free"", such as HBO, Starz, Encore, and Cinemax. Not all of us want to go out and drink and dance all night. A lot of us like to stay in, relax and watch TV after a long day. Well this is the place to do this! I would stay here again!"
5,Great experience! Top notch service!,"Most friendly and helpful staff ever, so lovely and great facility! My wife and I went to the historical Intercontinental in Austin to celebrate our 5th year anniversary. Before our arrival I contacted the staff and asked to help me make it special!They went above and beyond! The front desk staff were just so friendly and welcoming when we arrived! We got to the hotel just before check in time, and they allowed us to check in early.The best part! The staff brought us a champagne bottle with chocolates to our room with a welcome note from the general manager.I highly recommend this hotel for leisure or business. Our room was comfortable and super clean! Intercontinental hotels really know how to make your stay special.I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future!"
5,Home Away From Home,"Love the IH staff. They take the extra time and have attention to detail to make you feel special during your stay. You can enjoy the great food.Especially if you take advantage of the Club Experience. Munchies, drinks etc., all during the day and night. Easy walking to everything Austin has to offer."
5,Immaculate,"When I was shopping around for a hotel for a weekend getaway to Austin, and wanting something close to the university since we would be attending a football game, I saw this hotel that had great reviews and some nice old TX history attached to it, which I dearly appreciate and even though it wasn’t budget friendly, I booked it and very glad that I did!! We had not stayed at a hotel in the IHG group until this trip. We arrived around 5:30 p m on a Friday and it wasn’t overly busy. We did the expensive valet parking and all of the guys were polite and friendly. Didn’t wait long at all at check in desk. Our room was on the 16th, the top floor, and at first I thought oh no, right by the elevator, it’s going to be noisy, but I was very wrong. The whole two night stay was nice and quiet! I had signed up for the club Intercontinental, so after dropping off our luggage in our huge, extremely clean room, we went back down for the complimentary drinks and snacks. We met Vinny, the director of food and beverage and enjoyed visiting with him as we are both Italian and talked about Italy! The snacks were plentiful and very good, especially the mozzarella & tomatoes balls in basil pesto. I can’t remember the waiter’s name but he was from another country on a work type program and he was very nice and friendly and we wish him well on his next adventure. The breakfast buffet was very good and filling. And it was changed up some what each morning.We would definitely stay here again if the chance came up.Everything and everyone was great!"
5,Great staff,"We stayed 3 nights and the front desk person was such a nice gentleman, very professional and courteous. Excellent location, walking distance to everywhere. Clean and very comfortable beds. Very professional porters at front door. The restaurant food was excellent for dinner, they accommodate our vegan preference. Upon check out we had the same gentleman at the front desk (Manuel) and again very courteous and professional. That type of person at the front desk makes all the difference, it’s your first and last impression of the hotel."
4,God location,"The location of the Intercontinental Stephen Austin is in the middle of everything in downtown Austin, walking distance to the State Capitol, UT campus, most restaurants and of course 6th Street which is the nighttime mecca of bars and music venues. The hotel is about what one would expect from and Intercontinental. The room was spacious and comfortable, service was good, check in easy. However, if you are looking for an ""experience"" or local flavor, you won't get it here. This could an Intercontinental anywhere."
5,Fab place for VVIP Corporate events,"Our organization, TLTA, worked with Jennifer Schlabach and Julie Stanfield to plan a corporate reception and dinner for our VIPS. They took excellent care of us and ensured our folks had a memorable evening. Jennifer and Julie made planning this event an absolute dream. The Stephen F. has a fabulous team that performs at the highest level. If you are planning a special occasion to wow your clients, you should book the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin!"
5,Recent trip to Austin for Medical Procedure,"My wife and I have stayed at the Stephen F. Austin three times in the past year. I've been going through medical procedures at St. David's Medical Center. We have a few more trips to Austin planned, and there is no place we would rather stay than at this hotel. It is a classic hotel located just a few blocks from the state capital building, right in the heart of downtown Austin. This most recent stay was a bit challenging as we needed a five night reservation...although one of those nights, I was to be in the hospital. So guess what? The hotel had a room for the first two night, were booked for the third (Formula 1 was in town) and then had a room the next two nights. So, they made two reservations for us and accommodated us in such a kind way, it felt like we were getting VIP treatment. John and Vincent were extremely helpful. My wife made a few calls to try to work out the details. It worked! We stayed the first two nights. Spent the third night in the hospital. Then, we checked in again for the next two nights. All of the staff...from the valet guys, to the front desk people - Manuel in particular - to the restaurant staff - we love Veronica - ALL of them were extremely helpful. We could not have asked for a better stay. The service we were offered, in addition to the accommodations, was first class, all the way. By the way, the room was so comfortable, clean, and exactly what I needed to recover from surgery. This hotel has a compassionate and helpful staff. Plus, having The Roaring Fork Restaurant on the premises is also a big asset. We ate there five times, including one night of take-out. We love the chicken tortilla soup, but everything we've had there is good. We are planning to return in December, and there is no other hotel choice for us in Austin! A+ grade on everything!"
5,Great Hotel,"Located downtown, there are plenty of restaurants and attractions to walk to. The second floor bar was a great place to sit outside, enjoy some food and drink, while watching the people on the street."
4,"Great location, nice hotel","I visited Austin for a weekend family getaway in mid-October. I called the day before our arrival to confirm the reservation and inform the hotel we would be arriving between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m. Check in time is 3:00 p.m. We arrived at 3:45 p.m. and were told our suite was not ready and that we would have to wait an hour. You can imagine my irritation, especially since I called ahead. As a consolation, the front desk offered us free access to their lounge for our entire stay. We enjoyed a drink while we waited and our room was available within the hour. The room itself was spacious, well appointed and very clean. We were on the 11th floor in a corner suite with an awesome view of the Capital. The sofa bed and king bed in the room were very comfortable. The valet service was professional and very speedy. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to so many restaurants and attractions. Despite the rocky start, we had a great stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again."
2,Incompetent front desk and rude manager,"The room quality is fantastic, and the two bars were great as well. The breakfast quality is ok and service was slow due to kitchen getting backed up. I made a reservation for 8 rooms, and there are 8 people in my party. One room for each person. After returning home, I logged into my IHG account and there is a extra person charge of $240 for every room. I called the property, the front desk was unable to resolve the issue as the person was getting interrupted by incoming calls, He dropped my call once, finally transferred to the manager, one Ms. Payal, she was unhelpful and I have to start explaining from the beginning, like you are calling the cable company. Called the corporate and filed a compliant, as of now the issue is unresolved, they promised to get back in 48 hrs. Major letdown by Intercontinental, should have gone with JW."
3,Nice hotel. Friendly staff.,"We had an enjoyable visit. The front desk and door staff were very friendly. Bathroom could use more sink counter space, they provide a small table that makes the room very awkward. We were woken up by a garbage truck emptying dumpsters the first night. We didn’t know if it was from street level or the parking ramp right outside our window. Overall, it’s a pretty basic hotel."
1,Really loud,Incredibly noisy bar right across the street from the hotel. Loud music from their external speakers until midnight. Front desk said they’d called the bar but it made no difference. Avoid this hotel if you want to sleep.
5,Amazing staff and great location,One of the things that make this hotel so amazing is the staff. They really care about making you stay amazing. Front desk staff that checked me in ( Eric and the front desk supervisor lady ) were very kind and took the time to explain the hotel and things to do in Austin. Really showed that they loved their job and wanted to make each checking personalized to each customer. Also the location of the hotel is great and the club lounge is nice and quite. Keep up the great job.
5,Nice Hotel & Location,"I booked with this hotel for a bachelorette night and I was not disappointed. I was pleased with the options I was given with the number of ladies staying the night, and I went with a King Deluxe room. The service and staff were very helpful. The hotel is in a hot spot in Austin. A block away from 6th street and right in the middle of everything, perfect for walking. The ladies enjoyed their stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
2,Indifferent unprofessional staff - A hotel that doesn't understand the meaning of quality,Great location and walking distance to some great Austin attractions. The staff at check in and general front desk staff were the worst trained staff I have ever encountered at an Intercontinental hotel. I was literally lied to by check in staff about the room I was being given. Apart from some stale fruit None of the benefits of being a Spire Ambassador member of IHG were delivered. Its indeed sorry to see the up-sell penny pinching culture being so apparent at brand like Intercontinental. Booked for two nights and checked out after one. Moved to another hotel at 60% of the price of this one with far superior service. The lady at the Ambassador desk was helpful and professional otherwise what could be a decent Intercontinental ruined by poorly trained and unprofessional staff who don't understand the meaning of delivering quality the Intercontinental way.
5,We Were Treated Extremely Well by the Staff,"From the moment we drove up, we were treated extremely well by all of the staff. Throughout our stay, we were very impressed by their friendly and helpful service. In particular, the gentleman at the front desk seemed to make every effort to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We stayed in a king-size room with a pull-out sofa-bed. The many quality features of our room included a comfy bed, bedside tables with extra outlets, well made solid furniture, a roomy sitting area, a sizable lighted closet with robes and a safe, and a large TV with many movie channels. The tiled bathroom was nicely appointed with many towels, pleasantly scented lemon products and a separate seated vanity/make-up area. (Photos attached.) Our only nit-pick is their $42.00 a day valet parking charge (seemed a little steep). Nonetheless, we would definitely stay here again.If you found this review and/or our photos helpful, we hope you will click the “helpful” button. Those of us who write reviews appreciate the feedback and it encourages us to write additional reviews for everyone’s consideration. Thank you."
5,Great Stay!,"This was my first time staying at an Intercontinental Hotel, and I was so pleased! I really appreciated the valet staff's kindness - they were exceedingly helpful. At checkin, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had received a complimentary upgrade. The room was stunning - so spacious! The bed was lovely and cozy. (Oh, and great robes!) We had a beautiful view of the city, and really enjoyed our time there. Danelle, Rebecca and Julie are phenomenal - so professional and kind. They made our stay wonderful, and we are so appreciative of their fine hospitality."
5,Wedding of our Dreams!,"Just to clarify, I give this place 5 stars for the day of our wedding and anything Julie Stanfield was involved with. Our day went absolutely perfect! I was the MOST relaxed bride and I had the best time. If there were issues, I knew nothing about them. We got SO many compliments on the food! It was delicious, we had our rehearsal dinner there as well and it went great! Julie is the most compassionate, sweet and organized person I've ever met. She did everything in her power to make to make our day special and she succeeded. I would advise any couple to avoid the current room block process with the hotel. It really wasn't worth the trouble. The rate they locked me into was way more expensive than the rooms that were booked last minute and because of the attrition policy I had to keep track of all the bookings on a spreadsheet of my own. The last thing you want to worry about is paying for rooms you don't use simply because people want to stay somewhere cheaper. They were nice enough to honor bookings from other sources like Expedia, but again the hassle of keeping up with it all was more stress than it was worth."
5,AMG/GT.S/AMG DRIVER ACADAMY AUSTIN,"I had a wonderful stay. The Managers, Concierges, Valets, Bartenders and Hotel Staff exceeded my expiations. The drinks, food were just right. My room accommodations were Excellent. I slept like a baby. Satisfied Guest, Tracy L Reed"
4,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location","Hotel was absolutely beautiful with grand features and decor. Our room was very spacious with a seating area and renovated bathroom. Staff were all courteous and helpful. Great location - easy to walk to various shops, restaurants and bars. Appreciated the water in the lobby after a long night of dinner and some drinks and walking around town! Nice bar with great outdoor seating overlooking the city streets. Overall good stay when in Austin!"
5,"beautiful, classic european style hotel","Service was great. On point, accurate, conscientious but not obsequious, prompt.Location was right in the middle of the city.Room is classic: small but well laid out and the bed was perfect.Only downside: bathroom requires a bit of updating.Décor was tasteful and soothing."
5,Nothing short of the InterContinental service...,"From check in to check out, my trip was flawless. I was in Austin on business, and the hotel could not have made it a more pleasant experience. My early morning room service order was accommodated to even before their ""operating hours"" because I had to leave earlier than expected for my meeting. My business partner forgot his laptop charger at home, and the hotel went to the extreme to locate a matching charger for his particular laptop.Great atmosphere in the restaurant and bar both nights we were there-- fish tacos are a must have!! If you're as lucky as I was, and your room faces the unforgettable view of the state capital, make sure to take it all in!"
5,Great in every way!,"Great location, staff, food and accommodations!Very nice staff, got in late and we got a late check out. When fire alarm started beeping because of batteries they extended the check out. Very nice! Spa was awesome!"
5,"Friendly service, perfect location","This hotel was perfectly located for my trip to see a concert at the Paramount. Very close to restaurants, nightlife, and the Catholic cathedral for Mass. Every person I encountered from the front desk to the room service staff were extremely helpful. The gym in the basement had up to date, high end treadmills and some weights. If you don't want to drive in the Austin traffic, this is a great choice for your stay."
5,Amazing Hotel,"Great staff all thru this hotel, from arrival to departure.Loved the location in the heart of Austin with easy walks to area attractions and the rooms were super clean, very spacious along with comfortable beds."
5,Perfection!,"From the moment I arrived, I experienced top notch service. The front desk staff was friendly and welcoming, and made everyone feel valued and important. The location is amazing, the restaurant is incredible, and the rooms are modern and comfortable. Overall great experience!"
2,Overpriced and outdated,Moved and stayed at jw Marriott for the same price but at least 3 times better. Room was goofy layout. Bathroom has a tiny pedestal sink. The club lounge advertised was supposed to have fresh baked pasteries but there wasn’t anything offered.
2,They can just do better...,"We stayed here for a date night and checked in a little after 4. The room was not ready upon check in, that wasn’t a big deal the front desk did give us drink coupons for the wait. We spent the day on the river so we needed a shower as soon as we got to the room, when I got a towel down from the in shower rack a men’s razor fell and hit me on my foot. I assumed the towels would be changed after each guest? Then my partner flipped a pillow over and found a larger make up stain (we hope it was make up). The room and staff were very nice, I just expect more from a 4 star hotel."
5,Return to the Stephen F Austin Hotel,"My family and I recently returned to the SFA after trying out another IHG property in Austin. While the other property was new and painfully hip, we found it was just not our speed. We could not wait to get back to the SFA’s classic ambiance and charm. I guess we’re marble floors, hardwood and grand staircase folks. It just feels like Texas to us. And who can beat the view of the Capitol Building from the balcony? As always, service was top notch, with our concierge, Eleni, providing us with valuable dining insight in her cosmopolitan Chicago style. Everyone was great; from the staff at the 2nd floor bar, the Roaring Fork and the breakfast staff to the gents in valet. Impeccable. Can’t wait to come back to a classic hotel for discerning adults.Cheers!"
5,Perfect Stay at the InterContinental!,"Jester went above and beyond to make our anniversary a perfect one. The hotel staff was incredible! Would definitely recommend to anyone/everyone! I was given an upgraded room, champagne, drink tickets and wifi all without charge. Definitely the best hotel experience I've ever had!"
1,Worst hotel stay ever!,"I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and this was by far the worst experience I’ve ever had. From checking in to trying to communicate with the front desk- absoute nightmare. Never again will I choose to stay here, not when I have plenty of other options. They didn’t have the room I requested upon checking so I was forced to pay to upgrade. We decided to stay in the upgraded room the second night of our stay and told the front desk. The man working acted like “why are you telling me...” I should have expected the knock on the door hours later asking us to vacate the room. How embarrassing! Had to explain the situation again. They kept charging my debit card over and over again. They ended up taking TRIPLE the amount out of my account (luckily I had the funds or I would have been charged overdraft fees) after having to call the hotel everyday durning and after our stay for 3 days I finally spoke with an accountant who was the only person who could explain and reverse the funds. Never- and I mean NEVER again!"
5,Chic,Nice historical chic hotel with amazing customer service. Front desk was great. Concierge knew how to assist based on what I wanted to do. Great bell guys always so king. It's a wow factor since you arrive at the hotel.
3,Dakota’s stay.,"Hello. I had a nice stay weekend before Labor Day. Although I was given two beds instead of one, was in a hurry when I checked in so I didn’t report this. Bed was not the comfiest. Had a tough tome finding water in the lobby as it seemed to always be empty. Enjoyed my stay but it was about worthy of a 3/5"
5,Overall happy with the location,"Keep up the good work, very clean and comfortable, I enjoyed the stay in your hotel and Austin itself , very pleasant. very nice, convenient, thank you for all your serviceeeeeeeeeeee.nice, nice,nice, nice, nice, nice , nice, nice , nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice,"
5,1st time visitor,"Great hotel, very beautiful. Love the Bar on the second floor. just wish they had Happy Hour on Saturdays.Since they had no Happy hour, we went to Trulucks and enjoyed their Happy hour, which was amazing. My other complaint was the high parking fee, I realize many of the Austin hotels have double the parking fee, but I feel its outrageous. We chose to park in a different garage for $18.00 instead of paying the $42-$47 the hotel charges."
5,Staying downtown Austin? InterContinental Stephen F. Austin is THE hotel to stay at.,InterContinental goes over and beyond for their customers. I recently had a company meeting held in one of the conference rooms and I must say this hotel is top-tier. The breakfast offered(The sausage bits) was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place that feels like home away from home.
4,Very nicely done!,Just had the pleasure of staying at this Intercontinental and was excellent. Room was huge and staff was right on top of everything. All the amenities were up to date. valet was a breeze. I would highly recommend this historic hotel for your next stay in Austin
5,Long Weekend Getaway,A no nonsense stay at a great play. Miss Austin and this hotel made it feel like I lived back there. Friendly and courteous they all were my entire trip. The location was perfect and to top it off valet was awesome. Never waited long and they always greeted me with my name. Enjoyable stay all around.
5,Lovely place...,I've been in Austin a few times in the last few years...I still return every time to this beautiful place with great service!!!...Totally recommended whenever you are in Austin!!!...Walking distance to great places to visit in the city!...
5,Great service,This is a great place to stay. Friendly and clean every employee was always helpful. It’s location is right in the middle of everything. Minutes from the capital and 6th street entertainment! Will stay here again!
5,A Class Act,"This was my second time staying at the InterContinental, and it will continue to be my hotel of choice when visiting Austin. Lovely, clean, great location, fabulous service from EVERYONE. I appreciate the security of needing a room key in order to access the elevator to the upper floors."
5,Perfect balance,Not as big as some of the large chain hotels which is a good thing. Perfect location downtown and staff is far and away as good as or better than any place in town (including the winter/spring/summer/fall place).
5,Lovely stay,"The staff made my 5 day stay enjoyable and I will definitely recommend this lovely hotel. The room was well-appointed, the bed was extremely comfortable, and every staff member I encountered made it a point to smile and always be helpful. Thank you."
5,alipops,really nice hotel located close to the capital building and walking distance to some nice bars and restaurants...friendly and helpful staff...nice sized rooms and comfy beds...even the sofa bed !..we used the well equipt gym and pool/jacuzzi area which would have been even better with a steam room and sauna but very nice even so. would definitely stay again if ever in Austin
4,Need a bigger Refrigerator,"Loved the hotel, but the refrigerator in the room was filled with drinks and snacks, so the guest had no room to store and drinks or snacks. The drinks and snacks were overpriced, so no one in their right mind would drink or eat them."
5,Great place to stay in Austin,"This hotel works hard to make your stay memorable. I've stayed here many times, and my standard for great service on a single great trip, but consistently great service over every trip. This hotel pulls it off. The property is beautiful and well maintained. Rooms are newly remodeled and very comfortable. Every service person from the doorman, receptionist to the chamber maids wants to be helpful.And, the location can't be beat. It's right in the center of the downtown area."
5,"Nice hotel, confusing floor layout and excellent restaurant","Booked this hotel without ever having been in Austin before. It's a great location, close to 6th Street music scene, if that appeals to you but not so close that you're in the middle of it. Nice restaurants nearby. My room was small but very comfortable. Gym was large and there's a lap pool. I had a fantastic meal at Roaring fork, the restaurant in the lobby. I also recommend the nearby Driskill bakery for breakfast. All in all an enjoyable stay for a short business trip."
5,Austin Intercontinental,"The staff was incredibly nice and welcoming, especially with my children. I will definitely stay here again. The rooms were comfortable, the staff made excellent recommendations for local cuisine and hangouts."
5,I love this hotel,Everyone is nice and courteous! The location cannot be even better. 1 block from the 6th street😉 i would definitely recommend this place to all my friends! Best quality for the price you pay with all other hotels!
5,Good hotel,"Good location, close to everything I needed. Lots of bars and restaurants. Convenient valet. Competitively priced. Was in town for a wedding and was able to walk to the reception and enjoy cocktails in the lounge."
5,Wonderful staff and pet friendly!,"My family and I stayed for the weekend and love this property ! Our furry family member (pug!) was a celebrity from the start! Photos with staff and guests and a huge shout out to Vinny, a manager, for providing ‘pupcicles” And various treat for our pet! So sweet and lovely ! Staff is top notch and our corner room was cozy and comfy! Great location downtown! We will definitely be coming back soon! Thank you again !!!The Gonzalez Family"
5,We will always stay here!,"This was our second stay, and we love this hotel. We love sitting out on the terrace off the bar and enjoying the view and the drink. The breakfast via room service isn’t always a treat. We will be back."
4,"Great location, beautiful facility.","This hotel is very nice, friendly staff, and fantastic location to downtown sights. My only complaint is that the parking is super expensive and the rooms are very small.If you go, join their rewards program (it's free) because then you can have free internet."
5,"Secure, clean and friendly","This is a beautiful building and a great location in downtown Austin. The building is secure and the staff are friendly people. The pillows are too soft, the room (1203) has poor air circulation and they offer no parking or breakfast. Otherwise it is good as gold."
5,Great Hotels,Nice hotel with very friendly staff. The room was large and the bed was comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a downtown Austin hotel. Close to everything and the hotel has a great restaurant too.
5,One of the best in the IHG chain.,"I’ve had the pleasure of having many functions at your hotel. They have all gone smoothly and your staff has been amazing every time! I finally was able to stay at the hotel and I was impressed. Wonderful amenities, very comfortable bed and a quiet room. The staff here is amazing! The bellmen are the best of the best! Amazing wine list, fun bar, great vibe! Perfect location if staying downtown too! The managers of this hotel run a tight ship and it shows in a positive way! I love this hotel and can’t thank them enough for all they’ve done for me and my team over the years!"
5,Great Hotel - Great location,This is a great hotel located right in the center of Austins business district close to many restaurants and bars. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself very immaculate and clean. We will definitely be coming back! William
5,"The hotel was very comfortable, Great location for site seeing in Austin..","Well located to explore downtown Austin, within walking distance to all the action packed venues on sixth street or the Texas State Capitol Building and Museums etc... plenty of places within easy reach."
5,Comfortable stay,We stayed one night while passing through Austin. The bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and quiet. The front desk staff and bellmen were all very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again if we are back in Austin.
5,Gem Of Austin,"This hotel far exceeds expectations! Everyone that works at the hotel are nice, pleasant and always smiling.Rooms have been updated and are incredible. Beautifully finished. Beds are ever so comfortable, which is a must for me!The hotel is in the middle of everything. Downtown location that gives you access to great dining and music!Have been staying at this hotel every time I come to Austin. 10 years plus!"
4,Refuge in a sea of...,"Downtown Austin is infested with not only the typical post-60's weird, but also a huge number of homeless. The stink of the streets, the begging, and the feeling of being in a third-world country can be a bit disheartening to one who remembers the pretty, clean city of not all so long ago.This hotel was a nice, clean refuge with friendly staff, though the street noise kept one of our party awake at night."
5,Austin's Best Downtown Hotel,If you want the best hotel in downtown Austin the Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin is for you. It's 5 star in my book and convenient to everything. You can walk to all the great restaurants and downtown entertainment venues in a matter of minutes. The Three Forks restaurant is located in the hotel plus the breakfast I had at the hotel was scrumptious. Whether you want Huevos Rancheros or Egss Benedict you can't go wrong here.
5,Beautiful!,This hotel is worth every cent and the staff is wonderful! The staff was accommodating and acted happy to see everyone. It was a great night! Wish I stayed longer with my husband! I will definitely bring him next time!
5,Fantastic stay,Hotel was great! Jester met me at the front desk and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Rooms were well appointed with some cool tech stuff. Hotel was conveniently located. Staff was overall very helpful and I would go back.
5,Married-couple getaway,"My wife and I had an absolutely perfect time at the InterContinental Stephen F Austin, in downtown Austin, TX. A beautiful hotel, wonderful amenities, and a very attentive and professional staff! We highly recommend this hotel for its superb location, comfortable rooms, and all at a great rate! We’ll definitely be back!"
5,Simply superb - Intercontinenal Austin,"Intercontinental in Austin is a superb hotel...whether you are weekending or on business. The staff is amazing, rooms are so well appointed and the restaurants and catering at this property have no equal. Just came back from a meeting and series of seminars with breakfasts, lunches and dinners that took place at the Intercontinental in Austin and would return week after week, if I could...it feels like home but with better accommodations and outstanding food. Everything was seamless from start to finish. Many thanks to Vinny D'Agostino and his F&B Team for all their efforts and hard work."
5,Lovely Hotel,"Everything about the IC SFA was wonderful. The room, though small, was nicely appointed. It might have been crowded for two people, but for one it was perfect. The reception desk employees were polite and helpful. Much of downtown Austin was within easy walking distance, and public transportation/tour options were nearby as well."
4,Great Place,If we wouldn't have asked for early check in ... we probably wouldn't have gotten the room with the larger than life roof top a/c unit out of our window. Since we weren't there to stay in our room and we were happy to unpack and change in order to spend time with our son ... we didn't care about the a/c unit. The room and the hotel were very nice and very comfortable.
4,A great deal,"I always like to book rooms direct, but this time I was able to book the InterContinental via priceline and got a tremendous deal for two nights. The location is great in that it is far enough away from sixth street to be quiet, yet close enough to walk and enjoy the bars if you want. The Hotel is Classic. Great Atmosphere and location. My room was very nice, almost felt like a suite. The staff and amenities are nice, if you don't feel like travelling out they have all the bases covered. I didn't utilize the restaurant, but the bar was very nice and the staff was on par. I definitely would stay again and actually signed up for there Rewards program just based on this location. Definitely would recommend."
4,"Great location, clean, nice staff, very firm bed","Positives: good location, clean, friendly staff, I really liked the vanity in the bathroom to get ready for the day.Neutral: mini fridge was full of snacks, I had to request items be removed so I could place my bottled water in it, they brought me a separate mini fridge, hot tub and pool were in the basement, so I couldn’t lay out and enjoy the sun, no where to park/valet is expensive.Negative: extremely firm bed (too hard for my liking, I didn’t sleep very well), room wasn’t cleaned until nearly 3pm."
5,A great experience,"If your looking for a true Texan experience, stay at the Intercontinental. Its rustic looking and you get the true feel of Texas. Also the restaurant downstairs is amazing. The staff is friendly and I honestly don't think I had to open the door once."
5,"Amazing Stay, top quality service",Now stayed a few times at the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin and the hotel is decedent and elegant. The service at the hotel is better than almost any hotel I've ever stayed. If you want to feel like a king stay at the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin.
5,Great Service,"My friends and I recently traveled to this hotel in Austin and had a truly wonderful experience. While the room was beautiful and the décor was amazing, the best part of the experience was the caring and attentive service that we experienced from the Front Desk team that discreetly but effectively helped us with our needs and wants,Special ""shout outs"" to Eric, Vincent at the front desk for the great guest service! Also great location!!!"
4,The hotel fell short of several things but the staff was fantastic!,"We were there for a week from July 14th to the 20th. Shortfalls: Housekeeping did not finish making bed, did not restock toilet paper and tissues, did not pick up a dropped paper towel, did not vacuum room. When we called the front desk the issues were quickly remedied. Show stoppers; the concierge pair were fantastic. They gave us detailed instructions and ideas to visit, dine and great funky neighborhoods to dine and shop. The front desk were responsive and very pleasant. The valet were super fast, friendly and also gave us great ideas to do while in Austin."
5,Awesome!,"Perfect location to 6th Street. The room was very comfortable and the staff was amazing and very helpful.. Would stay here again in a heartbeat! We loved everything about this hotel, the staff and it's location."
5,Great experience,"Everything was nice from the very first welcome! The staff is dedicated to make sure you have a nice stay (even greeting you by your name when you pass by the front desk), the room was spacious and well furnished, the hotel quiet. The location is great as well, in the very center of the city and steps away from major landmarks/activities."
5,An Oasis,"I arrived at the hotel and used the valet (recommended) I checked in at the front desk and Manuel was very pleasant and helpful. The lobby is beautiful and a nice restaurant is located adjacent to it. I had to use my guest key to access the elevator which is a nice security feature. The room was very nice. Comfortable bed, great A/C. There were a robe and slippers to wear, too! The hotel is conveniently located a block away from the nightlife of 6th Street without all the noise associated with the music that other hotels must contend with."
5,Nice Hotel With A Great Location,"We checked into the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin for one night and were impressed with the hotel's central location. Being right in the middle of the city, it is easy to access restaurants, bars, and all that downtown Austin has to offer. Our room was comfortable and clean and we lucked out with a room on a higher floor and on the corner so we had a fun view of the skyline and the street below. All employees at the hotel were super nice and accommodating. We look forward to returning to this hotel the next time we are in Austin!"
5,Great location & pet friendly,The hotel is in a great location in DT Austin. We brought our dog to the hotel and they were pet friendly. You can’t leave your dog alone in your room so if that’s an issue for you this hotel my not work. It will cost you $100 per visit to have your pet but overall we had a good experience. Staff was friendly and the room was very well kept. Pool was inside nothing special. We parked on the street and paid for street parking because hotel parking is $42 a day. You can download the meter app and just reload from your phone. Parking is free on Sundays. Street parking cost $1 an hr Monday-Saturday 8am-12am. It was expensive but the quality and location are very high end. They also accommodated early check in and a king bed request
5,Great end to a great holiday,"I have just spent 15 mins giving you the best revue to the best hotel on our trip.only to start again because there seems to be a problem with comp link,never mind I will re iterate.Watched World cup matches in Foyer and Room,England did well,shame USA wasnt in it this time,would have been interesting.Advised by your front desk on our only free day to go to the Bob Bullock Museum,this was great as it gave us a history lesson in everything from the Alamo to moon landingsonce again thank you to Vincenco D,agostino for the las afternoon with drink and snacks on the balcony,after visiting Chicago,Nashville,Memphis,New Orleans and Dallas,The pool and Spa and Gym were great"
5,Great stay at the Austin Intercontinental Hotel,The staff at the Austin Intercontinental Hotel was amazing. They went above and beyond to help me during my stay both helping me with a problem that I had and recommending great things to do. Would stay there again.
5,Fourth of July Treat!,"My stay was for just one night, an anniversary of sorts. The Stephen F will never disappoint. From front desk clerks to hotel and dining staff, I was recognized at every turn. Can't say enough about Eleni Varnavas at the Concierge Desk, or Trevor and the various restaurant managers and staff. Everyone took the time for a warm welcome. Always happens at the Stephen F."
5,"HISTORIC CHARACTER, PERSONALIZED SERVICE and GREAT FOOD","The staff at the Stephen F. Austin Intercontinental Hotel are aiming to please - especially Jennifer in the Sales Department, Eleni the Concierge and Geraldo the Valet.I just stayed for 5 nights and really enjoyed my stay!The location is great, the rooms are comfortable, clean and the food is very good. You have to try out Roaring Fork, which is located right in the hotel lobby.I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Austin."
5,Outstanding - will always return.,"I stay in hotels every week for business. Stephen F. Austin is top notch in service, room quality, view (Capitol), tasteful decor, cleanliness, wonderful bed and pillows, and historic architecture. Best of all, Concierge Donna hand- delivered my work UPS packages to an office 3 blocks away so I had them for a meeting. The veranda on the 2nd floor is the perfect place to catch up on nighttime email under the summer sky, barefoot after a day of meetings. I now stay in IHG whenever possible - consistently enjoyable."
5,Center of DT Austin,Great location if you want to be in the thick of it. Good food all around and you are only a few miles from other Austin attractions. Lime and Bird scooter made it fun to zip around the city when you didn't want or need to drive.
5,Excellent hotel in perfect location!,This hotel is extremely well located for someone who wants to be right in the downtown of Austin while still appreciate a bit of a relaxing place when it is too hot outside. Staffs are all very friendly and accommodating.
5,Great Service,"What a wonderful experience in Downtown Austin. They have the perfect location to easily walk around. The customer service was spot on and their concierge team was a ""wow"" factor for sure! Keep up the great work."
5,Bar at Intercontinental,"Hotel was excellent. Check-in service was very accommodating, and although mini-bar was overpriced, it was fully stocked. Journey and Adam at the 2nd floor lounge were amazing! Suggested several awesome drinks, and had great suggestions for area attractions."
5,Old Town Austin,"Beautiful old school hotel in the heart of Downtown Austin great and friendly staff, wonderful bar and all around clean. Thank you thank you and appreciate the great staff and friendly service. The bar was awesome and the outdoor bar ledge was like a taste of New Orleans smack dab in the middle of Downtown Austin"
5,Great Hotel in Perfect Location,"I was so glad to stay at the Stephen F, Austin Intercontinental hotel in Austin Texas. The room was beautiful, and quiet. The hotel staff was informative, friendly and gracious. They even offered me an umbrella when it rained one day--something that has never happened in all my stays at nice hotels. Will absolutely come back on my next visit."
4,My Stay in Austin,"Great location, and awesome architecture. Spacious room and bathroom. Friendly, professional staff. The interior could use some updating (most specifically the carpet). I love the bedside light control and the fact that the room's telephone could be used as an electronics charger."
1,Wouldn't recommend. Poor customer service.,"My business trip was cancelled and the third party site I used to make the reservation would offer a full refund if the hotel would agree. 100% of the time, the hotel has agreed in the past and were understanding of the situation. I spoke directly with Manager Eric Akins who was aggressive, blunt and extremely rude. He could have easily handled the situation in a more professional manner. I would not recommend staying here to anyone if a Manager treats their guests like this."
5,My new favorite hotel in Austin!,"I recently stayed at this beautiful hotel right in the middle of historic downtown 6th street in austin, tx. From the very moment I pulled up, I was greeted by a young man named Jason who readily helped me with my bags and was so polite and charming! Once he pulled back the big, brass doors, I entered the hotel and immediately felt like royalty! Not only was the gorgeous imperial staircase the centerpiece of this inviting lobby, but the sweetest voice of a woman named Rene called out to me, giving me the warmest welcome I've ever felt! She was so courteous and engaged me as if we had known each other for years. She had the biggest smile on her face and seems to really enjoy her job because was super knowledgable and she didn't hesitate to let me know everything I needed to know about the hotel; before I could even ask 'what time breakfast starts', (it's like she had read my mind, haha), she let me know the hours of the dining club and what I needed to do to become a member etc. Once I got upstairs, my room was absolutely mind blowing. I wish I knew who cleans those rooms, I'd mention them too, because they definitely work hard and it shows! I will say the sheets were tucked in too tight, (like military style) but the softness of it all made up for me having to untuck the bottom of the bed. (Haha) My fellow travler's, you do not know what it's like to sleep on a cloud until you sleep in one of these beds! My goodness the rooms were just so pristine, and well kept! I ended up sleeping in the next morning and missed breakfast,as they were just putting everything away, but I still got a chance to see the dining area which is staged so elegantly. Before I checked out, Manuel, I believe was his name, suggested that I stroll up to the second floor and check out the terrace that's attached to their signature in-house bar. What a view of the Capital! I was really blown away, aesthetically, by the whole hotel, really. I'm just amazed. This is definitely my go to hotel from now on when I come to austin!! Stephen F. Austin, you are the best!"
5,Very nice!,Extremely pleased with our stay! Everyone from the front desk to the valet drivers were extremely helpful and prompt to our needs. The room was very comfortable and included all the amenities needed.Convenient to the Capital and down town restaurants.
4,Good location,"This is a beautiful restored hotel in the heart of downtown Austin. Walking distance to many attractions. We had a large corner room w. sitting area and huge bath, w. separate dressing table. Polite hotel staff and parking staff. Our location was quiet, didn't face Congress."
4,Especially good for women travelers,"Second time I stayed here and really liked it. Has a more relaxed feel than one of the larger, convention-focused hotels. Love that there’s a little counter and seat area in the bathroom for all of your stuff. There’s plugs for all your devices in-room, the lights and AC come on and off when you walk in the room and there’s a bedside panel to switch off the lights or adjust the temp. Comfortable beds. Decent gym. No outdoor pool if that’s important to you. The room on this second visit (801) was considerably smaller than my first - so will add a special request if I stay again for a larger room if possible."
5,Excellent Care,"I was not feeling well upon my arrival. The very kind man (from Puerto Rico) who checked me in gave me tums and sent tea up to my room. It was a thoughtful gesture. The rooms were fabulous, clean, and comfortable."
5,Great hotel,"A great hotel full of historical charm inside. Comfy beds, clean, big bathrooms in a standard room. Great meeting spaces. Friendly staff. Neighborhood has many restaurants and nightlife within walking distance."
5,Gorgeous Hotel,"Beautiful rooms and amazingly comfy beds. Was upgraded to a King Suite. Service is pristine from the valet, front desk, Club Lounge Trevor, to the Concierge Andrew Brett! The Roaring Fork restaurant has a view of the Capitol! The location to walking 6th St at night is right there. Truly enjoyable!"
5,Love this hotel,I absolutely love this hotel. My wife and I have stayed there a few times over the years and have enjoyed it every time. The staff is very friendly and bends over backwards to make you stay even better. This month is my wife’s 50th b-day and we chose the Stephen F again to celebrate. Donna in guest relations was absolutely fantastic! She made sure this milestone would be remembered. Thank you!!!!
5,Love this hotel!,"This is a genuinely comfortable and unique hotel, service and attention to guests is worth the experience. Room amenities make you feel at home. Food and bar have great ambience. Love sitting outside on balcony relaxing at night at the bar."
5,This is probably our all time favorite hotel,"We stay at the SFA a couple of times of year and always look forward to seeing the staff-- it must be a great place to work because so many of them have been there the past 7 years. Great service, comfy beds, quick response if a problem ever occurs-- it's just a fun place to be and centrally located so it's easy to walk to bars, restaurants, movies, the lake, the capitol and even South Congress if you are a real walker."
5,Great Hotel! Great Location,"Great Hotel with fabulous service right off Congress and 6th Street! This hotel appears to be historic in its design and lobby and nicely appointed rooms. The lounge on the 2nd floor and balcony are a great place to step out and see the capital building a few blocks away, along with the Paramount Theater."
5,InterContinental Stephen F. Austin,"This is a wonderful property with extremely accommodating staff. Its location in the heart of downtown Austin makes for walking to restaurants, shopping and nightlife very convenient. As an Intercontinental Platinum Ambassador, we received an upgrade to a one bedroom suite along with several other amenities. We definitely will stay at this hotel for our future visits to Austin."
5,"Great location, great stay","Had a great stay at this hotel. Super friendly staff... lovely girl who checked me in. Couldn’t have been more helpful. Beautiful clean rooms, great restaurant. Very happy with the location. Only thing that would have helped was if there were chargers at the lobby tables."
4,Great downtown location,"I was in town for 4 days for work and booked this because the hotel where my colleagues were was not available. I had a room on the 5th floor that didn't have a view but no matter, I was only here to sleep. The room was very comfortable and quiet.The only issue I had while here was the third day of my stay, while in the room for a few minutes to change to go to dinner, there was a knock at the door. A woman from the hotel said she was there to restock my mini-bar. I told her no need, I had not touched it. While out for dinner, I was thinking of this as it was bothering me because, she only had a clip board and no cart with items to actually restock it. This made me think she was actually going to do inventory and they probably had charges for me. When I got back that evening, I called the front desk and first got a story that they never restocked it from the guest before me and they were sorry about that, but then he told me that they did see that I took items and they had charges on my bill. I told them that was incorrect and they needed to remove them. It just concerns me that if I had not been in my room during that time, they would have had charges on my bill during check out and I probably would have had to dispute them then which is always harder. And, I am still not sure how they had them on there in the first place."
5,Amazing stay!,"Wow this place blew me away! Service was incredible, the room was impeccable. After working for 23 in the hotel business as GM & Director of housekeeping I’m used to inspecting any room I check in. Let me tell you I looked for something to be wrong and I couldn’t find nothing wrong. NOTHING! This hotel has everything you’d want. From the location to all the amenities they offer, very impressive. Be sure to use the pool! Enjoy the happy hour they provide complimentary in the lobby. I met some of the most wonderful people staying here. Simply wow! From the housekeeping crew to the desk agent and manager we had an incredible stay. Everyone is so attentive. Thank you!!"
5,Best experience in Austin,"The hotel has the best staff , great location and a very warm feeling to it.It is modern with class and charm.The rooms are very comfortable and the terrace is great venue throughout the day. Always a nice breeze even on very hot days.Overall, I think it makes visiting Austin more pleasant."
5,Staff are Super Friendly,"Really enjoyed my stay - staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was nice/clean. Would definitely recommend to others. Only issue was got very hot in the gym, needs to be cooler. Overall a great experience."
5,Gorgeous property.,The lobby area has that Grand-Age-of-hotels look and feel but up to date and in great condition. Entry area has plenty of elevators - no waiting. Room was spacious and meticulously clean. Check-in was quick and effortless. Great stay.
4,intercontinental austin,"good stay, was only one night, as mentioned previously I am concerned that a small nick was made in the side of my car which was valet'ed there. I have not had the car out of my own care any other time"
5,LUXURY!,"This hotel is soo nice. I was able to book it at the last minute at under the GSA rate, so I totally lucked out! The staff is very helpful. The Roaring Fork is delicious.It is a bit pricey, but if you can afford it, this place is worth it."
5,Home,"The staff does a great job and always makes me feel comfortable and welcome. It is almost like staying with extended family. It starts with valet park and goes to bell services, the front desk, the bar staff and guest services."
5,"perfect location, wonderful staff",Every staff member we encountered was lovely. The location is perfect and we were so pleased when were were able to check in early. Be aware that valet parking is about $40 a day but that's standard for a downtown hotel.
5,centrally located and beautifully appointed,"The hotel is right downtown and central to everything. The room was beautiful and well kept up by housekeeping. I felt very safe in the hotel, and was very pleased with the stay. You need to access the elevator with your key, so it was very nice when I was there alone"
5,Beautiful Place to Stay,"We recently stayed at the Intercontinental in Austin and were delighted by the entire experience. I am an experienced traveler who is extremely particular about where I stay. I thoroughly researched all accommodations in Austin before booking at The Intercontinental and I could not have been happier with my choice. The hotel is absolutely lovely. The location is in the middle of the city close to all attractions, restaurants, and bars. The hotel itself is historic and beautifully maintained. The room was simply incredible with lovely appointments, cleanliness beyond belief, and luxurious soaps and shampoos. The bed was one of the best parts of the whole experience. I am not sure where they purchased the mattress, pillows, and bedding, but I don’t think I have ever enjoyed such comfort. It was truly over the top. When staying in Austin, treat yourself to The Intercontinental. You won’t be disappointed and you will be so glad that you chose this hotel."
5,Journey,"Our bartender, Journey, was amazing. She was so welcoming and engaging, it felt like I was home. And seeing as how I’m a recent transplant to Austin, it was nice to experience that feeling. Thanks Journey, we will back to see you soon!!!"
4,Quick Stay at Austin Intercontinental,"We just returned from a one night stay at the InterContinental Stephen F Austin. We had a very enjoyable stay. The staff was very helpful and pointed out that we could get free wifi if we joined their loyalty club. The valet was very helpful in deciding whether to use our car or uber to our event and quickly got our car out at 5:30 a.m. when we were leaving. The room was nice, though this is an older property and the room was a bit small. This is more of an issue with the bathroom, which was too small to even put out toiletries for two people, though there was a small free-standing shelf next to the sink to give at least a bit of shelf room. The only other downside was the $45 a night for parking. Austin is terrible for parking, but this seemed over-the-top excessive. they did a good job of adding some additional outlets to the room so we could get all our electronics charged. We were on a lower floor, but still had a nice view of the neighboring properties.The 4 rating is based mainly on the bathroom size. Other than that it was a very nice hotel, but the bathroom just did not measure up to what I expect from 5 stars."
5,Comfortable Stay in Downtown Austin,"The Intercontinental is ideally located downtown. It is within walking distance of the state capitol, UT, Lady Bird Lake, downtown shopping and music venues on 5th and 6th street. Also historic St. David's Episcopal Church is very near. Staff was very friendly. We enjoyed happy hour at the 2nd floor bar each night. Bartender made very good recommendations about places to eat and things to do in Austin. The Roaring Fork restaurant on the first floor is not a part of the hotel operation, but it is a franchise restaurant that leases space in the hotel. It was excellent. The rooms have all the usual Intercontinental amenities plus a mini-bar with outrageous prices. The hotel is in an old building but in good condition. Standard rooms tend to be a bit small, but certainly adequate. Valet parking is the only option at $42/night. Overall a very comfortable stay in a very convenient location."
5,Best part of my trip,"After a harrowing experience, including sleeping in the DFW terminal overnight, checking into the Stephen F. Austin Intercontinental was definitely the best part of my trip. Luxurious beds, plenty of towels and of course the pool and hot tub made a great way to wrap up my day."
5,"If you're looking for the best hotel in Austin, stop looking!","We spent Memorial Day weekend at the Intercontinental as a mini-getaway. We were welcomed with some yummy cookies, cheese and wine...a special treat for staying in the Governor's Suite. The suite is gorgeous with stunning views of downtown Austin. The Capital is directly out of the Master Suite bedroom and it is spectacular at night especially! We honestly felt we were in the lap of luxury! The Jacuzzi tub is enormous and could have fit our entire family in it! The beds were so comfy everyone slept fabulously both night, which is unusual for our family. Besides gorgeous decor, the suite had everything we needed and more, including an espresso maker, Keurig, mini fridge and microwave. All of these things make traveling with a young child so much easier!The staff couldn't have been nicer and all of the meals were delicious. The location is perfect with access to so many things within easy walking distance, including Lady Bird Lake.We loved our stay so much, we will definitely return in the very near future!"
4,Solid choice for downtown Austin,"I spent two nights at this property. The room was updated, clean, excellent mattress. Amenities and restaurants / bar are excellent. Parking is an issue so plan on using the valet. It is pricey at ~$42/day.Lots of restaurants in the general vicinity."
5,Great stay!,"Stayed at the InterContinental for graduation weekend in Austin and it was such a great experience. Wonderful hotel and would definitely stay again! Just a tip: You have to ask for your room to be cleaned. Usually, I know there is a do not disturb card, but little did I know the other-side is for house keeping, otherwise they wont come."
5,Excellent all around; read the info cards,"From check-in to check-out, everything here was excellent. Super helpful staff, large, beautiful room, decently equipped fitness room. Excellent location with lots of restaurants nearby, yet very quiet inside the hotel. One tip - read the helpful cards in the room to save yourself several minutes of searching for outlets."
5,Quiet and stately,"Historical hotel with a stately, quiet atmosphere. The 2nd floor wrap around balcony is a good place to enjoy an evening drink. The room was well appointed and clean.This excellent hotel is located next door to the Paramount Theater, and when coupled with a concert it made a great overnight getaway."
5,Overall service,Everything was great. Excellent hotel and staff. Nick at registration was especially helpful and went out of his way to assist me. Housekeeping personnel did a great job...efficient and professional. The restaurant on the premises was superb with great food and service...most convenient.
5,Incredible service and staff,"Above all my stay was incredible. Mostly due to the great staff on hand. My room server Jay Carr was the most respectable, courteous and professional young man. He clearly takes his job serious and it definitely shows. Amazing job!"
5,GREAT LOCATION,"The InterContinential Stephen F. Austin is a fabulous hotel. in a great location. Any direction you turn takes you to a different area of Austin. The Staff couldn't have been nicer, especially in the Club Room on the first floor of the hotel. The breakfast was plentiful and had a good variety of food to choose from. The room and bed was large and comfortable. The shower was powerful. I would definitely go back."
5,Favorite hotel in Austin!,"Always enjoy this hotel! Great location and great bar! Be sure and request the club to have access to drinks and bites at happy hour as well as great breakfast buffet. Also, check room SF before you book to get a little larger room and bathroom. Charming hotel!"
5,Wonderful Hotel & Staff!!,Our room was so comfortable with technology to make changing the room temp to turning lights off and on at your fingertips. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely be back for another relaxing weekend.
4,Best Sleep Ever!!!,"Love, love, love the bed. I had the best sleep ever. Would definitely recommend this hotel for weary travellers. Was in town for a graduation at UT Austin and this hotel was close to everything and within walking distance so no need for a car."
5,Great one night stay in Austin,Great Historic Hotel with great staff. Hotel bar was very nice and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again on our return visits to Austin. Location of the hotel is great with close access to many bars and restaurants. We did not have time to visit the hotel restaurant but is now on our list.
5,Nice full service well located,"Nice hotel. Friendly staff. Clean. Good location. I checked in early and no rooms were available, but they upgraded me and had a room available in about 15 minutes. I had to check my luggage during the day after I checked out. Geraldo Rivera, no kidding, was the bell man. He was super. A friendly enthusiastic employee that put a face on this place. He should get a bonus. I paid $237 including taxes for one night."
5,"Lovely, boutique hotel","Hotel restaurant served great food, and hotel bar on second floor plush and relaxing.Rooms were nice and clean -- appreciated that they even provided an umbrella in the closet.Room service was prompt and good.Staff was very friendly and helpful."
5,"Beautiful room, friendly staff, great location",The staff was friendly and helpful from my first moment in the door. The location is fantastic for tourists and business travelers. There are many interesting restaurants and fun bars with in walking distance. The room was clean and modern. Great hotel!
5,Comfortable and quiet,"I stayed one weekend in April at the IC Stephen F. Austin.Intercontinental is my favorite hotel brand, and the location in Austin didn’t disappoint. The hotel was cozy, comfortable and had character. The bed was super.Service was excellent all around: valet, front desk, bar, housekeeping and breakfast.I loved the bar’s outdoor second-floor terrace that wrapped around the building.Downtown Austin has many new hotel choices, but I recommend this historic, first class property."
5,"Great stay, as always - thanks Manuel!","We love the InterContinental in Austin. We have stayed here a couple other times for business and leisure, and each stay impresses us more!On our most recent stay, Manuel checked us in and went above and beyond. There was a large conference in the lobby, as well as a wine tasting. I do not like large crowds and noises, and Manuel took notice. He offered us a complimentary drink, away from the crowd and spoke to us as if he were our friend - love it! From what we gathered, he just started at the property, and they are lucky to have him.It turns out that we are actually celebrating our anniversary while I finished up my business meetings for the week, so the small treat Manuel provided made such a huge, positive difference.The room and amenities are impeccable, as always. Free coffee in the lobby is wonderful! I feel like parking is a little stiff, but we are typically not in the room and I leave for meetings early in the morning (we park in the garage).Location is great. Right in the middle of downtown, but still quiet.We are looking forward to our next stay!!"
5,Will definitely be going back.,No complaints whatsoever. Would not have minded the fridge having a little more space for personal use (medications and regularly priced sodas). Great views of downtown and the capitol. Luxurious and comfortable bedding. Nice bright and spacious suite.
4,Austin,"Great hotel very reasonable prices with old glamour style at center of downtown Austin, give time to visit the Capital building and experience great Austin hospitality. Texas at its best a great cosmopolitan city with top notch restaurants and lounges , shout out to Coopers BBQ a few blocks away delicious meals more on my travels on instagram"
2,Service Lacking,"When I arrived at the hotel, I was having trouble with my luggage and even thought Valet was outside and he looked at me and did not offer any assistance. Check in agent was not helpful. I am an Ambassador and when asked about my amenities she simply said"
5,Awesome Introduction,"We had stepped into the lobby of this beautiful hotel just to see what it looked like. Beautiful open arms staircase. We opened a door into a lovely dining area. It turns out it was only for reward members and it is called the relaxation time. Members are offered a complete spread of tasty small plate items. Even though the it was closing time Jay and Saad sat us down, brought us a plate of dessert and extolled the benefits of become a rewards member. I am definitely becoming a member."
4,Wedding Weekend in Austin,"Good, central location in downtown Austin.Extremely personable and helpful staffWi-Fi available and easy to accessBuffet breakfast had great selection of items for varied tastes and palatesWould definitely recommend to friends"
4,Central Austin,"If you want to be in the middle of downtown Austin one can do worse than staying at the SFA. Great location with a decent restaurant and bar. My room was a bit small, but fine for one night. Front Desk service was a bit slow because of lack of sufficient help. This may be because the Intercontinental is opening a brand new, very large hotel soon next to the Austin Convention center. The rest of the my experience was very good. The Staff is VERY friendly and eager to please."
2,Book for Location & Nothing Else,"The location is great. Everything else falls VERY short of expectations. Particularly cleanliness. Not only was our room not clean upon check-in, but it was never cleaned during our stay. Very disappointed."
5,Quick Trip with a great night of sleep,"I was o my at the hotel one night, but it was the best sleep I’d had in a while. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was nice and quiet. I had been upgraded to the 15th floor upon check in. The front desk staff was very friendly, and made sure I had my rewards number for WiFi. Valet service was quick and friendly."
4,Quick trip,"The valets were efficient and friendlier than the desk staff. Check in was less than smooth. However, there was a very nice, courteous woman manning the front desk at check out. No major issues. Remember to read all the signs in the elevators, because the staff won't tell you to scan your room key for floor access."
5,Perfect,The staff was warm and welcoming from valet to front desk and breakfast the next morning. Lovely hotel. Particularly enjoyed the club facilities. The selection of food and beverage at happy hour was most generous and inviting. And breakfast service in the same room was terrific. Coffee was great!
3,Wifi like it's 1999,"Our room was fine, as was the hotel's location. We hadn't had time to look at best self-parking options so chose valet, which felt expensive (but it is a central location). I really did not appreciate having to pay for wifi though (it's only free for members) - come on people, it's 2018! I don't know if it was $10 or $15 (my husband paid that as I was fuming) and even then you only get to connect three devices. Not ok!"
4,"Prime location, on par with the global IHC city hotels (Prague, SFO etc)","Location is prime, walking distance to everything (SXSW, Capitol Factory, Convention Center etc). Old pre-war beautiful architecture throughout. rooms are very well attired and equipped. Reminds me of the Hotel Bethlehem. The lobby has great sitting areas to talk and have a drink. The ground level bar is hopping with attentive staff. Entire experience is consistently as good as other major city IHC Hotels."
5,Great hotel in the center of Austin,"The Stephen F. Austin was a luxurious hotel, with those great features of a big hotel but the service and attention of a boutique spot. Rooms were spacious and well appointed, catering and staff were wonderful and it is convenient to everything you would choose to do in Austin. Concierge was skilled and enthusiastic and went the extra mile. The meeting space was quite elegant with outdoor balconies everywhere. I would definitely return to this hotel."
1,beware of cancellation policy,"I made the reservation about 12 hours before arriving, thinking that the convention I was attending was located at the hotel. It turned out that there was only a convention dinner there, and the actual site was across town. IHG and the hotel manager will not allow any flexibility on the cancellation policy, even if the reservation was just made. You've bought the room if it's within 24 hours. I'll stick with Hilton and Hyatt properties in the future -- last time at an IHG property."
5,April Road Trip,Held 3-day business meeting. 50 participants. Meeting areas were great. Event staff very professional.Food service too. Restaraunt food great.Guest rooms small but nice. Would have liked mini bar.Friendly staff overall.
4,A bit dated,"Great location, old school used amenities in neighborhood vs.at hotel. I was disappointed that there was no free wireless in the room. The size of room was much appreciated vs. some of the shoebox sized rooms at the competition."
4,Nice Room,"Stayed here on a business trip and the room was very nice. The room service was slow, but they apologized and didn't charge for my dinner. You can only valet park here and I had to circle the building twice to figure out how to get to the valet area. Valet is also very slow in the morning (both valet issues are why I gave a 4 instead of a 5).They had a lot of chargers in the room and the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again in the future."
2,I do not recommend this hotel.,"When we booked this hotel, we were told we could pay for an upgrade upon check-in. When we arrived, the desk person told us we were not allowed to upgrade. This room is so small that there isn't enough room to sit other than in the bed. When we asked to use a microwave, we were advised that microwaves are not allowed in the room and guests are not allowed to use the hotel microwave. I called the desk to see if there are restaurants that deliver and the desk guy had to ask someone else. The only good thing is that the beds, albeit small, are comfortable. I do not recommend this hotel."
5,Great weekend,"Get away weekend, hotel and staff were awesome,room was super clean, i woild recomend this hotel to everyone, I loved the furniture,bed was very comfortable,thank you. I will for sure stay here on my next trip to Austin."
4,Great Location Except the Parking,This is a great rehabbed hotel in the heart of downtown. The room was well-appointed and comfortable. A little more classy than your typical chain hotel. The only downside was parking: $45 a night for valet and there is minimal parking available offsite.
4,Noisy street,"The hotel across the street played outdoor music all night long, which made for a sleepless night. The room was nice. There were not conveniet electrical outlets, the staff was very professional and accommodating."
5,We will always stay here when in Austin,"Great location, close to everything! Great amenities and attentive service. Rooms are all nicely appointed. And the bar/restaurant with terrace overlooking Congress so you can spend time to relax and people-watch."
5,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a beautiful property in a very convenient, downtown Austin location, steps away from the action on 6th Street and excellent, quieter restaurants as well. The room was very spacious and well-appointed. Just a few quirks with respect to the bathroom and the television."
5,"Stayed one night, wanted to stay a week!","My company had their annual Sales Meeting coming up, and we wanted to do it in Austin due to all of our Sales people being spread around Texas. The only city we didn't really have people was in Austin. So, we went searching, price shopping and the best deal for a wonderful and luxurious hotel was the InterContinental SFA. The staff helped us book rooms, a meeting space and we even ordered breakfast for our meeting.We were there for one night only, but we wanted to stay longer. We had a great time and the hotel was wonderful! The staff was very accommodating and the location was perfect for us! We will most likely come back for our next Annual Meeting."
5,Easter Weekend Stay,My business trip was a quiet and pleasing stay at the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin. The benefits of being an InterContinental Ambassador truly pay off. I requested a 4:00 PM checkout and the staff accomadated my request without any issues.
5,Our wedding night,We arrived at the hotel after midnight and we were worn out. We were greeted with a smile and great customer service. Then they had our bags brought to the room not five minutes after we arrived. In addition they were so kind to upgrade us to a suite because it was our wedding night.
4,Tesla friendly,"The TV technology is as bad as the toilet paper. Plan on building extra time into your schedule if you like to change channels. The staff is exquisite, with the front desk proving a welcome Lone Star beer. Windows dirty, views south suck. When you spend $400 on a room you expect more. They are one of the few hotels with a Tesla charging station. But next visit I’ll move up a star and go to The Mansion which is also Tesla friendly."
5,"Nice downtown hotel, great food",I was there for 2 days for a meeting. The lunch buffets they provided were excellent - great variety and taste. Breakfast was more basic but still good.Check-in took a while - not that there was a line but the computer must have been sluggish. My room was nice with extra touches such as a bathrobe and slippers. The mattress was a little too firm and pillows too soft for my tastes. The TV had lots of channels except MSNBC wouldn't come in - it said weak signal. Then I remembered I was in Texas. One night there was loud music coming from a bar a block or two away which can keep light sleepers awake. The next night it was quieter.The lobby has some comfortable furniture if you want to hang out. Be a little cautious walking around. In both daytime and nighttime there were aggressive panhandlers and sketchy characters.
5,Elegance in the heart of Austin,Amazing customer service - Texan hospitality at it's best! The room was beautifully appointed with tasteful decor and with beautiful fragrant soap and hand lotion. The staff also accommodated special requests and helped this Australian traveller navigate tipping etiquette.
4,Great location but can be noisy on the weekend...,"Stayed at the Intercontinental recently with my family. It is a historic hotel in a very central location in Downtown Austin. The lobby is beautiful and there is nice bar/restaurant on the 2nd floor with an outdoor seating area. Hotel staff was friendly. Our room was clean and spacious. We stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night. Our only complaint with the hotel is there is are a few nightclubs nearby and on the Saturday night, even with windows shut, we could hear music until 4am making it difficult to sleep. Sunday night was much more quiet. Overall we had a good stay."
5,Excellent Customer Service,"My fiancé and I are IHG members and often stay at interContinental. We opted to use some of our points for our stay in Austin. We were misinformed about our payment methods while booking with IHG, and the hotel was extremely helpful and worked with us and contacted IHG to resolve our problem. William Binford, the rooms director at the hotel, and his staff were professional and helpful in resolving our issues to make sure we were happy with our experience at their hotel.This review is mainly for the hotel to see (as they have no review section or customer service email listed on their website) and can recognize Mr. Binford for his dedication to their facility and its customers."
5,Stunning hotel,"The rooms, the hotel and the 2nd floor restaurant/ bar was absolutely stunning. Loved the location of the hotel and the staff was absolutely kind and accommodating. I will definitely recommend to others"
5,Great location and A++ service!,"My husband and I spent two nights here the first weekend in March 2018. The on-site bar and restaurant are excellent, the rooms are fairly spacious for an historic property and well-furnished and designed. We were celebrating our anniversary during this visit and when we came back the room after dinner on our first night, we happily discovered that the concierge had placed a champagne bottle and service for two along with a personally written congratulatory card in our room. Such a lovely touch! Thank you, Eleni Varnavas."
5,Great Property!,"Great location, great property, great staff. This hotel lives up to the expectations of the InterContinental brand. We highly recommend this hotel. Our trip was focused on a wedding event and the staff was very accomodating."
5,Awesome Hotel,"This is an exceptionaly nice hotel with great service and very friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to great restaurants and shopping and if I ever travel to Austin again, i will most definately stay here."
5,Top Notch Business Stay,"I stayed here for a week during travel to Austin for a conference. All of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The Continental Club was excellent for breakfast, mid afternoon snacks and evening drinks. The only parking on site is valet, and they would have the car up very quickly. Would definitely stay again!"
2,Nice staff lousy rooms.,"Great staff especially the breakfast waitress, Veronica. We asked for a quiet room and got a very small room next to the outside air conditioners that were especailly loud. Great location and nice beds."
5,21st Birthday,"We stayed at the hotel for our son's 21st so we would be within walking distance of 6th St and other fun places to celebrate. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful whenever we needed anything. The rooms were attractive, comfortable, and clean, and the place felt safe and secure. I would happily use this hotel for future visits involving the downtown area of Austin."
5,Seamlessly Good Experience,"Nothing negative to say here at all. Staff were very friendly, room was luxurious yet functional, and you can't beat the location. Parking is expensive, but you're in the middle of a city center, so no judgement there. Best wifi I've ever experienced in a hotel - almost better than home. Great job!"
5,Fantastic!,Great property close to 6th street. Booked a conference here and they went above and beyond. Beds are extremely comfortable and room was luxurious and spacious. Check in was incredible and they got me into my room by noon!
5,Downtown Austin class,"We love staying here. Outstanding service and atmosphere. Very convenient to get in and out. Even when the front desk and valet are overwhelmed, they always serve everyone quickly and with a smile giving us no reason not to come back!"
4,Great Location,"Hotel is perfect location, center of city. Hotel balcony bar is a great spot to hang out. Rooms are a bit small but it is downtown so that's expected. Rooms were clean and quiet. Would stay here again if back in Austin for sure."
4,Busy location,The hotel staff was great. It was our first time in Austin. Its a great town and the hotel was in a great location for walking to almost all local “must sees”. I would recommend this hotel for the convenience and nice attitude of the staff.
4,Nice Stay,"The room was very well appointed and clean. I really enjoyed having a sit down vanity in the bathroom. It was a great convenience and added an upscale feel to the room. I also liked the bedside touch panel that controlled the lights and thermostat. I did not care for the adjoining door to the next room though, and I wish I had been informed at check-in. As a female traveling alone, I would have requested a non-adjoining room. Check-in process was a bit slow due to the EMV chip credit card reader (beyond anyone's control), but most of the staff was very helpful and courteous. I would definitely stay there again!"
5,This place is my favorite; great staff!,"I visited the Terrace Bar several times during SXSW last week for a meal and drink away from the madness, and Brandy, Robin, and Evan stand out as taking great care of me each time they were on duty. Always friendly and attentive, they were a big reason that I spent $300-400 in the bar last week. This isn't unusual though - I live and work in Austin and come back to see them again and again because of the service they provide (and those brisket quesadillas!). I love this bar and love to bring my friends in. It's also become a pre- and post-show tradition whenever we see shows at the Paramount. Thank you all for welcoming me, and I'll see you soon!"
4,SXSW Stephen F. Austin Intercontinental,"Not a prude but did not appreciate smelling marijuana in the hotel lobby, hallways and elevators throughout the weekend. Should have had a little more security throughout the hotel. Otherwise, the hotel continues to be a go-to for my household."
5,Great Stay,"Great place to stay from the moment you walk in until you checkout. We will stay there every time we are in Austin. Our view was Excellent and the room was very clean, the bed was comfortable. We had room service and the food was hot when it arrived and came in a timely manner."
5,Upscale in all ways!,"From making our reservations to check out day, our IC Austin texas was phenomenal! The management and staff made our SXSW trip so comfortable and fun! Thank you to Ali, Eric, Andrew & Donna, what a great staff! The valet and bell staff were awesome too! Will definitely come back!"
5,Sweet location spacious room nice amenities,"Right at the end of dirty 6th, this IHG hotel is perfect for those wanting to be close to all the action, but have a nice clean refined place to retire for the night.The basic rooms have a bunch of extra in terms of toiletries, charging cables, fridge space, and a beside light control.I loved my stay here you will too."
5,Great place to stay in Austin.,"Always enjoy the Intercontinental. The balcony is also fun in the summer, great gym in the basement and centrally located if you want to pop around town. The rooms are large and set up very nicely. I travel regularly and tend to rate hotels on how well I sleep. Generally Intercontinental has gotten very high marks from me for for the following: Nice mattresses, Nice Pillows, and more covers than you get at some hotels. I hate flat pillows hard mattresses and having just a thin top sheet. If you are a person like me that enjoys sleeping at home with more covers and lower temps, it's hard to adjust to that set up."
4,Great service and location,"We had been staying in Austin over New Years for a wedding and decided to stay a bit longer than the rest of our party. We booked a night at the Intercontinental. The location is great. Walking distance to 6th Street, State Capitol, and most of the downtown business district locations. We arrived early and they kept our bags while our room was getting ready and we explored downtown a bit. The room didn't take long to become available from when we first checked in. We went up to our room and they brought our bags up from storage for us. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size. We did have some issues with water coming out under the toilet but we told the hotel upon checkout. We didn't spend a lot of time there, but we enjoyed our stay."
4,Walking distance to Austin City Limits,"The location is perfect for many downtown venues, including easy walking distance to Austin City Limits, only five blocks away. The employees here are very attentive to providing a great customer experience."
5,Jeremy Carr-great service!,"Great service in the club lounge! Our server, Jeremy Carr, was very uplifting. He was nice and considerate, and even gave us some insight on the city that was very helpful. He was also very patient. The club lounge is a great place to hang out and relax."
4,"Excellent Location, Close to the Capitol","We recently wanted to re-visit the beautiful, historic Capitol in Austin. We have stayed at the Four Seasons, the Driscoll and the ATT Conference Center on the UT campus. All have been good but wanted the closest location to the Capitol building - easy walking distance. The Stephen F Austin fit the bill.The hotel is an historic building although not as old as the Driscoll. It is only three blocks from both the Capitol and the Governor's mansion.The hotel is in pretty nice shape but did have two drawbacks. We checked in after three pm on a Sunday but our room was not ready - we reserved a one bedroom suite.We were a bit road weary but since we had the Intercontinental club privileges, not a problem. However, we were told it would only be a short wait and someone would come get us when the room was finally ready.We waited almost thirty minutes and no one came. When we went back to check the young lady who checked us in was gone. The young man who had replaced her apparently was not told about our situation. If we hadn't checked, we might still be waiting. Very bad form and certainly not five star service.Also note there is not a hotel restaurant in this location but you can pay a fee to use the Intercontinental club for breakfast. That is the group who run the hotel.There is a restaurant attached to the hotel, a chain called Roaring Fork, but they only serve lunch and dinner.Our one bed room suite was well appointed and had lots of room with a good view of the Capitol and even the Tower at UT.Room service is somewhat limited but the food is pretty good with nice service.All in all an almost four star stay but the front desk check in needs some improvement and the lack of a true hotel restaurant may be off-putting to some. But you cannot beat the location if you have plans to visit or business at the Capitol."
4,Girls' Weekend,I headed back to the Stephen F. Austin for a ladies' weekend. We opted for a suite with Club access so we could enjoy the breakfast and espressos in the morning and opt for drinks in the evening before heading out to dinner. The staff was very friendly and accommodating!Our suite was at the very end of a long hallway which was ideal for us sleeping late in the mornings if we needed.
3,a very generous 3,"first time I have ever stayed in this intercontinental. I have stayed at many around the world. This one needs total rehab. Old and tired, and asking top dollar. the public areas are ok, and the staff is nice and helpful. The rooms look recently rehabbed, but done in a total cheap fashion. We are talking about lower than Home Depot on sale fixtures. The in room amenities are the cheapest possible and my room was dirty. Looking at the window Fram outside my window, there was only peeling paint. Also Austin is a tech capital. I will be back for SXSW in a couple of weeks. I hate having to get down on my hands and knees to plug my phone and computers in. Glad I am staying at aloft across the street- a modern hotel."
4,"Great location, beautiful hotel","This hotel was in a perfect location for what we wanted to see and do in Austin. It is a beautiful, clean hotel. One downside is that they only offer valet parking, which costs $43/night. I know you can find cheaper parking nearby though so I wouldn’t let that stop us from staying there again. Also, because of the location, it’s a little noisy late in to the night, just something to consider if that could be a problem for you."
4,"Great location at 7th and Congress, staff well intentioned","Walking distance to the Capitol, LBJ library, the Driskill and other historic down sites. The room was spacious and very nice, housekeeping was noticeably good. We thought the breakfast restaurant, while certainly adequate, was not of the same caliber as the rest of the accommodations."
5,Great hotel,"Reception desk gave great service, very professional and prompt. Valet is excellent. Professional, prompt and friendly. This hotel is a great location. Walking distance to great food, entertainment and business. Highly recommend."
5,Great location,"Friendly staff, great location, nice adjoining restaurant with a great happy hour, quiet comfortable room. We also enjoyed the free wine hour and travel tips from staff. We recommend this place to others, particularly couples, solos, or for business."
5,A jewel in downtown Austin,"The 94- years old hotel locates on Congress Ave within walking distance to the Texas Capitol. Classically designed with modernly equipped, and what made my stay extraordinary are the people- a shoutout to Vineet in the Club, Alex and Ashley at frontdesk."
5,Great Hotel,Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Eleni was great at concierge desk! Local restaurants know Eleni and take care of the guests she sends them. Hotel is well located downtown with easy walk to Capital and great restaurants.
5,Great location and beautiful hotel!,Location was perfect. Everything was within walking distance. Bed and views were amazing. Staff was extremely professional and went out of their way to make sure our stay was great. Such a charming hotel. I can’t wait to come back again!
4,Great hotel!,The room was small but well appointed. I love the bath products provided. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The location of the hotel makes it easy to get to the State Capitol as well as many restaurants. I would stay here again.
5,Perfect Location Downtown,"We had a Kind Suite...it was perfect...had view of the Capitol at night from our couch...Perfect location walking distance to Capitol...St Marys Church...downtown 6th street...Stroll to any of the many restaurants near by...AND walk across the street to the Driskill Hotel.. where ""the 1886 Cafe"" is located...also it has nice bar & grill for a night drink while listening to live music...or just pass thru the hotel for a visit of this Wonderful Land Mark...be sure and see the glass doors to the 1886 Cafe."
5,Will is awesome!,I have yet to actually step into this hotel but I can say the customer service is excellent! I needed to change my reservation and Will went above and beyond to make sure my request was honored! Thanks!
4,Satisfied overall,The room was nice and has a traditional decor to it. A lot of amenities that typically isn’t found in other hotels like umbrellas are available. But something basic like water was missed out. I didn’t see a fridge or microwave either. But on the plus side. Room was spacious. Valet and staff were super nice and responsive. Location can’t be beat. I wanted dinner and so many choices nearby. I headed to elevate nearby which has a great whisky collection and burgers etc.
5,Nice Historic Hotel,"Very nice, historic property in the heart of downtown Austin. Rooms are small but very comfortable and nicely appointed.Be sure to check out the second floor bar. Really beautiful.Check-in process was very slow with a large backlog of people waiting for rooms. Perhaps they should change check-out time from noon to 11a to give the cleaning staff more time.Otherwise highly recommended."
4,Pretty nice,"Nice property, friendly service, great gym, a few flaws with the rooms. Specifically, the first room I had was very dark and in the second, the toilet stopped working. But the lobby is lovely as is the coffee and water availability, the bed was comfortable, and the entire staff was awesome. Also, the location couldn’t be beat."
4,Nice Hotel but Needs Updating,"Overall, the staff was very kind and attentive. However, a couple of things were frustrating enough that I would not stay there again. The lack of outlets to plug in electronic devices was a big disappointment. The outlets near the bed and desk were all being used by the lamps and clocks. In today’s environment this is essential. Also, the fitness center, while big, has very dated equipment. The cardio equipment was fine, except for the lack of a spin bike. However, the free weights and weight machines were very old and not as good. The stretching mats also need replacing. Overall, the hotel is kinda dark, but that would be okay, if everything else was addressed."
5,Austin weekend,"Great hotel. Friendly, accommodating staff from door porters to front desk and concierge to restaurant and bar staff. Clean, well-appointed room cleaned promptly after leaving each day. Lovely terrace bar off second floor. Very centrally located."
5,Exceptional Hotel Experience,We stayed here for two days after our wedding. Very efficient check-in and check out process. Beautiful and spacious room. Kind and thoughtful staff. They even surprised us with chilled champagne and chocolates.
4,Perfectly Located,"This hotel not only was top notch but very conveniently located to walk just about anywhere in town! Fresh cold water in the very beautiful yet comfortable entry, our group pulled up some seats and had ou Voo Doo Donuts while enjoying some Olympic coverage. Sunday mornings you can imbued in a mimosa or Bloody Mary right in the lobby!The rooms are not huge but ample and very nicely put together. Keurig in the room with 6 choices of coffees or teas. Mini bar available to purchase items.Gum, hot tub available. Bar Grill with outside area overlook Congress St. A Restaurant is also on the premises"
4,Good hotel with a great location,"The hotel is a good place. The lobby is spacious and the check in was easy when we stayed. There was no line. The room was ok, I didn't know we would get a queen bed instead of a king but other than that the room was fine. The bathroom is slightly tight with a bath shower which I find a bit old fashioned but everything was clean. I would stay again I just think that $40 a night for valet is just way too damn expensive. This isn't New York, there's no need for this kind of price."
5,Just an amazing Hotel..,"I cant say enough about the Intercontinental Stephen Austin. I love the archetecture that blended the orginal with contemporary touches. Just an amazing place. I even love the wall paper that sourounded the elevator entries, amazing, actually not enough space in this review to share all of my thoughts. Service in all aspects was extraordinary, food in the club level was amazing. Restaurants and bar on the property were fantastic, overall well located property in the heart of downtown."
5,Best place to stay in Austin,"I travel over 10,000 miles per month for work, so I’m pretty opinionated about hotels. The Intercontinental in Austin is one of my favorite hotels in the country. Not only do they have one of the best locations in Austin, they have the absolute best staff. The room quality is first class and the site is great for business meetings. Will continue to keep this hotel as my first choice in Austin."
4,Location - Staff - Quality,THE GOOD- central location- excellent restaurant- comfortable bed and bath- modern exercise facility- nice swimming pool albeit smallTHE BAD-bath was small-windows need cleaning-limited viewsTHE UGLY- nothing ugly
5,Great staff and location,"The staff from the street to the desk were very friendly and helpful. You cannot beat the Congress Avenue location. It is right in the middle of the shops, restaurants and bars. It is also directly across the street from the Contemporary Austin art museum."
5,"Prime location, impeccable service","We were so impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff. Our stay was excellent. This hotel is different than what we typically choose as far as decor but we really enjoyed it. The rooms are a little small but bed was extremely comfortable and staff/service makes up for what is lacking in space. They have full size cribs, too."
5,"Great hotel downtown Austin, easy to get everywhere!","We were in town for a conference at the convention center. It's about 7-8 blocks from there. Which in nice weather is not a big deal, unfortunately, it was cold while we were in town. It was still pretty easy to get around, Austin has a company called electric cab that will come to the hotel to get you for FREE...we also used Fasten and Uber. The hotel itself was very nice, the room I had was nice and roomy. My colleague's room was EXTREMELY small. So make sure you ask for a room that has space in it."
5,Wedding Weekend Perfection,"For our daughter's wedding, the hotel was our ""headquarters"" for wedding party and families and many guests. We worked with Justin Malone to make all arrangements and he and all of the staff were attentive and first-rate. All of our out of town guests enjoyed their rooms and the service and found the block rate to be very affordable.Highly recommended!"
4,Stephen Fs Terrace Bar Offers Great Outside Seating,We visited the Stephen F's Terrace Bar on the second floor. It had fast service and a great elevated view of downtown Austin with comfortable seating. Both food and drinks are available. A short walk to the capitol.
5,Teradata meeting,"Your rooms were very comfortable, front desk very friendly, meeting room was very nice, food was great, service impeccable and Jeanine did a great job helping me put this meeting together. I appreciate all your staff did to make this meeting a success. Thank you"
3,Average at Best,"Hotel staff was great. Hotel... Not so much. Nice, but a tiny room. Outlets near one side of the bed did not work, could hear the trash chute and everything else in the hallways, tight tiny bathroom, shower selector missing. Parking was $40+. Last minute pick, wish we would have opted for another property."
5,Had a lovely time!,"Great service, friendly and helpful staff, and lovely rooms. Conveniently located near everything I needed for my stay. Check-in and check-out were a breeze and all the staff seemed genuinely happy to help make my stay a pleasant one."
4,"Great location and room, so so service","Rooms were decent size, very clean and thoughtfully appointed. Information cards around the room explained how technology worked, etc - a nice touch. Room service was iffy at best. Food was lackluster and quite disappointing. Pretty hard to mess up scrambled eggs but they managed to do so. Housekeeping was worse. Front desk staff and bellhops very attentive, although I found it odd that the staff was unable to answer basic questions like decent lunch spot recommendations, especially in a high tourist area. Hotel has definitely improved from my previous stay though."
5,"Big, busy, town center hotel","Stayed two nights, the Saturday night was very busy, Sunday less so. Staff were great, the steak excellent. Ideal central location, easy to walk to 6th Street, Rainey Street and the Capitol. Would definitely use again."
5,Surprise Engagement - Pulled off Perfectly!!,"I wanted to pull off a surprise engagement to my girlfriend. I wanted it to be special, memorable and a BIG surprise. Ricky and his staff were able to help pull this off perfectly without a hitch. The thing that meant the most during the planning and execution of this event was the true excitement that Ricky and his staff shared on helping make this a magical experience. They went above and beyond to make sure that every detail was addressed and carried out flawlessly. From getting a special table reserved, to helping the rest of our party (over 20 ppl) hide in a ballroom to keep the surprise, to preparing drinks to serve as we walked in, to pouring the champagne toast AND they timed everything perfectly!! I could not have pulled this off without the professionalism, passion and attention to detail displayed by everyone at the SFA Bar! Thank you to Ricky and his amazing team! If I ever need a special event planned again, there is no doubt that I would call on Ricky and James and their team. Highly recommend!"
5,Yes,The Hotel was so beautiful and convient....i love Ashley....so made our stay worthy of a rebooking......The hotel had a wonderful breakfast with a bar.......Right in the heart of 6th street....I really love this Hotel...
5,Excellent!,Nice central location. Great property. Very quiet & comfy bed. Large rooms. The bar had a good vibe. The hotel staff was friendly and willing to help out with anything. I felt like I was on vacation instead of a business trip.
5,Great stay in a charming true texan hotel,"Loved the ambiance and appreciated the hospitable warm texas service, The hotel has an old world charm of its own which we loved and were sorry to leave, we would happily recomend this hotel and most definitely we will be back"
5,Was breakfast included?,"Room was very clean. Had everything we needed and close to our daughter's home. Price seemed high and we were told breakfast was included, but when we ate, we were given a bill, mentioned to front desk and they offered a free breakfast next day, but we had to leave and couldn't use it. Make sure you ask when you check in"
5,Exceptional Staff!,"My wife and I stayed at the Stephen F Austin Intercontinental for an anniversary recently and were pleasantly surprised at how kind every member of the staff was! Within an hour of arriving, a bottle of champagne was brought to our door with raspberries and truffles to congratulate us on our anniversary! I also kindly asked if instead of champagne we could have a bottle of the wine on the cart since neither of us likes champagne and without hesitation he said absolutely! The room was nice and staff was accommodating throughout!"
5,Love the Stephen F. Austin,"I travel to Austin quite a bit and have never been disappointed with my stays. The location is fabulous, the staff is top notch and the hotel is fabulous! I love the bar on the second floor (especially during the summer sitting on the balcony) plus the access to the Roaring Fork is great. The beds are so comfortable and the rooms are the perfect size! Love this hotel!"
5,Great stay in Austin,"Reception staff was friendly and quick--I love that. Room was clean and very comfortable. I'm an early riser, and so having coffee in the lobby at 4:30am, is a real convenience. Great hotels think about little things like this--it's a big thing to me. Overall great stay!"
5,I'd come again!!!,"The staff were exceptionally helpful, friendly, and professional. The room was clean and updated. My grandchild loved the pool and hot tub. We ate breakfast in the dining room and found everything delicious and well prepared. The conceirge was knowledgeable about restaruants and places of interest."
5,Special wedding weekend,"The staff, service, atmosphere and location made my daughter's wedding weekend a truly special weekend! All of our guests were treated like VIPS and no request went unfilled or questioned. Justine Malone did a fantastic job organizing and coordinating the rooms for our group, the transportation for our trips and ensuring each guest got a gift bag at check in."
5,WOW!,The staff makes this hotel stand out from the rest! If you're planning an event/meeting ask for Julie Stanfield & Rachel MAllister. They will make what many tell you impossible... possible! Service is Top Notch! Nate Walker in charge of AV went above & beyond to make certain our meeting presentations ran smoothly. I was blown away by the sales department & truly appreciated their eye for detail. Thank you!!!
4,Nice Hotel,"A nice hotel, but the rooms can be pricey. Decent rooms but you can tell this is an older hotel. We enjoyed the on-site restaurant for happy hours. Location is fantastic, right off 6th street and Congress. We were in walking distance to everything."
5,Great Hotel,Great location. Came to town for a couple of concerts at Austin City Limits. Nice few block walk. Beds are very comfortable. Check in went smooth. Would definitely book again. Thank You for a relaxing weekend.
5,AH-MAZING!,"Before we arrived until after we left, the staff went above and beyond to make our stay FABULOUS! I cannot say enough good about EVERY aspect of our time there. The location is ideal...downtown Austin/Capitol Building/restaurants (not that you need to go any further than the Rolling Fork), nightlife...all right there. Our room was perfect...very comfortable bed, shower had excellent water pressure with lots of hot water. When I did call housekeeping, I swear they must have right down the hall because it seemed like only a minute or two and they were at the door. Thank you for a wonderful weekend!!!"
3,Be sure and understand your charges,"The hotel was lovely and the room was nice, though a bit small. Be sure and understand the billing, as I was unclear as to what I was being charged for at the time of check in. I booked with an aggregate service and had to verify the charges were correct. Also, I thought their valet parking fee of $40/day was excessive. There isn't a store in the event you need something. They do have a few complimentary items such as a toothbrush. Be sure and eat at the restaurant! It was great!"
5,Great Stay,"Had a great stay; staff was extremely friendly, room was great size and appealing, everything pertaining to room and board was convenient, food was well prepared; appreciated the amenities; would come back again"
5,Excellent stay,"Excellent hotel, perfect location,it is just a walk away from all the night life on 6th street, the hotel.is beautiful, staff attentive, the king room is suoer big, the bed really comfortable, everything is just great at Intercontinental Stephen Austin."
5,Samantha Smith,The service was excellent at this property! Everyone was so helpful and the room was wonderful. Easy check in/ check out process. I look forward to my return to Austin. I will definitely be staying here again.
5,"Location, Location, Location!","Perfect location. Great staff. Close to everything. Hot coffee waiting for you in the lobby every morning. 2 restaurants. Music on Wednesday night. We walked to museums, UofT, SoCo. When you reserve your hotel spring for the breakfast, it’s great. Beds are comfy. Chocolates on the pillow every night. Concierge is there daily and is helpful Shower is easy to operate and plenty of hot water. Only “concern” is their heat system, it is loud. Sounds like a rocket taking off."
5,Great,Very nice hotel and I will stay there again!! Room service was great. The location is in a ideal spot and events are in walking distance. The restaurant in the hotel is top notch. We enjoyed the gym and pool area. A most stay!!
5,great hotel,very nice hotel..They have a good club room..Had a very pleasant conversation with Kate the IT person at the hotel..She was very helpful & made our visit even more enjoyable..Not far from statehouse ..
2,Five Star Rate for a Two to Three Star Hotel,Room service - my order was not as expected. There was an overcharge that did not get corrected.The coffee machine did not work.The food was definitely not five star.$40.00 per day parking fee...unreasonable!
5,Excellent Experience,"Stayed here for our anniversary night. It was very nice. The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The staff was very helpful with our concerns. Our room was right off the elevator on the 15th floor, but there was no noise to be heard in the room the entire night...on NYE nonetheless. Highly recommend this property."
4,Great hotel close to the Capitol,"The hotel had a great atmosphere-historic in nature. The hotel is on Congress Avenue and is just a few blocks from the Capitol and across the street from the Driskill hotel. Requested handicapped room and was given a room, two rooms down from the elevator with a walk in shower. The room had one queen size bed. The side tables and the desk had clearly marked, easily accessible, electric outlets. The bathroom had a night light and both bar soap and body wash. There was also convenient side table next to the sink which contained cotton pads q-tips and other free amenities. Room had a coffee/tea bar and free ice on each floor. Overall I was very pleased with the room and its location until I checked out and received a bill for $40.00+ for valet parking. I would stay here again."
4,As expected,"We only spent one night in a standard king room, but everything was as expected for a hotel of this level. We especially loved the second floor terrace/bar, the bartender was right on with his choice of cocktail."
5,What a beautiful hotel,"My husband and I brought our kids down for the weekend. It was wonderful! The pool was fun for the kids, we enjoyed the bar on the 2nd floor, and the restaurant was so good! Very central location and a beautiful view of the capital. We can't wait to come back!"
5,Wonderful Stay in Austin,"Beautiful historic hotel in an outstanding location, center of downtown Austin. Within walking distance of the state capitol building, 6th street and many great restaurants and night life. Our room was spacious and included a sofa bed. The bathroom was large, clean and included some extras like a sewing kit.The staff was professional and attentive. I would like to make mention specifically of Mike Crane, who assisted pre-arrival and Justin Baugh, who help us with dinner reservations. If I find myself in Austin again, I would definitely return to the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin."
5,Helpful Engagement,I had reached out to the hotel the day before our trip to Austin and was assisted by Justin Baugh who is a front office manager there. He helped me arrange flowers that I wanted placed in the room at a specific time as I was proposing to my now fiancé on our trip but was trying my best to keep it a surprise. Justin followed through my requests perfectly and added to my order and reservation without question. Thank you for everything you all did and it really was an amazing time.
3,"Great location, dated but spacious rooms, inconsistent service","Recently stayed here over a holiday weekend. Upon arrival, Platinum Ambassador status was recognized and was offered an amenity. Chose the drink. The room was a deluxe room, and it was a large, spacious room, however it was a bit dated. Noise insulation was poor, with it being right near the ice machine. We could hear conversations in the neighbor's rooms and the room above us moving around.We needed just a handful of routine things from the front desk and the service varied from adequate and cordial to dismissive and we were made to feel like we were being a bother, even though our questions were mainly about getting a shaving kit or some other small thing. It was a shame for 5 star hotel. Have had much, MUCH better and consistent service at other hotels.The grounds are beautiful, although 6th St. is losing a bit of its magic as of late. This is no fault of the hotel. Common areas were beautifully decorated for the holidays and the lobby is welcoming and luxurious.All in all, I have to review this hotel against hotels in its peer group, meaning mid-tier luxury hotels and other high end hotels in the IHG group and this hotel ranks in the low to middle category. It has a decent location, at times good service, and large well-appointed rooms. It also has a consistency problem, some internal noise issues, a dated feel, and there are newer hotels in more desirable areas. The decision for many will come down to cost and status. If it makes sense for you, you could do much worse than the IC SFA, but if you want to experience the best in Austin, look elsewhere."
4,All-around good but nothing special,"We booked this hotel for a family trip due to its central location and indoor pool. Everything was good - comfortable beds, spacious rooms, good workout facility, nice breakfast menu, helpful staff (though maid service was not a strong point - the pool area was dirty and we rarely had anyone come back to clean the room when we had DND sign on in morning), easy to get car in and out (though valet service was spendy). Would recommend it!"
4,Classic charm with a nice downtown location,"We stayed at the intercontinental during the holidays. It is in downtown austin and well situated close to 6th street and all the great bars and restaurants.There is a very small salt water pool and hot tub in the basement. It’s surprisingly small (basically the size of one lap lane) but the salt water makes it very pleasant. And it was clean.Our room was upgraded to a king and much more spacious than expected, especially for a historic downtown hotel.Standard checkout was noon and they let us do a later checkout.The main negative was the parking situation. The hotel offers valet for $40 a night and there really isn’t a better option. Street parking requires feeding the meter every 3 hours and you need to pay until midnight. The cheapest parking lots in the area are $30 a night but you can’t take the car out once you park without being charged more (like if you want to drive to dinner ) so we ended up doing valet for the flexibility.Other than the costly parking it was a great hotel and a nice getaway."
5,Enjoyable Christmas Stay!,"We loved the hotel, our room, the location, the staff. We ate at the Roaring Fork restaurant in the hotel one night for dinner and it was great. The room was a King Deluxe I believe and it was very roomy and felt very luxurious. The staff was great. Housekeeping came around at night to see if you needed towels, and to offer chocolates, ice, or any other needs. Location in downtown Austin is great and right in the middle of everything - walking distance to the state capitol building and many great restaurants, night life, movie theaters! Excellent!"
5,Treat yourself!,"This hotel had it all. The beauty of past glory that had been updated to include all the tech world has to offer. The design down to the artwork gives a feeling of nostalgia with class. With service and food to match the quality of the design, you have, simply put, perfection."
5,Perfect!,Often when I travel I find the photos of the hotels create an unrealistic picture of the actual rooms. Generally they photograph the penthouse or something and your room never compares. This was totally not the case with the Intercontinental Austin. The room was exactly as pictured. It was big and spacious with a great view. It felt very elegant in a classic way.Restaurant on site was great and had very attentive bar and restaurant staff.Check in staff were friendly and helpful.We were hoping for a late check out at 1pm (normal is 12pm which is great!) and they accommodated.Location was wonderful.Would definitely stay again and was very pleasantly surprised.
5,Amazing stay,I recently stayed at this amazing hotel located just perfect in downtown area making your stay comfortable and memorable. The hotel is clean and provides u great hospitality. The staffs were very helpful. You won’t regret it.
5,Excellent,"Great hotel, outstanding location and attentive, professional staff. Located I. The center of downtown, this beautiful historic hotel is everything you want for a fun trip to Austin. We had a bridal party in a suite next to ours - they were loud and we didn’t get much sleep during our first night there. I mentioned it to the hotel staff the next morning and they were very accommodating by offering us a different room.The city is fantastic: great sightseeing, parks and food!"
5,Very good property,"As a Royal Ambassador, I have been well taken care of, although compare to IC Hotels in Asia, amenities for RA are not at par, but this is just a property policy nothing to do with hard working staff. Club is not dedicated to Club members only, other guests may use by paying which creates some confusion and not as quite as other Clubs. Breakfast was limited, it is so so compare to other US hotels, however below par compare to IC Hotels in Asia or Europe. It is difficult to provide a rating for the location, on one hand it is great close to 6th street with restaurants and pubs but on the other hand very close to homeless shelter with lots of homeless around. Parking in only valet and can take up to 15 minutes to get your car, so plan ahead."
4,.Great spot to stay,"I love staying at The InterContinental when I am in Austin. There is a special fel to this hotel, it has the classic feel of the city and is located in an excellent spot to enjoy much of the city within walking distance.The staff are friendly, the rooms are great. It is easy to book and great to stay."
3,Open points.,"The room service food was horrible, worst hamburger I have had in a long time. Nice addition to have a 350 ml Mumms Cordon Rouge in the fridge! Better toilet paper at the men's room at the local Enco station. How can you not offer really good toilet paper? Body/hand lotion has cloying perfume, yick!Scrambled egg buffet was about equal to Holiday Inn Express. Hard scrambled eggs. Of all the concierge clubs I have stayed in including Mexico City and Mark Hopkins and the late Intercontinental in Galleria in Houston this was the worst of them all. I feel sorry for your hotel. The hamburger acrossthe street at the Driskill Cafe and Bakery sets the bar. You also can't get to the basement on the single elevator but it won't let you on the double elevators so it forces you to take it down to the 1st floor and transfer to one of the double elevators to go down one floor to the pool. I love this building and always will. I hope for its future."
5,Top Knotch,"If you ever in Austin the Steven F Austin is the place to stay!Friendly staff, wonderfully appointed rooms. The buffet was great. Your able to order eggs the way you like them, the server was very attentive. ( I wish I could remember he name (Veronica??)The front desk team was quick and professional with both our check in and check out.Net time we're in Austin this is where we'll stay."
5,Great Hotel,The staff was very accommodating and attentive to our needs. The bartender in the hotel bar was attuned to our likes and made relevant recommendations. The room was quiet and the air temperature controls were precise. The rooms have a bedside feature to control the air conditioner and also the lights which is convenient.
5,This hotel is beautiful,"I loved the spacious suite with seating area and vanity in the bathroom. Modern, stylish appointments and great food. The breakfast buffet was delicious and the service was great. Valet service was courteous and quick as well."
5,This is the place to stay. Period.,Such a great hotel - older building but great renovation. Staff was professional and friendly - I will definitely be back to enjoy the downtown area - this hotel is in the perfect location to walk around downtown - lots of great restaurants and live music venues
5,Comfort in Downtown Austin,"The Stephen F. Austin is centrally located in downtown and exudes a historic quality with modern touches. During my stay, I enjoyed spending time in the Bridal Suite, which is beautiful and modern with a nice view and great lighting.My regular guest room was very nice as well, though could have reflected the updated touches similar to the bridal suite. The bed is absolutely comfortable, though I prefer firmer pillows. The bathrooms are very clean and spacious with lovely toiletries. Room service was impeccable. I was able to order room service from my room and have it delivered to the bridal sweet for the bride. It was a wonderful surprise for her on her wedding day.Every staff member was fantastic and I found comfort in the fact that I always saw a member at any given time. Thought there was a small issue at check out, another staff member was there for the rescue!The bar is a great place to lounge and hang with friends and the balcony is top notch for the evening! I highly suggest you visit or even m"
5,Stunning Hotel w/ Exceptional Service!,"Our group recently stayed at the InterContinental for our annual corporate holiday functions. The hotel team went above and beyond to make sure our events were flawless. I can't say enough great things about the staff and this hotel! As the group planner, they made my life so easy - pre-event and post-event. As well, the location is the best in the city - a few blocks from the Capitol and walking distance to great restaurants and bars. As well, the bed was super comfortable and the room was very spacious. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a visit to downtown Austin."
5,Great Gem in Downtown Austin,What an awesome gem in the middle of Austin! Right on congress street with comfortable rooms and perfect beds. Very clean with great service all around. The Roaring Fork is a great restaurant and bar in the lobby of the hotel. One of the better properties I have stayed at in downtown Austin!
5,Loved it!,"Fabulous hotel with a wonderful location. Definitely recommend this hotel. Staff was nice, restaurant was nice and the bar was classy with a nice little balcony outside. I will definitely stay here on my next visit."
5,This is the one!,There are lots of hotels in this six-square block area. This one is definitely the best considering the price and upscale amenities. I used it for many business meeetings and have my clients stay there. I’d choose this one over any of the adjacent hotels. Easy walk to capitol all the way to Town Lake. Also right across from great galleries. Great restaurants and next to sixth street - but still quiet!
5,"Beautiful Venue, Exceptional Service, top notch!","We recently stayed 2 nights while attending a company event. It is hard to say enough about what a wonderful experience we had; every detail was ""top notch!"" The hotel is beautiful & elegant, yet comfortable & cozy. We stayed in the newly redecorated Governor's Suite; the room accommodations and the suite's amenities are top notch. The design is beautiful; it is elegant yet comfortable with every detail considered. The range of amenities provided is well thought-out and all of this combined to make our stay easy and enjoyable. And, as ""icing on the cake"" both literally and figuratively, extra special attention was given to the fact that is was also my husband's birthday! We received exceptional service - from the friendly service at the front desk to the bell and valet services. Breakfast at Club Intercontinental was delicious and also provided extraordinary service. In fact, everyone we encountered during our stay provided quality service and displayed a professional manner. The hotel and event staff amazed us with their dedication and the hard work they delivered on our behalf to create and provide an enjoyable, successful company event. We give our highest recommendation to the InterContinental Stephen F Austin!"
4,Nice but loud and a little rowdy,I went to the lounge at the Stephen F recently after an event in downtown Austin. The staff was very attentive and polite but there was a wedding party and it was loud and that made for a less pleasant experience. It would be nice it the areas for the private parties was not close to the public lounge but I understand that if probably impossible. That being said it is a beautiful lounge and as I said the staff was incredibly attentive for a crowded lounge on a Friday night. Also great wine selection with reasonable prices for such a nice hotel lounge in downtown Austin. I recommend this place as a must go to place in downtown Austin. (I have also spent a weekend at the hotel. The rooms are a little on the expensive side but so worth it and very beautiful!)
5,very nicely redone historic hotel--nice ambiance,"Loved our stay here. Geat location to walk to 6th Street, The Capital, and Bullock, etc. The deluxe room is large and worth the extra cost. Everything appeared new.. Nice furntiture and carpet. Great bed. Large bathroom redone and tastefuully updated. Great showerhead - and nice and high. HVAC a bit noisy but ohterwise it was a terrific room. Happy hour in the bar--great friendly service. . Excellent buffet breakfast in the Club--prebuy the breakfast to save a few bucks. Excellent service there by Salih. Very nice pool, spa, and exercice room in the basement--not busy. Very updated but had the feel of an older luxury hotel pool area. Nice and quiet . Know about the $40 valet charge to park your car. but do not park yourself in the Perry Brooks garage next door. It gets you for two days if you stay past 10am (or something like that in the morning). Ridiculous!!!!!!!!"
5,Elegant and historic location in Austin,"Great large room, wonderful amenities, amazing service. This was one of the best stays in a hotel I have ever had because the staff were so caring and genuine. My wife and I were so happy to have stayed here and would definitely be back. Also the building has some character because it's not so old and very solid which makes it pretty quiet considering the location."
4,Annual Team review business trip,"The hotel location and room facilities are excellent, staff is friendly and very helpful, but the food at the hotel is pathetic and expensive. I also had to wait long time for my room to be ready, finally my room was ready at about 4pm (??), normal check in time is 3:00pm, the rooms in lower level, especially on the corner of Congress and 7th are very noisy in the evenings, the singing from the bar in level 2 is very annoying especially if you are trying to sleep early"
5,Great Stay,"Everything was fantastic; reception, the bar, the room, everything. The entire facility was very clean and we wanted for nothing. The location was fantastic and the loft area outside of the bar made for a cozy area for a night cap."
5,Above and Beyond!,"So friendly! Very cute hotel! Great Location!And on top of that, when making the reservation my girlfriend told them it was my birthday and asked them to put a twix on my pillow. They not only had a twix for me but they also made me a happy birthday dessert! Free of charge! So nice!"
4,Great Location!,"Nice property in a great location. The Traditional room and bathroom were quite small. Given the price per night I didn't think this was a good value. Front desk was slow during check-in and check-out. No local map at front desk, referred to concierge who was busy. Not impressed."
5,Great service - no hiccups,Stayed at this InterContinental for a weekend in mid-November 2017. The service was very professional and relatable on a human level with all employees I interacted with from reception to concierge to cleaning staff to breakfast servers. Also very central location and yet I found it to be quiet from my room. I would not hesitate to return here on future Austin trips.
4,Great Boutique hotel,The club room is amazing Pay of this service.....The best breakfast ever So is the Roaring Fork restaurant.... Eleni the concierge is wonderful... next to the Paramount Theatre with great shows Great location..
1,"Bad customer service, Rooms are very loud.",The shower handle fell off it was not repaired until the next day. The hotel is in need of a remodel and the rooms are very noisy. The manager was very rude when he finally called me the next day. Do your self a favor and avoid this hotel.
3,Okay stay. Would I stay again. No,This place is ok. Parking is over rated. 49.95. They don’t have vending machines for drinking and would allow us to bring a coke to our room. The air wouldn’t work so we were sweating out butts off !!
5,well done,"remodeled historic hotel in heart of Austin. Fresh, new, furniture, paint, rooms etc. .very nice health club. recommend staying there. Friendly staff. bar and restaurant are worth checking out. TV's are fantastic!"
5,My daughter's wedding reception and hotel stay,"We had the most beautiful wedding reception at InterContinental Stephen F. Austin.It is such a beautiful venue. Great location in downtown Austin, you can see the Capitol on Congress Street. The bar and ballroom has a wrap arond balcony with tables and chairs that overlook downtown Austin. Everything was executed to perfection. Awesome sales staff, friendly and professional. The Director of Catering made sure all of our requests were perfected to every little detail. The food was absolutely delicious, our compliments to the chef.The guests rooms are beautiful and clean, super comfortable bed and pillows. We would highly reccommend this hotel."
5,One of my favorites,"This hotel has everything I love. First off, it's historic. I feel like I stepped into another time when I enter through the front doors. My favorite era for architecture is 1880-1930 & this hotel delivers. No detail has been forgotten. Secondly, their plushy beds. It wouldn't be an Intercontinental without those beds, Frette linens and down comforters-right? One of the best features: all their rooms are big rooms. They would be considered a suite in other hotels (hoping I get one with a soaking/big tub on my upcoming trip 1st week of December). Last, but not least their staff is so gracious and they go the extra mile. I love room service coffee & sometimes breakfast before heading to meetings. This hotel doesn't disappoint. I can eat healthy and their food is delicious. Oh almost forgot about their great bar w/ tasty strong drinks downstairs. Dimly lit, lots of wood and very cozy. Why would I stay at any other hotel in Austin, much less a conference hotel?"
5,beautiful historical hotel,This hotel is a historical gem. The foyer is gorgeous with a sweeping staircase. The rooms were recently renovated. Stephen F’s bar on the second floor is a great Happy Hour location. The staff is so friendly!
5,Best Hotel in Austin,The InterContinental Stephen F. Austin is exceptional. The rooms are large and comfortable. The service is grand. Wifi free if you are a member. The bar/restaurant inside offers great meals as well. It was a superb visit. I recommend it highly.
4,Nice downtown location,"Stayed for 2 nights, hotel is very nice, clean and comfortable. Quiet, but close to all the 6th street entertainment. Was able to walk to the convention center and anything I needed . Did not use the bar or Restraunt , but looked nice . Pretty quiet overall"
4,Very Nice. Centrally located.,"Getting in on a wedding rate took the edge off the price here. It is pricey but it is a lovely hotel, Easy walking distance to all the fun on 6th street. From the front desk to the restaurant the staff is very good. (My wife does think the rooms are a bit small.)"
5,Great hotel!,"We stayed here for 2 nights this week to experience downtown Austin. The hotel is beautiful and our room was very comfortable. We chose to stay in a club level room which was slightly more, but well worth the extras (full breakfast and great happy hour with drinks and appetizers). The location is great with easy walking to many restaurants, the state capitol, Sixth Street and the visitor center. I am a jogger and it was very convenient to the trails along Lady Bird Lake. The service was top notch. I had read reviews about the cost of parking, so we chose to skip a car. We took the bus from the airport ($1.25) that stopped a couple of blocks away, and then took uber anywhere we didn't want to walk to. Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area."
5,Dog friendly wonderful hotel!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff was friendly, welcoming and enormously helpful. The room was lovely and comfortable with every amenity we needed included without even having to call downstairs. We will be back, and we recommend this beautifully run hotel experience to others!"
4,Comfort and Elegance,"This hotel is upscale and elegant. The beds are quite comfortable, too. The location is fantastic, near the Capitol and the Paramount Theater and within walking distance to Sixth Street. The valet is a little pricey for overnight parking, but worth the extra expense."
5,Birthday weekend Girls Trip,"Austin is a great place visit and the Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin is in the perfect location.The staff was very helpful and nice, would definitely stay there again and recommend the ""club lounge"""
5,Stay here,"Beautiful room, exemplary staff, prime location. I arrived at midnight on a rainy night and everyone was so helpful and friendly that I instantly felt comfortable. I was traveling alone for work and am always a bit scared arriving places so late but they were ready for me and I was even able to order room service (arrived in 15 minutes). I look forward to returning with my family some day."
5,Halloween getaway in room 1103,"This hotel was EVERYTHING!! First off the staff was friendly and informative. The lobby was clean and inviting. Got to our room and opened the door....NICE, SPACIOUS ROOM, VERY CLEAN, and THE RESTROOM...AWESOME!!! I was aware of all fees and prepared to pay even for internet, but at check in I was told that if I was a member with IHG REWARDS the internet is FREE....sign me up!! Valet was $45 for oversized vehicle. AND the fully stocked mini bar is censored so if you touch it you bought it!!!! If you so happen to leave your charger behind for your phone NO WORRIES they got you covered with charges for all kinds of phone hooked to the telephone. Also on the night there’s a control box to the lights in the room....no need to walk and turn off lights. What else can I say except GO AHEAD AND BOOK YOUR ROOM ITS WORTH IT!!!!"
3,nice property but substandard room,Very nice property in great location with great staff. Very small room and the smallest bathroom I have ever experienced in any hotel. I requested a different room but the staff would not accommodate a change
3,Parking,"No self parking, initially I was giving a room that was not consistent wit my reservation, after three tries I finally got the top of room I reserved. Additionally I was charged a full night for early departure when I was told at the front desk specifically that I will not be charged (except) de $75 fee) for early departure."
1,Poor Cusomter Service,"I was billed almost $3000 erroneously and I had to contact the hotel several times just to have it refunded. Then I called to cancel 1 of my two rooms 48 hours prior to arrival and was told by the Central Reservation Agent I could cancel because it was a ""flex"" rate but I had to call the hotel directly. Hotel staff gave me the run around then said no I could not cancel. Billed because minibar items shifted when I used the space they urge you to use within the mini bar for your items. Billed two different rates for parking to similar size cars on the same night??? why? I was contacted about these issues with an apology and a promise that the issues would be looked into, however a week later I have not heard anything."
5,Very Nice But Overpriced,"I normally stay at the Historic Driskill across the street, but thought I would try the Stephen F. Austin this year. It is very nice, but nothing special. The Driskill is historic and the room design from the shape, furnishing and even the faucets, make it unique. The Intercontinental rooms are just like every other Intercontinental, nice but standard. Not worth the high cost in my opinion."
4,Nice stay,Overall a nice stay. Old hotel with modern updates. Very friendly staff. Manager is very nice. Hotel is at a very nice location. Wish they had shuttle service to the convention center. Restaurant is nice too.
5,Outstanding Visit,"This is a really unique and storied hotel. In staying in some similar style hotels in other cities, I can say that one of the problems is typically the room being up to date, including well working AC, new and updated restroom, technology upgrades, etc. This hotel had all of these items modernized while still having the charm of being a very historic hotel. All of the employees were very courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend room service, as well; it was delicious. If you are headed to Austin, check this hotel out."
2,Pet Policy,"I stayed there for the formula 1 weekend. Next door neighbor had a dog that wouldn't stop barking. Thank goodness for F1 earplugs. I have never experienced this in over 25 years of hotel stay. Discussed this with front desk, who told me that the hotel policy allowed pets, I referred her to the brochure which said the opposite and her response was that it needed to be updated. Needless to say I was incensed. Thankfully, the next morning, manager refunded my charge for the night and by the time I came back later that night, either neighbor had left or been relocated. I have nothing against pets, but if that is the hotel's policy, then either have sound proof rooms or a pet free floor. Will be awhile before I stay at any of their hotels again and I am an IHG owner!"
5,Excellent Stay,"The staff was amazing and so helpful (room block for me and my colleagues), room accommodations were fantastic, our private reception was great. The dining in the restaurant was also phenomenal. Absolutely loved my stay!"
5,Top of the Line Service,I got the HONEY MOON suite. The service was outstanding and they took care of everything for me. The view from the 16th floor was great. The bed was extremely comfortable. Every person that works there smiles all the time and are very friendly.
4,Great Location,"This hotel is right in the heart of downtown with well appointed, good sized rooms. Room was very clean however counter space in the bathroom was limited and shower left water on the floor. Very friendly customer service. Nice bar on second floor with outdoor balcony."
3,"nice facility, good location, staff help hit and miss","front desk helpful, no service in upstairs lounge, had to go to bar for service and then not very friendly, outside furniture worn, cushions old. some of valets very good others just doing their job. would not take much to make this a ritz like experience . if all the staff was as good as the best staff it would be a big improvement."
5,Formula weekend 2017,"Thank you so much to Eleni at concierge for awesome weekend!!! My sons gave it a 10, from the restaurants to the driver and the race. Thank you everyone, treating us to a first class time....restaurant staff found my son's retainers and had them waiting for us on Saturday night."
5,BEST Downtown Lux Hotel,"The Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin is hands-down the BEST luxury hotel in downtown Austin. The bar has a balcony with a beautiful view of the Capitol and is a great place to take in downtown with your favorite libation. The rooms are well appointed, and the beds are super-comfy. Room Service is EXCELLENT, and do have at least one meal at the Roaring Fork which knows food and service at the 5-star level.The hotel staff are always pleasant and willing to do anything to make your stay special - just ask! The valet also is prompt and professional. The feel is TRUE and TRADITIONAL TEXAS at it's best. Suggest asking for a higher floor as street noise can be a problem (no fault of the hotel). The hot tub, lap pool and work out area is well-maintained and a great place to unwind. Enjoy! We will be back!"
5,Very nice visit,"Thanks to the concierge Leni we had the best trip to Texas. Not only did she lay out our Austin stay but other parts of Texas as well. My wife said her anniversary trip was perfect.The hotel was nice, people were friendly. Room was small but comfortable and had everything we needed. We appreciated the anniversary surprise. Breakfast was average and the rest of our meals we ate out. When ATT went down city wide, the staff help get us access to the outside world.Would whole heartedly recommend staying here."
4,Intercontinental service stuffed into a more classic older hotel,"The Intercon in Austin is housed in a older iconic hotel that holds back on how it can be. Newer hotels will race by the Intercon at this rate, in terms of room quality and general hotel ambience.I had a suite and club access, but it was rather unclear where the club was. The description made it sound like it shared time with the breakfast area, but I didn’t look very hard for it either.The suite was nice, though dated in styling - I suppose for the hotel motif. The bathroom needed an upgrade, as the bathtub/shower was peeling and feels fairly budget for a suite.The elevator bank was annoying for use for the basement, as you needed to use the main 2 to get there. The basement had a small lap pool and jacuzzi, and the gym. The gym was reasonably extensive, but the pool/jacuzzi was a bit underwhelming.Location wise, it’s excellent being on the corner of Congress, and a short walk to the State house. A great spot to wander from in the downtown area.Service was good overall, so as I say it’s a good overall job for Intercon, but it’s held back by the building/facilities."
5,Customer and cleanliness,The stay was great in center of the night lift on the weekend. Customer service was great. Hotel was very clean. Love it. We had a gym and nice lap pool. We were there for ACL festival. The hotel was not far from the park.
3,Outdated but in good condition,We stayed just one night before catching a flight out. We like the club lounge because it gets us away from the big buffet breakfast crowd. There was a room called the .club lounge' but it was not the normal club lounge. Everyone has breakfast in there and although we had breakfast included in our rate there was an additional charge for any eggs other than the scrambled egg. The scrambled egg was so bad it made my wife sick. It had a sickly smell to it and clearly came from a packet. Scrambled egg is not hard to make unless you are adding things to keep the cost down.The building is in good condition but very dated. We had an early check in which was very helpful. Overall it is very expensive when compared to some of the really good Intercontinental Hotels like Delhi and KL.
4,"Great location, friendly staff!","We were in Austin for medical reasons and not able to enjoy Austin, but we were very happy with our Room and the service. The room and bath was a bit small for the rate we paid, but it was a weekend with lots going in in Austin. The location was ideal for enjoying the evenings and local restaurants. The front desk did allow us to have a late check-out do to our flight out being later in the day. I would recommend staying at the property."
5,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,Went way beyond expectations. Perfect location/ outstanding service and guest relations/top notch restaurant/staff could not be more accommadating. Perfect if doing business downtown or at the capitol. Loved the histotic elements of the property with a modern touch
2,"Great hotel, not so great guests","A neighbor was been smoking out in his/her room. The smoke first came through the bathroom vent, and hours later through the AC. After calling and complaining, they offered a room switch, but it was midnight. Then, the next morning, happened all over again. I left the hotel with a headache, a sore throat, and a missed meeting due to a sleepless night. In hindsight, I should've done a midnight room switch. Not to narc on someone's good time, but expected much more from a nicer hotel."
2,Poor club member telations,"Very disappointed in so-called ""upgrade"" of room. Placed in a small 4th. Floor room overlooking the mechanical system and parking garage. Nothing more than a noisy dark tunnel. Room touted as a City view?"
5,Amazing two weeks,"It was my first time in Austin and I was amazed by everything. There is so much character in this hotel I felt like I was back in the old times and they have so much history to share. Location is perfect with so many things to do. Exceptional staff from the valet they will open the door for you with their genuine smiles... Front desk staff were pleasant and very accommodating. I love when I received champagne and chocolates and my husband enjoyed it a lot. And the most important part is the bed and pillows, they were heaven, the most comfortable bed I ever had. Thank you Intercontinental Stephen F. Austin for the memorable experience."
4,Nice Hotel,"We traveled to Austin for a weekend wedding, and the hotel met our needs nicely. Check-in process was very slow as new computer software had just been installed. Location of hotel is great to see Austin. Room and bar prices seemed high to us, but we would visit again."
4,It couldn't be in a better place,Even though the service is great... Rooms and deco are a little outdated... But most important the gym is terrible for a hotel of this category!...I must mentioned the location is in the middle of the downtown area and that makes up for the rest...
5,Last minute accommodations due to neighboring hotel sell-out,The staff @ the InterContinental SFA was amazing. I got into town and found out my reservation at a neighboring hotel was made incorrectly and I was without a room. They immediately took care of setting me up with a hotel room and even upgraded me to one of their huge King Suites!Thank you very much for taking care of this stranded business traveler!
5,Great Stay!,I just stayed at the hotel for business. Their location is downtown convenient to restaurants & night life. My room was very nice and I loved their cute round signs letting me know where to find plugs.
3,Given Wrong Room - No Reimbursement,"Right off the bat Concierge said that they only had single beds left. I ordered a Superior Double Bed for 3 guests. Concierge said since I made the reservation through a Reward based system (Chase Rewards), no information came through about what sort of room you wanted. I'm pretty sure that's bull though. I've never had trouble ordering the room I want using Chase or AmEx rewards."
4,Great hotel,"This hotel was a good place to stay on our trip to Austin. It was accessible to a lot of restaurants although I didn't feel like it was accessible to much shopping. The front staff were always nice and courteous. One very early morning, there was a verbal altercation in the room next door that lasted over 10 minutes. I finally called the front desk, and they had someone up to take care of it immediately. I would stay here again. Everyone in my group was a little disappointed that they didn't have a real pool."
4,Austin wedding,"We have stayed at many Inter Continental hotels in many countries over the years because you can always depend on the great service. That being said, my husband's status helped us to achieve an upgrade. Loved having the extra half bath. Thanks to the people at check-in, my husband's preferences were takne into consideration. Feather pillows were fresh and plump."
4,nice Austin Hotel,"First visit to Austin, and glad we stayed at the S.Austin. Conveniently located downtown and a nice short distance from the State Capital (great tour) and some of the downtown bar activities.negatives would be strange breakfast policy. We went to their restaurant/bar area and they didnt serve breakfast. When we got home we discovered from others that there was a private breakfast room (which we could have used since i am an IHG member."
5,Saracini/McGuire Wedding,"The hotel is quaint Old Austin and has been renovated and is quite beautiful. It is spacious and inviting and love the upstairs outdoor deck off the bar. Food at the restaurant/bar was really delicious. Not sure why some say the rooms are too small, my guests didn't complain. If you are spending that much time in your room, shame on you, Austin is a lot of fun. The staff is the best thing about the hotel. From Justin helping all the wedding reservations to all those like Sami at the front desk, you couldn't ask for a better crew! They are there for your every need. Thumbs up to the entire time we stayed!"
5,Great place to stay in Austin,"We really enjoyed our stay at the InterContinental. The location is great, close to everything but not too close (6th Street gets pretty loud). The staff was warm and welcoming, and our room was very comfortable. We'd definitely stay here again!"
5,Family trip,Very convenient location for walkingStaff very accommodating and politeWill stay there again on our next visitRooms were spaciousBed was very comfortable with nice linensSafe and secure environmentGood value and price
2,It pains me to say this...,"Please read the ""terrific"" and ""very good"" reviews of other visitors. I don't want to poison the well. I'll bet I would agree with all, or almost all, of them. The Stephen F. has a top notch service staff, a well renovated early 20th century space, and the location couldn't be better! Roaring Fork is awesome! (See my recent restaurant review). There are a couple quirky room servicing issues, but nothing to hyperventilate over at all.This review would otherwise be a four to (probably) five star review, but for -- accounting. I asked for my bill the night before check out. They very politely told me didn't want to give it to me, and I didn't want to press. Very early on checkout morning, the receptionist looked over the bill, but did not ask me to do the same (shame on me), and stuck it in an envelope. I got to where I needed to work several blocks away and saw that my room rate, over three nights (Monday to Wednesday overnights) fluctuated among rates of $347.50 to $410.00 to $324.50.Close to two hours of calls ensued. Most of them featured claims that I was uninformed by not knowing the common practice of hotels to adjust the room rates of committed customers based on the number of openings the hotel had open. I kept conceding the I understood weekend and seasonal differences, but was unwilling to agree that ""all"" hotels changed their room rates nightly (and in real time!) based upon occupancy.After way too much time on hold and several discussions with several people, at my suggestion, the hotel agreed to reduce the rate I was charged across the board to the lowest rate I had been charged, which was still higher than what they were offering to last minute guests. I concluded that the hotel's practice is all about how to maximize value to the hotel for every transaction at the expense of the guest. I won't be coming back.Getting an updated folio to reflect the adjusted charges, which I need for my employer, was an interrelated, equally frustrating exercise that just isn't worth the time to lay out. Even the person who eventually sent me the corrected folio admitted the process was brutal."
5,Favorite Austin hotel,Love everything about this hotel. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The staff is friendly and attentive and you can't beat the location. The food (room service and restaurant on hotel property) is really good too!
5,Old World Charm-Modern Conveniences,"Loved the architecture and ambience of the hotel. I was afraid that it wouldn't have modern conveniences but the room had everything we needed, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom spacious, the restaurant was great, the staff was overly helpful."
5,Stephen F. Austin Hotel,"I stay in Austin 5 to 10 days a month for business, I always stay at the Intercontinental my home away from home. They treat me very well, and the entire staff remembers me each time I go. Love the older original hotels in all the cities I do business in and this one is excellent. Great 2nd floor outdoor balcony over Congress street for drinks or afternoon email catch up."
5,Fabulous Place to Stay,"Everything about this property was perfect. The location is very convenient, all staff was extremely friendly and helpful, room was nice and large and the bar was great. The entire hotel was spotless! We will definitely be back."
5,17 years of success,We started staying in the SFA when it reopened in 2000 and have stayed many times since then. I do not ever recall having any unresolved problem with the hotel or staff and no problem I have had has been a biggie. You are getting exactly what you expect at an Intercontinental Hotel.
5,Great Hotel Service,"We stayed four nights there. Great staff at the front desk and at the door. It's in a prime location as well. Probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Our friends who were also staying there said the same thing about the bed. We didn't watch much TV but it was large. Good bathroom amenities. The only downfalls are that the room is a tad small, the iron was old and left residue on a shirt I ironed and we wish there was a fridge in the room for when we had leftovers from dinner. I'd recommend the hotel overall...would give it 4.5 out of 5 if I could."
3,Must be a bad day,"We ordered breakfast with hang tag for 2. we were on a tight schedule; so we called 20 minutes before to confirm our order. Breakfast came for only 1. They sent up 2nd, but we were late for our business meeting."
5,Weekend without the kids,Austin was a great place to visit. The Intercontinental was centrally located. We didn't need to Uber except for the airport and back. We went to the roaring fork and had a few drinks during happy hour. The hotel room was very nice and clean. The bed was comfy. The hot tub smelled like eucalyptus. The lap pool only had one other guest in it for our whole 4 night stay. Late check out and holding our bags was super since our flight didn't leave until 7pm. This place was great!
3,Not worth the money,"The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Austin, only a few blocks away from the capitol building. It is also close enough to walk to where all the actions are at night but far enough for the room to stay quiet. However, the room is barely big enough to open our luggages and the bathroom does not even have a countertop for our toiletries. That being said, the vanity kit included in the bathroom was nice and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom tub was leaking a bit after showering. In general, the rooms were a bit outdated, as there were much evidence of wear and tear (scrapes and chipped paint). The parking fee was ridiculous. It was $43/night (inclusive of taxes). For about $300/night, the hotel was pretty disappointing."
5,The Best Hotel in Austin,"I have stayed at a number of hotels in Austin and this is the best. 5 stars!Located in the heart of city, near Capital, near the action on 4th St, 6th St, and of course all the venues on Congress Ave.Worth the money, great staff, this place is top shelf! Speaking of which they have that, too."
5,NICE DOWNTOWN HISTORIC HOTEL,"The Stephen F. Austin is a delightful historic property located downtown near the State Capital. I loved the overall vibe of the hotel, including the jazz soundtrack played in the public areas. The amenities were modern, yet the decor paid respect to the history of the hotel. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. I received exceptional service from Vineet in the Club Lounge as well as Rusvier at the Front Desk. The room was nicely decorated and very comfortable. The Fitness Center and pool were also enjoyable and nicely equipped. The hotel respects the spirit of the Ambassador program, and I appreciated the nice upgrade and overall treatment."
5,Surprise Birthday Celebration Weekend Stay,"This hotel stay was one of my very best.....great room reservations, with a great view! The best part of our stay, was the OUTSTANDING WORLD-CLASS SERVICE provided by Vineet.....he has consistently exceeded our expectations during everyone of our stays, while he's been working at this hotel."
5,Company Summit,"In planning for almost a year our company conducted a 2 day summit of approximately 70 business development professionals from across the country at the Stephen F. Austin in mid August. The facility, its location, cleanliness and amenities proved to be excellent for this group. The staff was overly accommodating and i would recommend it to any group of this size or smaller looking for an all inclusive facility to have such an event.Thanks to the staff at the Intercontinental for making all of us that were involved in the planning look like we knew what we were doing.A BIG thumbs up!"
5,Excellent Experience,"I couldn't have asked for more from my stay here for my mother's birthday celebration in Austin. Classic, beautiful hotel with so much to offer. The rooms are well appointed with so many thoughtful amenities including charging cables for types of phones, bluetooth connections to the radio and comfortable bed and sofa. It was hard to leave the room. Everyone who works at the hotel is friendly and professional. The concierge, Eleni, was wonderful and sent up some goodies to my mother's room for her birthday. She truly made our stay extra special. One of my favorite hotel experiences."
3,Not a 5 Star,"Stayed for the weekend, hotel was full, service in front desk was poor, 4 people waiting in line.. not even a 3 star hotel. Had to turn mattress clockwise due to the worn of it. Really ?? Bad mattress?? No vent on the bathrooms. Location is the only matter here. Beware the only way to park is paying 45USD for valet."
4,Austin in August,"Great customer service. Great, convenient location. Comfortable, clean accommodations. Loved the fresh fruit-infused ice water in the lobby! Didn't have an opportunity to use this trip, but also love the book library in the lobby."
5,Amazing Hotel...,"My crew where is schedule for a different hotel in Austin. So, we were assign to this hotel. This was my first time at this hotel. What a beautiful hotel. I had a corner room and it was super clean and beautiful and very large. The staff was professional and very helpful. The hotel is right downtown Austin and alot of place to see and place to eat."
5,Excellent service!,The Intercontinental is my go to hotel when traveling to Austin for business. The service is always exceptional and the hotel is well maintained. Location is very central being close to restaurants and coffee shops.
5,Amazing hotel - stay here while in Austin,"Located at a very convenient location in downtown Austin, this hotel should not be missed for business or a romantic get away. Walk to the capitol or sixth street - whatever your fancy. - beautiful ambiance, convenient location, and fantastic customer service.I look forward to returning soon."
5,Anniversary Vacation,"The hotel got us in early, upgraded our room, sent chocolates and allowed a late check out...they were AMAZING! I would reccommend staying here or any InterContinental to my friends and family...truly top notch :)"
1,Pet deposit = pet fee - Misleading advertisement,"BEWARE --- Intercontinental Austin advertises itself as pet friendly and that there is a ""pet deposit"" required, but this ""deposit"" is actually a non-refundable pet fee of $100 ($115 with ""taxes"")!When booking a hotel for my partner and myself, I specifically looked for pet friendly hotels that would host our well-behaved, 30 lb short-haired dog. Intercontinental Austin advertised that ""Animals under 60 lbs. are welcome. Pet deposit required."" This is typical of many pet friendly hotels that will require a hold charge for incidentals, but will REFUND said deposit when you check out and have not caused them reason to charge you. I thought nothing of it and was pleased to find that the staff were indeed very friendlytoward us and our dog and that the accommodations were very nice. However, upon checkout I discover that the ""pet deposit"" is actually a $100 NON-REFUNDABLE FEE and that the waiver I had been asked to sign upon checkin was not the typical pet deposit damage waiver but actually a waiver agreeing to pay $100 regardless, just to have my pet accompany us in our room. Why on earth would a pet owner opt to take their pet with them to a hotel if they were going to be charged as much as it would cost to get their pet its own hotel room?The staff, service, and accommodations were very nice, but I am very disappointed with the false advertisement. Please be aware that if you are planning to travel to Intercontinental Austin with your pet, you are looking at $115 on top of the $40 parking and your total fee. If you want a truly dog friendly hotel, try Westin Austin Downtown."
5,My new favorite place in Austin...,"Friendly staff, helpful and kind, beautiful mix of vintage and modern, a calm environment from pool to second floor terrace to suite, well-rounded buffet breakfast downstairs, a great escape...simply a perfectly great place all around. Birthday celebration was made all the more happy due to staff members just being normal, nice, friendly people (in the hotel world that's most often the missing piece -- just nice and normal). Big thanks to Alix (you will never know how much your kindness meant to us) and the rest of the front desk gang, the restaurant staff, concierge (happy birthday) woman and valets (they run like the wind in that sweltering Austin heat)...we'll be back and will highly recommend your establishment every chance we get. Doesn't get better than this...thanks again!"
4,Nice but expensive,"Beware of hidden charges. They charge $40 for valet parking and the alternative garage did not seem very safe. Nice room, though. And the patio bar overlooking Congress Avenue is nice, especially if you take advantage of happy hour specials."
4,Great getaway in the heart of Austin,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at The Intercontinental. They went above and beyond to accommodate me and make our trip enjoyable. They gave great recommendations on where to eat and drink and best of all most places were walking distances or a quick Lyft ride!
5,"Awesome, Conveniently located hotel in Austin",We stayed at this hotel recently and I have to say that it did not disappoint the Intercontinental brand. We arrived at 2pm what could easily be considered the hype of the day for arrivals in that part of the city and the arrival experience was flawless. We were promptly greeted at our car by Daniel & Gerardo who both despite how busy they were running cars in the extreme 110 degree Texas heat still managed to keep a smile on their face and offer a level of hospitality welcome second to none. The front desk did a great job at identifying my IHG account as well to ensure it was attached to my reservation as well as providing my wife and I with a nice room. The hotel itself is conveniently located to many restaurants and night clubs if you prefer to have a night out of fun. The hotel restaurant where we had a drink on the upper floor deck also has cigars available for smoking outside. simply marvelous. Kudos to the staff!!!!!!!
5,Amazing Customer Service,"I stopped at the front desk at around 11 pm to ask if there was a coffee shop opent hat would serve hot chocolate. There wasn't really anything around, but Ludi and Vineet insisted on making me a unique recipe and bringing it along with cookies to my room despite me saying it wasn't really necessary. I couldn't have asked for more personal service."
5,Last Getaway,My wife and I took one last getaway before we had our first child and decided to stay here. Absolutely loved the room! Amazing view and they upgraded us out of generosity. We felt appreciated and the service was very good. We will stay here again on our next trip to austin!
1,Even your grandma would think it's old,"Stupidly we were expecting what the hotel advertised.Got our gold membership upgrade but the room is so old & battered it needs putting out of its misery.Maybe those on business who don't pay themselves find it ok but for us on a vacation road trip expecting the luxury advertised are very disappointed.The bathroom is mouldy, has loose fittings and we have better dog towels than those provided.To top it all off you can hear traffic noise all day and night even on the 14th floor.Checking out early as there must be better in Austin"
5,Special Anniversery,"My wife of 38 years and I decided to stay at the Stephen F Austin for our anniversery night. The room they reserved for us was an upgraded king with a tremendous view down Congess. Also the concierge, Eleni prepared a very special welcome of champagne and a personal note for us when we arrived. I felt the staff put a lot of effort into making our stay special. The hotel is in great shape, the room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. We pretty much stayed on site the whole evening. We enjoyed the bar, dined at the Roaring Fork, and had breakfast at the hotel restaurant the next morning. All were very good. One thing that stands out is the friendliness of all the employees. They are there when you need them. This was an anniversary to remember and will definitely consider staying at the Stephen F Austin in the future."
5,Great staff,"Wonderful staff! Beautiful design, very comfortable. Quiet, convenient. But more than anything the service from all staff members was excellent- friendly, competent, personable. I will stay here again."
5,Very Relaxing,"It has been awhile since I visited Austin and each time is very different. InterContinetnal Stephen F. Austin gave me a trip of relaxation and peace of mind. Each staff who I came across was very delightful to work with. Checking in and out was a breeze, Housekeeping attendant was very thural in cleaning, and the service at the Club Lounge was enjoyable. Huge shoot out to Veronica (AM Server) Vineet (PM Server).Great Staff! Great Food! Great Team! Keep up the great work!"
5,Service you expect from an Intercontinental,I haven't stayed at an Intercontinental for 5 years and I now wonder why. Impeccable service. When we arrived the desk agents were helping two people and another person was in line in front of me. The concierge approached me and asked if i was an Ambassador (unfortunately not) but I offered that I was a Spire member of IHG rewards. She proceeded to take me to her desk to check me in. She offered me a map of the downtown Austin area and said sh'd be happy to answer any questions we have once we settled in. Our room was spacious with a sitting area and king bed. We walked around town on Saturday and came back to our room at 1pm ony to find housekeeping hadn't visited. We hung out teh come back later sign and received a note under our door asking us to call hen we wanted service. We called on our way out to dinner and by the time we returned our room had been serviced. My only suggestion is for the hotel to add more information on parking. When we arrived I asked the bellman if there was some place we could park. The bellman replied that they only had valet and offered us no other options. It would have been nice for him to point out the parking ramp just down the block.
5,Relax after tough work period,"Relaxed at SFA . Entire staff was polite and courteous. Food was great. Room service was prompted. Only suggestion is to add sugar free jams and syrup. Also, the addition of sugar free dessert would be awesome. I've stayed at the W, Hilton, Omni and others and this one is the top in its class.Location is great to take a nice walk. I recommend the hat box across the street. They have sold hats to Mick Jagger, Willie Nelson and others.Again, and all - this is a great hotel!!!!As a local business CEO I will be back to get some rest and enjoy being pampered."
5,Great place to stay in Austin!,This is a great place to stay in Austin! The deluxe king room was very nice with a couch and chair to relax on. The staff was helpful and friendly. They greet you every time you enter the lobby. Parking in a downtown hotel is always tricky.
5,"excellent hotel, conveniently located in downtown Austin.","Was not familiar with the hotel, but was extremely please about every aspect of my stay. Comfortable, clean and well-appointed room, attentive and helpful staff and an excellent in house restaurant. I highly recommend it for both business and personal travel."
5,Nice,We stayed one night but enjoyed the property. Nice room and friendly staff with great customer service. Very modern decor and directv with a king bed. It was nice to stay at a hotel with checkout at noon also!
5,Great front desk service,"I asked for a nicer room view and they accommodated so very well. Thank you!! Nothing but great things to say about property And perfect location. Be sure and walk up the street to see the bats, too! Amazing."
5,Terrific Staff and Stay,The front staff was very helpful and prompt to get me all checked in. I arrived much earlier than the normal check in hours and they accommodated me with no issues and even gave me a nice corner room!
4,Good except for parking,The hotel is great. The $40 valet cost is extreme. And then the valet boys all but beg for more tips. Perhaps if you lowered the $40 cost for valet your employees would make more tips. The valet cost is way too high.
3,Great central location makes up for lacking areas,This central walkable location is pretty fantastic for downtown Austin and we did enjoy that. The hotel was clean but otherwise this was just a standard stay. Our room was EXTREMELY small. There were only two of us but our view of the air-conditioning units paired with it being so small we had to take turns walking around the room kept our time in the room limited. The hallways seemed bigger than the room. It was very clean and staff were mostly attentive but without an outdoor pool to offer and stomaching the extremely high breakfast prices and parking made it just an OK stay for us. It's fine for a quick overnight but if we travel again for leisure we'll likely pick another property closer to the river or with more amenities that suit us.
4,A reliable stay in a great historic hotel.,"The Stephen F Austin is first and foremost one of the best located hotels in Downtown Austin whether in town for business or entertainment ..... most locations walkable. It also a very beautiful historic building. The service and staff were great. Kudos to the bartenders at the upstairs. Why nort 5 stars?? Number one, the room I had (and most rooms as I recall) are just a bit small with cramped bathrooms. Not much that can be done about that. The other is that the workout facility has only about half the weight machines that the room would hold and a more complete workout using machines is not feasible. Having said that I had a great overall stay and I will be back!"
5,Sami & David,Great location. The only issue had was check in time was 3 I arrived around 6 and still waited 30 minutes for room to be inspected. Sami & David are an asset to this company they were great. The restaurant was great. Tip order from your room then go down and grab food. Extra large portions and great flavor. Better pricing and much quicker than room service. Would definitely stay again
5,Everything just perfect at Stephen f Austin!,Super friendly staff in a fabulous hotel. Classy yet comfortable room. Great vibe in lobby and attached restaurants. A smile from every employee we met. Great location in downtown Austin with so many bars and restaurants within a few blocks. Didn't want to leave.
5,Great historic hotel,"This is a gem of a hotel. It is historic so you will enjoy the sweeping staircase, large lobby and wonderful paintings of Stephen F. Austin (the hotel's namesake).We organize conferences at this hotel and our attendees love the facilities. Be sure to visit the bar on the second floor. It is a real hangout for locals as well as hotel guests."
5,Amazing hotel!,"My girlfriend and I came here for a night away and it was great! The staff treated us so well, especially Vineet, who was graciously and kindly taking care of us in the lounge. If you're in Austin, stay here and make sure to say hi to Vineet for us!"
5,Great stay!,I had a very clean and comfortable room. I did not want to get out of the comfy bed. The hotel staff was very helpful and my room service was delicious. Hotel is located in a very central spot in downtown Austin so I was able to walk everywhere I need to go. Look forward to my next stay.
5,Great location,"Fantastic hotel right in the heart of Austin - just a block from 6th street and a few blocks from the capital. Terrific service and staff. On site restaurant was fantastic - glad we tried it. Hotel bar with outside seating was very nice, but you're paying about double the price of drinks as compared to local bars. Rooms are comfortable and they give you all aveda toiletries. Downside is the valet parking - $40 a day."
5,Family Event,"Our daughter was married in Austin and we used the hotel for the wedding guests. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was great! We used one of their boardrooms for hair and make-up and it was set up with mirrors, tall chairs and tables. The staff kept us well stocked with snacks and drinks. Also very accommodating with helping us store flowers in coolers. It was a great experience for everyone. Thank you very much!"
5,Weekend in Austin,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Austin. The accomodations are first rate, only to be outdone by the staff, 5 star all the way! The hotel has a great view of the capital building from the 2nd floor balcony off the bar, where we enjoyed cocktails under the shade of the beautiful trees on the street. You are only a block away from the bars and restaurants on 6th street, and less than a five minute walk to the waterfront. The rooms are very nicely appointed with a large living area, the bedding is fabulous, and there is a large vanity area in the bathroom aside from the sink. There is even a small area in the minibar fridge for personal use."
5,New favorite hotel in Austin,"I have visited Austin many times for work and leisure and this is now my favorite Austin hotel. I used to stay across the street and that is still nice but a little too formal and dark inside. The Stephen F has perfect blend of location, size (not too large) historical charm but contemporary feel.The concierge and staff are of course top notch which you can expect at any Intercon property, and was very impressed with the quality of the food in the Club Intercon lounge. Usually its a bit wedding buffet at these types of amenities but we actually skipped breakfast out every day and dinner one night based on what we ate here!Be sure to have a drink on the Terrace--an almost New Orleans style second story patio with incredible views yet you feel hidden from the overflow of 6th street bustle below. My new go-to Austin spot."
2,Beautiful property; abysmal service.,"While the hotel itself is just gorgeous, every single person with whom we interacted at the Stephen F. Austin ranged from indifferent at best to downright rude, often appallingly so. I have stayed in 4 star hotels coast to coast and never have I experienced such rudeness and shoddy treatment. I would be appalled to be treated as we were even at a budget hotel.On balance, the service I and my traveling companions receive outweighs beautifully appointed rooms, so we will not be choosing to stay with the Stephen F. Austin again, and frankly the entire InterContinental brand, whose corporate culture I now question, is now suspect to me, and I will be averse to staying at InterContinental properties entirely.In the future when visiting Austin, we will choose to stay in, and I now recommend to you, the Kimber, the W, the Hotel Saint Cecilia, or, if we want the feel of a grand old hotel, the Driskill, which is not only opulent, but boasts attentive and friendly service commensurate with the cost of the room, which the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin most assuredly and strikingly does *not*."
5,Excellent place to stay in Austin,"Great location on Congress St, this hotel has a lot to do within walking distance. Restaurants, Bars, Entertainment, its all there. Hotel's own restaurant Roaring Fork is one of the Top Rated restaurants in the city. Rightfully so, I might add."
5,GREAT location and very nice hotel,The InterContinental Stephen F. Austin is a great hotel! The hotel is located just a few moments walk away from all the DT action with all the restaurants and bars. The hotel staff was extremely welcoming and friendly at every interaction. I will definitely be back!
