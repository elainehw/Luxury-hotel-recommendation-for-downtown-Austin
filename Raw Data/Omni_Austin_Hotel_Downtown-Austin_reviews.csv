5,Wonderful Stay of Three Nights,"We recently stayed at the Omni for three nights and had a great experience. The hotel was lovely. Our room was lovely. Location worked perfectly for us. We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant, dinner at the hotel bar and breakfast one morning at the coffee location with their breakfast tacos. Omni had apples out one morning, a tee towel another, and cookies the night before the UT game. Everything was enjoyable except the valet parking cost which is the most we have paid in any city."
5,Nice Downtown Austin Experience,"My husband and I recently stayed in the Omni Austin Downtown during a 3 day business trip. We received a club level room on the 15th floor. The room included a small balcony with a nice view and a large bathroom with large walk in shower. The club access was a nice touch. The afternoon hors d'oeuvres included several hot choices along with other snacks, wine, beer, and liquor. The hotel itself felt slightly dated. However, overall it was a good choice being in a location central to lots of good bars and restaurants. The lobby bar was a nice place to unwind and the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. We self parked, which was very pricy...might as well just use the valet service."
2,Not worth the money,This hotel uses its name to get by. The rooms are subpar especially for the price. The elevators are always broken. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything all the time. Its just NOT worth the money.
5,Couldnt say it better than my 9 yo.,"My son wrote his summer report about his stay at the Omni and ended every sentance with ""and I had a great time!"". From scenic view from the roof top pool to the kind and welcoming staff you feel like kings and queen for the stay. Much appreciated break from the routine rat race!"
4,Customer service,Beautiful hotel. Clean and the staff was great. The hotel provided free umbrellas to guests which was great because it rained. The location was very good. We were able to walk to everything. I can't say enough about the staff. The door man was always there to open doors. Greatv
5,Austin for F1 race,"Checked in on the 31st of October 2019 for 5 nights, all the staff we interacted with at the hotel were superb from, reception, concierge, bar, restaurant and housekeeping. Very clean rooms, clean public areas"
3,Very average hotel,Nothing special about this hotel although staff were nice and location was good. My room was a decent size but just not laid out in a user friendly way and dated decor. I looked into the atrium. I found breakfast horribly cold and unwelcoming - it was a wintery cold night and morning and the atrium was freezing. Everyone was wearing their coats. Overall very average experience.
1,"Poor service, Outdated hotel","There was not much pleasant about my stay. First, I was confirmed for a king, however my husband and I were denied a king room. When we asked to speak to a manager, Graham told us that even though we were confirmed, the next night was sold out and they needed the kings for those guests and that since we were part of a group rate, our room type was not guaranteed. My email confirmation did not state that our room type was not guaranteed, only that we were confirmed for a king. Very poor explanation and left us feeling invaluable. My husband and I had to sleep separately.The room is in severe need of an update. Glass top desk means that the optic mouse does not work. I had to crawl under the desk to plug in my laptop as there were no easy access outlets on the desk. Had issues connecting to the wifi and had to make several calls to the front desk about it. The desk chair was creaking and uncomfortable. The bathtub was cracked and peeling.On our last day, we ordered breakfast to be delivered between 7 and 7:15. We called to confirm the order at 7:30 and the 'hostess' who answered had no idea about where our food was. The order finally showed up at 7:45.Overall, not a great experience at Omni Austin. I've stayed at many other Omnis and had much higher expectations. This hotel dropped the ball."
4,Nice Property...,"But you pay for it. Overall this is a nice property. But it's not cheap. Our room was clean but lacking in USB ports so some updating is in order. Right in dowtown so you can walk to a lot of places which we like and did. But again, be prepared to pay for it. Our room with 2 queen beds was close to $400 a nite after all the taxes were applied. It has a bar which we spent some time at. Grant, the one bartender was super nice. The one drink we had was delicious called the Tropicali. They also had a coffee kiosk (Morsels) which was great in the morning for us to get a specialty cup of coffee. If you have the money, it's not a bad place to stay."
5,Omni Austin Downtown,"Omni Hotel downtown Austin was convenient, the entire staff friendly and informative!! Rooms were a little outdated but clean. I would recommend to anybody!! I went to the roof top pool and the sights are amazing to look over Austin!!"
4,Building is nicer than the rooms,It was a typical nice Omni building but the rooms were outdated and overpriced. The location is okay - you can definitely walk to most everything - but the homeless people nearby were an eyesore. There were more in this area than we saw in any other area of Austin.
2,Disappointing Stay,"When I first checked in early to the hotel I was told my room was not ready, but that I would receive a text message once my room was available. After sitting around the hotel lobby for 4 hours, and never receiving a text message, I checked for myself with the front desk and found out my room had been ready for some time.About 30 minutes after getting to my room, and member of the hotel staff let himself into my room while I was in the room. He stated he needed to check the room's mini-bar, which was in complete disarray. After he looked quickly at the mini-bar he let himself out as well.The AC in the room was incredibly sub-par as well. While it was set to 60F, the room never came close to reaching that temperature. Leaving the room incredibly warm and uncomfortable during the night. This was made worse due to the hotel's design lacking exterior windows.Lastly, air flow & ventilation in the room in general was terrible. If someone took a hot shower for more than 5 minutes, the entryway walls were dripping with moisture from hot steam pouring out of the bathroom.In general, the quality of the room and my stay were WELL below my expectations for an OMNI property. For the price of this room, it was incredibly disappointing and I could not recommend anyone stay here."
3,Outdated and Overpriced,"The Omni-Austin: Hotel was musty, overpriced and the front desk was rude to say the least. No early check in and rooms weren’t even ready at check-in time. Ended up being moved due to front desk mistake for our requested adjoining rooms (reserved weeks in advance). For that price, stay at ZaZa or elsewhere. Never again!"
5,Location location,The Omni is the Omni. If you are new to the chain. They are all upscale and super nice. That was expected. The easy walk to the action of 6th street and the historic capitol building was a huge bonus. Wish I could have stayed longer.
4,"Good location, friendly staff","The hotel was clean and the staff is terrific. Very inviting. The restaurant was good. Good location in downtown Austin. No in house store for little toiletries, but there are a few within walking distance."
5,Great stay,"The rooms were very clean and spacious. The staff were very helpful and friendly. It didn't matter whom I spoke with, the entire staff went out of their way to help. I would highly recommend this hotel for business and family stays. It is very close to all the amenities which made exploring the city easy to do. Beautiful city as well."
3,"Excellent location for downtown, but very poor wifi","The hotel is newer with a pretty lobby. The service in the reception is not very good. By check in there was not given any information about the wifi. When you went online the only option was to pay an additional 9,95 USD for wifi. Back down to the reception they would work it out, but didn't. It was fixed after another visit to the reception, and then for free, which is what every cheap motel offers you. When we got online the wifi was very, very slow.The rooftop pool-area was a bit messy, most of the towels were used, the bar was not open (Friday-night).The room however was nice and everything there was nice and clean, and we had all the things we need.You can walk to almost every downtown sight from this hotel. The A/C worked fine, there was no noise from the streets, and check out worked just fine online."
5,"Great location, clean and nice hotel, comfy beds!","This was our second time to stay at the Omni. The location is awesome, walking distance to lots of restaurants and entertainment. The roof top pool is nice and the gym is perfect. Everything is very clean and the staff is very friendly."
5,Perfect game weekend location,The Omni is downtown Austin is the best place for a gameday weekend! Truly good value and freindly. Appreciate the good room size and service and quality of food. We love the walking locaation but not too loud to sleep at night.
1,"Overpriced, not as advertised, not Omni quality.","Make sure you call ahead to ensure you are getting a room that's the same quality as pictured on the website. The decor is extremely outdated accompanied by wear and tear, a tiny tv, and the shower was expected to be standing glass door shower (as pictured) instead we got one with a tub and old curtain."
2,One nighter. What a regret.,"My wife, daughter and I stayed in a room with dbl beds. That was crazy my wife and I trying to sleep in bed made for one person. The money you spend in a place like this should only have queen size beds as the smallest bed. I could tell this was a old hotel by the size of the room. SmallSo I will never stay in this over priced hotel. My mistake for thinking it was better than it was."
5,Great location!,Omni was beautiful! The location was perfect. We were there for just 1 night but had a great time. Walked across the street for a drink at the Driskall. Then ventured over to 6th street to have dinner at La Traviata and then some live music at the Darwin. So convenient to have Omni close to everything. Ja’Juan at the concierge desk gave us some super suggestions. Wonderful stay overall!
5,Great location and Hotel,This is an excellent choice when in Down Town Austin or attending an event at the Convention Center. Close to everything. The staff at this hotels goes above and beyond to help you in anyway needed. The hotel and room is very nice and the all around beauty of the property is exceptional.
4,Good base in Austin,"Great base in Austin, we had an executive suite which was very comfortable, clean and comfortable.TV didn’t work in bedroom, and while we logged the issue, the TV issue was never repaired during our stay, however the hotel did apologize and acted accordingly.The rooftop pool area had not been cleaned from the night before when we used the facility.The breakfast was good, plenty of choice on the buffet and staff were friendly.The bar did some nice snacks and good selection of beers and wine. Perfect for pre-dinner drinks.Close to all amenities and all Austin has to offer.One observation - the hotel is a little dated. Austin is a fast growing city with lots of competition now from newer, trendier hotels popping up.Perhaps we will will explore other options when we return to Austin to see what else is on offer."
5,Great all around.,"This hotel went way past the call of duty with me. I had chocolates upon arrival in my room in a mold the shape of Texas. Mmm delicious! They gave me bar drink vouchers and a bucket of beer to boot. I think all I did was respond to their e-mail asking me if I wanted anything so I simply said hello! They upgraded my room to a higher a floor too in an exclusive area? What didn't they do for me? In general the hotel is beautiful and located right off 6th. Perfect. The pool was relaxing, lunch buffet per pound quite easy too. I will more than likely choose this hotel over any other if I go to Austin again. It is also very reasonably priced. I found it great all around. Overall I highly recommend!"
5,A very nice Omni,"I was in town for a wk long conference. My room was nice and spacious and I had a nice view the 150+ yr old St. David's Episcopal church as well as other old bldgs. I was 5 block from my conference center and 5 blocks from the Capital. The staff - front desk, concierge, parking, were all friendly and helpful any time I had a question. The lobby itself was stately, yet welcoming w/plenty of chairs to sit. The gym was very good, in large part because It Had Room, the equip. wasn't crammed into a small room. You had the treadmills, stationary weight machines and plenty of free-weight to use. Overall it was a very nice hotel with a very helpful staff."
1,Not a good experience,Valet dinged my new car and I left my blow dryer and the cleaning staff “didn’t find it”. TV was to small for the price of the room and channel selection wasn’t good. Brought our Apple TV with us and they blocked that. We always take our Apple TV and don’t have this problem at other hotels. So overall the price of the stay isn’t worth it in my opinion.
4,Perfect downtown location,"Here for the first few days of our visit to the US. Hotel is in a great location for sights and restaurants. Concierge gave really useful ideas for trips and places to eat. We stayed in an executive floor room with separate living room (1501). Enjoyed the extra space and being on a high floor. We did have an issue with our TV mind you. One of the receptionists, I didn’t catch his name, really worked hard to resolve the issue and we appreciated the proactive approach. All round, recommend a stay here."
2,Too much noise,"I live in a bustling city and am very used to noise, however this is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. I can hear all of the people around me, as well as the street blaring music at 11pm. If you stay here I highly suggest getting a room on the inside. The noise level here is absolutely ridiculous. For the price, I am severely disappointed."
5,Just about perfect,"Convenient location, excellent local information provided at check-in (great map), very friendly staff, really comfy beds and very clean. Close to 6th Street for, better or worse (earplugs provided in case needed)."
5,OMG,"This hotel was AWESOME. When we arrived it was a slight mistake on the room, but Omni front desk staff came to the rescue. They upgraded our room and BOY-O-BOY it was an amazing room with an incredible view. The beds were soooooooo comfortable and it simply felt like home. And if you ask would we stay here again.......WITHOUT A DOUBT YES!"
3,"Great Location Hotel, Outside skyline Bar-pool (small and average, no restrooms near)","Went to meet my friend who is to be jumping the broom soon, we decided to stay at two different hotels for the WKND but stayed the first night at the Omni, parking was too much for valet $44, but across the street 15 dollars (park yourself if you like to save in this category-I do!). The room was clean and nice but small, comfy king bed, with a balcony, but the restroom walk-in shower was Excellent! No complaints. The room would be okay for two people sleeping but if you needed a rollway it would hardly fit between the bed and wall. Not a room to have guests. Then next hotel was Amazing in everyway but I'll leave it out of here."
2,Way overpriced for what you get,"I was originally stating at JW Marriot which prior to my husband joining me a few days later. I originally was out here for my scentsy reunion and shared the marriot with others. My husband picked the Omni to extend our trip based on all the amazing praise it got on hotel.com. I will say what they post there does not compare to what it is in person. Where do I begin.... we get here on Saturday and find out the valet parking is 44.00 a night or you can choose self parking for 32.00 a night, so really not much of a difference, then if you want breakfast brought to your room it is 22.00 for eggs, sausage or bacon and toast then you have to pay a 4.00 fee to have it brought up to your room. Are you kidding me I can cook that breakfast for around 10.00 and feeds family of 5..... our room was clean that's about all I can say for the room... then the pool area is on the roof direct sun the only shade is by the bar. No misters or fans running..come on its TX in the summer, then no bathrooms at the pool you have to walk down a few flights of stairs to the locker room you go to use the restroom and guess what the toilet is broke it wont flush... no out of order sign on the door so people still use it so I'm sure you can imagine. I have learned we will not be staying at an omni again and we still have one more night left."
5,Basically 5,"Beautiful place. Great location. No vending machines available at all for quick drinks are snacks. At check in we didnt get all the information we should have. Like how to get to the pool and any other services available. The room was nice but when asked for the sheets to be changed and the floor to be vacuumed then same sheets were put back on and I'm pretty sure the floor did not get vacuumed or if it did it was not well. There was only a mini fridge with lock on it in the room, so bringing leftovers home was out of the question if they couldnt sit out. Other than those few things we had a good time at a nice hotel."
1,Omni cancelled my reservation without notice and did not validate my parking,"My reservation was cancelled and nobody contacted me. Apparently my credit card authorization did not go through due to an error. I showed up to check in and this was the first I heard of the cancellation. There were no rooms left for the night and in fact they told me that had oversold rooms and had ""negative four"" rooms available. They offered to find me a room at a different Omni. All the rooms they offered were more expensive than the one I had booked - why not at least price match for my inconvenience? Then I asked to have my parking validated and the staff member told me I wouldn't have to pay for parking because I was only there for 15 minutes. He was wrong, I did have to pay for parking in the garage on top of all of this."
5,Great Stay,"Recent stay at this hotel for business. The location was within easy walking distance of the lake, 6th st, and many good restaraunts. The hotel had very comfortable beds and good size rooms. I had no problems with noise, but earplugs were available. I would return to this hotel because the staff was so friendly and helpful."
5,Birthday Getaway,"As alway, The omni Downtown Austin didn""t disappoint..The service was top notch, from Bell Boy to Housekeeping..The shower is nice & big and they have good lighting in the bathroom...We stayed as alway on the Club Level and loved the perks that comes with the booking on that level..Our hostess for Happy Hour was very attentive to everyone needs.."
4,"Clean rooms, great stuff, small and very dirty roof pool","As I mentioned on my title, the hotel is clean, huge, and the stuff is welcoming and great. The room was medium but very clean, the same as the bathroom. The roof pool (one of the reasons we chose this hotel) is small, crowded and very dirty, I am sure they are not cleaning it every night, but they need to start. The hotel is placed close to many restaurants, shops and of course in infamous 6th street. Parking is $47, park somewhere else for way cheaper."
4,Nice hotel in downtown Austin,"Great hotel in downtown Austin, ideal for business travellers - lots of things to do in the evening as you’re a short walk from 6th Street which comes alive around 8pm.Hotel gym is well equipped so if you’re a business traveller trying to get some exercise in too you won’t be too disappointed. Cardio machines, some resistance machines and dumbbells up to 50lbs."
4,Clean but warm rooms,"The service was phenomenal. Everyone was very helpful and quite willing to help. The food provided for our conference was actually flavorful and plentiful. The view I had in my room was just gorgeous. The bar staff was friendly, though the drink prices were a little high (this is to be expected in most hotel bars). The hotel was very accommodating given that many of us were arriving at strange times from the airport.The room was quite comfortable. The bathtub was amazing, nice and deep. The beds were very comfortable. There were plenty of pillows on the bed (though they are on the softer side).There was plenty of things to do around the hotel, including multiple fantastic restaurants. The hotel rests just on Old 6th street and while there are several homeless people sleeping on the streets I never get uncomfortable walking down to 6th street from the hotel or walking back to the hotel. Honestly the homeless were very patient and willing to take no for an answer.The only “complaint” I have is that I could never get the room cold. This wasn’t just a problem in my room but I’m almost everyone’s room I had talked to during conference. Though to be fair, Austin was hotter than Hades on the Fourth of July.This was definitely a wonderful stay and I cannot thank the staff enough for the patience, understanding, and willingness to work with our group."
5,"Gorgeous Property, Amazing Staff","I stayed at the Downtown Omni for a long weekend girls trip. The property was beautiful, in close proximity to the go to bars and restaurants - not to mention the amazing rooftop pool. The staff was friendly and attentive. Madison at the front desk gave us great live music recommendations and places to go as we were first time visitors. We stayed on the 9th floor from the 18th to 21st and the housekeeping team was phenomenal. The attention to detail was much appreciated. Would recommend this property to anyone staying in Austin on business or for pleasure."
3,Adequate accommodations not a 4star quality experience,"Accommodations were adequate, clean but outdated and very worn.I received a fantastic deal so I would only recommend this hotel for a low price. Had I paid normal prices this would review would be far more negative. But I am satisfied with our stay for the price.Our shower was broken upon arrival and had to be repaired while we were in the room. We had to request our room be cleaned at 4pm and again at 8pm. It was finally done around 9pm.The room was clean, it had fabulous NEST products, and it was quiet at night. Internet was spotty and I kept loosing the signal.We had difficulty using uber due to the construction outside the hotel. Trips were cancelled once the driver saw the horrendous traffic to get in.There is a large homeless population downtown and surrounding the Omni is no exception. The downtown location was great for walking to congress bridge, river activities, and good food and coffee locations.I do not recommend in room food or coffee service. I would use uber eats and higher quality from the nearby shops if you aren’t up for going out.They were able to hold our bags on our day of departure which was a great service for us. But It was 100 degrees out and there is no water bottle fill station. Which is absurd considering the Eco friendly vibe of Austin."
3,Great Staff - Get Maintenance Done!!!!,"The staff were all polite and friendly.My room was on the 16th floor, but the elevator that serviced the upper floors wasn't working. The effort to get there via the other elevators was a huge hassle. Also, apparently the TVs are fed via a satellite - the stations kept going out, which was very annoying. The toilet in my room was clogged upon arrival - are you kidding me???"
3,Decent,"Pros:-Clean, large bathrooms-Convenient location-In-house parking that's convenient-Nice facilities in generalCons:-Pillows are not comfortable (so beware if you have neck/spine issues like me)-No 24-hour menu for room service. A lot of other hotels offer this.-Menus for room service are pretty limited"
4,More like a 3.75 but not a solid 4,"Stayed 2 nights (Fri & Sat) in June for a girlfriends birthday weekend. We were originally booked at the Aloft but switched because there was no pool there and the Omni rooftop pool seemed pretty enticing!*Location: great for hitting up 6th street! Literally 2 blocks away. That being said, you definitely get the noise (music, cops) and lights (cops) depending which way your room faces.*Room: Clean, traditional with average bathroom. Wish it would have had a separate shower…shower curtains freak me out. A very nice surprise was the Nest bathroom products, my fave!*Pool: Cool concept having a rooftop pool but it was literally the size of a hot tub with a slick metal bottom. Super crowded, no available chairs, but great views. Beware when you enter the pool via the stairs, there’s an ill-placed pool grate/cover that left me with a black and blue toe.Would I stay here again? Maybe. It was just an average stay but the price was right and the location was super."
4,Good solid Hotel and value for the price,"This hotel is located in the heart of the downtown area. It was very close to my office and to a bunch of restaurants, bistros and bars. The rooms are always very nice, clean and updated. I always try to stay here whenever possible."
4,"Nice, but...","For the price of a suite, I expected more. A regular room would probably have been a better deal. No microwave or fridge and we had babies with us. So bottle time was a bit inconvenient. However, the staff was great, nice hotel but location is not the best."
3,Ehh..My second stay here..may be my last,"The French toast was very good at the lobby restaurant. The concierge was very helpful. The front desk clerk who assisted us in our check out was very accommodating and genuinely seemed to care about an issue we had with several very loud neighboring guests. We loved the fruit infused water in the lobby each day.The view from the rooftop pool & bar is beautiful.The beds are VERY comfortable.· I think it might be time to update the hotel. It is nice, but it is dated and could be updated to more of a current décor throughout the hotel.The rooftop pool is very small but nice, after you climb 2 flights of stairs to get to it - NOT HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE even though it does have a handicap pool lift. Any guests with physical disabilities would have to be carried up 2 flights of stairs to enjoy the pool. Get out there early to get a chairs together. The pool was filthy also.There are 2 bottles of water on the dresser in the rooms, with no indication as to whether they are complimentary or if you will be charged for consuming them. It would be helpful to have a sign indicating either or. We opted for sink water just to be sure we weren't being charged for the bottled water (which are $6 each at the Omni Ft Worth).Starting from when they checked in on Friday, there was a group of guests who occupied 4 of the rooms across from our room. They were constantly slamming doors as they went back and forth from room to room. Yelling up and down the hall day and night. Obviously, they didn't notice the large sign by the elevators indicating the hotel had a strict NO PARTY POLICY. There were so many people coming and going from the rooms across from ours. It was very hard to relax with so much noise. When we finally called the front desk at 12:00am Saturday night, we assume a call was made to their room, because it quieted down. 2 neighboring guests next to us had already gone out in the hall and asked the group to be quiet, but we didn't notice anything change until we called down to the front desk.The rooms need more 'Working' power outlets. They have mounted small power strips to the desk and 1 nightstand. My husband's phone was plugged into the desk power strip on his charger the first night so he could play his fan app. His phone battery died while plugged in overnight and took forever to charge for the day exploring Austin. More than half the television channels did not come in clear or even at all."
4,Great hotel,"Stayed here for a birthday celebration. The quality of service, friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the hotel was excellent. Great location downtown. Within walking distance of 6th street and other major points downtown. Rooms were quiet and beds were comfortable. The only issue I had was trying to connect to wifi. My son connected just fine, but I had issues (could have been my phone services). Overall - it was a great experience."
5,Austin Getaway,"This was a much needed getaway for us. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend the Omni to anyone. The interior design is truly amazing, and the staff is absolutely the best . We cannot wait for our next visit."
5,Austin Omni Hotel Downtown,Service from Staff was top notched from check in to check out. Would stay in an other Omni whenever available. I had neverev stayed at an omni and I am very pleased that i took a chance to stay at this facility.
4,Steps Away from Congress & 6th,"I have explored all the hotels downtown Austin except the Omni Downtown, so this was the day to explore the hotel lobby. I walked up from 6th Street and found the doors locked. It turned out I had to walk around the building to enter. I noticed it was actually two buildings connected by a square glass atrium. I finally walked into the right doors to find a very large indoor space. Omni hotels always have that luxurious feel and this location was no different.I decided to walk around noticing people checking out at the registration desk since it was very early in the morning. There was nice seating all around with guest drinking coffee and eating breakfast tacos. I found a coffee stand serving fresh Peet’s Coffee and selling breakfast tacos. I only got a coffee and found a place to sit. There was a bar which was not open yet with table seating but found a comfy couch.In looking around the place had a nice decor and watch the elevator go up 200 feet to the top of the glass atrium. The place is very bright due to the natural sunlight. I could see the hotel internal architecture where on one side was an office building and the other the Omni Hotel. It felt so open in here and relaxing.I saw a small gift shop in the lobby to purchase items you forgot at home. I stayed about 30 minutes until headed to my conference, but will remember to return to this nice hotel either to grab a breakfast taco or drink at the bar."
4,Great Location!,"I was visiting Austin and chose this place because of the ideal location to the downtown night life. The hotel has very late check-in (I got in from my flight around midnight) and had no problems checking-in. They have a no visitor policy after 10:30 pm which is helpful in controlling the volume on the floors. Honestly I didn't hear much noise, but if there was any noise it was very faint from the other hotel guests. So the hotel offers free Wifi, however, you have to signup to become an Omni Hotel member to get the free Wifi. The Wifi was hard to connect to at times, thus why I'm giving this review a 4/5 stars. When I was checking out I was told I had 2 charges for internet usage, but I explained that there was a problem with the internet and I had signed up to be an Omni member and they waived the charges from my bill. The downtown area was less than a 10 minute walk, but be careful around the area and in Austin in general. Many homeless people that are constantly coming up to you asking for money. It became a really annoying.The staff were really friendly and amazing. The room was immaculate and huge -- great view of the rest of Austin from my room.Also note: when you become an Omni member there are other amenities that become complimentary in your room, like the water and whatnot.I would stay here again."
5,Amazing place,Hands down one of the best hotels I've stayed at. Great costumer services with an amazing rooftop bar that has an even better bartender Gabby B. Ask for one of her signature drinks they are delicious.
5,Great Hotel in the center of Austin,Clean and high quality hotel. The staff was very friendly. Nice rooftop bar. Pool could be bigger and newer. But the view makes up for that. Room was great. Pillows a little too soft for my taste and the tv could be upgraded. I’m just complaining about those things because there wasn’t really anything bad about this hotel. I’ll go there again next time I come through Austin!
2,No Charging Ports,"I booked an Executive Suite and there was no where to charge my phone, tablet or smart watch. They really need to update the technology in these rooms. I don't recommend spending the extra money on an inadequate suite."
5,Five star experience,"Even though we just stayed for a night, this was one of our best experiences at a hotel. From early checkin, off menu food items, to late checkout, the staff went out their way to accommodate my family’s requests. Thank you!! Great location, superb value."
5,No detergent allergy reaction here!,"For anyone who has a severe detergent allergy like me, I always pack my own sheet and blanket just in case but here I didn’t need to unpack it. No reaction whatsoever. Will stay at Omni Hotels now that I know this! No reaction to sheets or towels. What a nice change! Thank you!"
5,Very Nice Hotel / Great Location,This is a very nice hotel - I was there for a family event and some of the family stayed at the Westin down the street. The Omni in my opinion is a nicer hotel and more economical than the Westin. The only negative is the parking is $34 a day which is comparable to other hotels in the area I assume - just be sure you budget this into your trip when looking for hotels in the downtown Austin area.
5,Beautiful and great location!,"This hotel was centrally located and the staff was friendly and had great advice for recommendations on food and kayaking. We basically walked everywhere after we parked, so it was certainly convenient. We will definitely stay here again next month and recommend this hotel. The restaurant did have a great breakfast."
4,Nice Stay,"Recently visited Austin, TX and stayed 2 nights at the Omni. It was an enjoyable stay. We stayed in an Executive Suite, very spacious and comfortable. Room was clean and updated. Staff was very friendly. Location is good, super close to all the bars and restaurants.The bar at the pool was only open once which was a bit of a let down. WiFi at the hotel is poor."
5,One Night Stay,"Hotel emailed before arrival for my travel plan arrival time and said they would hold the room. It is located somewhat away from the downtown happenings, yet that was not important for this trip. The ambience was hip and the room decor was perfect."
3,Mixed review,"My husband and I were in town for the races, our first trip to Austin. The service was great. We elected for $15 each per day to do the breakfast and happy hour. It’s well worth it! The host or hostess was always very accommodating, although the only red wine they had for 5 nights was Pino noir which my husband doesn’t like so he had a mixed drink each evening. The appetizers were always sufficiently filling.. we enjoyed it. Parking in the building is $30 per day. Also, the water pipes were loud.. when the patrons next door were in the shower we knew it... the loud pipes woke us up early."
2,"Looks pretty, staff is friendly, but has issues","This looks like a nice hotel, it looks very pretty and it's in a nice area of town. However, you'll be terribly disappointed by the internet connectivity. My room smelled like a wet dog. There is loud music that is played nearby that can be heard in all of the guest rooms. Bring your ear plugs."
5,Nice Omni,"Probably my second or third stay here for business. Nice location and literally a few blocks from my worksite. This time was put into a newer suite and it was beyond comfortable. The welcome amenity was very nice. Staff made great efforts to show appreciation and make my stay wonderful. Food in the concierge was awesome and the EVENING attendant there was absolutely the the nicest, sweetest and most attentive person. She was amazing. It truly was a great stay!"
5,One Night Honeymoon,Amazing stay and staff. Complimentary upgrade for honeymoon and concierge desk went above and beyond. Easy check in/out process and extremely clean from guests room to lobby. We will be staying here again.
4,Great location and nice hotel,Great place for a girl trip. The pool is not huge but fun. The pool bar should open at noon however on Fridays. The coffee bar had breakfast items. Great for me people like me who do not do big breakfasts. Our room was clean but the hotel is showing it’s age. Self park is $32 a day but that’s normal downtown. Always felt safe and the staff was very helpful. Love the Nest products in the room
5,Omni,"Booked Omni as our base for a few days. The hotel is lovely!! The staff are amazing . The desk staff, and Mark were extremely helpful in some papers I needed to be faxed urgently. There’s a rooftop pool with perfect temperature water. Very quiet at night . Comfortable room with a nespresso machine for morning coffee. 2 blocks from congress street with tons of restaurants and some shopping.I would stay here again."
5,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel was fantastic from the check in to the departure, everything was perfect. The room was quiet and the bed was super comfortable. The elevators were always available. We even had a great view of Austin. I would definitely stay there again."
3,My stay- 3 days,Restaurant menu was very limited and opening hours not good for travelers or for a conference. I have stayed a better hotels at half the price.Lots of homeless people around the perimeter of the hotel and they approach you wanting money
4,Great location,The Omni downtown is a great location and the service is impeccable but they need to make some upgrades to the rooms. Make them more tech friendly for smart devices. Also bathroom could use a few updates like towel hooks
4,"Great for business, close to downtown action",Stayed here 2 nights for business. Spacious suite on 18th floor had great views. Location 1 block from 6th St is fantastic but there is a fair amount of street noise (think Bourbon St in New Orleans.) Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine!
3,"Nice location, dingy hotel.",Although the Omnis in the past have been nice upscale places to stay this location was a huge disappointment for the price. It’s a great location literally 2 blocks from E 6th but the floors of the entire hotel are stained and old. The rooms are dingy and desperately need to be modernized. I felt like I was staying in an over priced motel 6. The lobby was nice but still had old carpet throughout which was gross. Was not worth the money. Next time we will stay at a newer hotel (there were several 3 star at the same price point that were actually newer but we wanted a 4 star)
5,Scotts 50th birthday.,I took my husband to Austin for his 50th birthday.It was a fine stay. We both travel a lot for business and the Omni in any location doesn't disappoint which is why I chose this location for our stay
3,It's expensive!,"I was very surprised by the cost of the hotel and perhaps even more surprised when I arrived and found out how slightly above average most things were. The rooms were nice and clean, but far from what I expected given the cost. Nice location, but also very close to the homeless shelter. I have stayed in much nicer hotels, for considerably less."
3,Tired Hotel with Good Service,"I stay at the Omni Downtown quite frequently due to business meetings that are always held there. The service is always friendly and very good. But for the price, the rooms are tired and the hotel desperately needs renovation."
1,"Small Rooms, Hard Beds, Bad Shower, Poor Internet","The title should say it all.For the price of the room it should be a great experience. Not poor.Our room was small as a Motel 6 and kind of felt like one.The bed was super stiff/hard. I had a hard time getting out of bed because my back hurt so much. The shower was broke and when trying to make it warmer, something in valve would click and switch to pure hot water. Damn near scalded myself and my wife."
3,Work and Play Combo WIth the Family,"I just finished a four (4) night stay here in late April. The hotel shares a large lobby atrium with a business tower. In the middle is a bar and restaurant.The highlights of the hotel are as follow: (1) Very good food in the hotel lobby restaurant (Anchos). This consists of a breakfast buffet for $22.00 per person which includes an option to order eggs/omelette cooked to order, bacon/sausage, fruit, cereal, coffee, juice, etc. If you are traveling with children under 5, they eat free which is a plus. In addition, there lunch buffet is very good as well and only $17.00 per person.(2) There roof top pool is fun if you have children who need to release some energy.(3) If you decide to stay at an Omni Hotel, I recommend signing up for their loyalty program. You receive free internet and beverage service. This includes a free drink at the bar per night, or delivered coffee to your room in the morning for up to 2 people.(4) The hotel is also centrally located and close to lots of bars and restaurants on 6th Street.The negatives: (1) While the hotel's website notes that it is kid friendly, the hotel check-in staff must not have been properly trained on the associated kid's amenities. We had to ask for the kids back pack with activities that should have been provided on check-in and my son never received milk and cookies on the first night's turndown service as touted in the hotel's website. There is no excuse of hotel check-in employees not knowing their own amenities listed on their website and not offering same to patrons upon check-in.(2) We stayed in a one-bedroom suite on the 18th floor. The space was nice, but the décor was 10 to 15 years dated. In addition, even though we stayed in a suite, we were told that club level access (smaller rooms) would cost an additional $30 per person per night. This is a prime example of a company not understanding the needs of its customers. When families travel, they like the extra space that a suite provides so everyone makes it back alive. In addition, families with children appreciate the convenience of a club level to provide small children with options for morning and early evening snacks (without purchasing an entire meal that kids will likely not eat). Failing to provide club level standard to families reserving suites is a severe oversight in my opinion.(3) The elevator situation is atrocious. If you stay in a suite or club level, only two of the hotel's four elevators will take you to your floors. When we were there, only one elevator worked. This caused many patrons to have to wait for up to 20 minutes for an elevator. This is poor planning which should have been corrected years ago. I say that because the elevators to the businesses in the lobby work (6 total) work flawlessly.(4) Prior to checking out, I received an emailed bill which include a $50.00 charge for complimentary beverage service. While it was removed without question, that should never occur on a patron's bill. Again, I believe this relates to a lack of proper training of the hotel's staff.(5) While the 18th floor is supposed to be secure since it requires hotel key access, on one morning, a drunk college kid was passed out in the chair next to the elevator on the 18th floor. When traveling with children, this is unacceptable. The person was only removed after I had to report his issue directly to the front desk.Overall, if I plan another trip to Austin in the future, I would likely choose a hotel closer to the river and Congress bridge. There are many quality options in that area and that part of the city is beautiful."
4,Location Location Location,"Yes, this Omni is nicely situated, 1.5 blocks from the action on 6th street.The rooms are good. My particular room had some noticeable wear and tear on the walls and the air conditioning vent was loose/making some noise. Overall, it was a good spot and a comfortable bed.That all said, the bathroom was exceptional, specifically the shower. It was huge! I always appreciate a true shower (versus the tub shower). Does anyone actually take a bath in a hotel? At any rate, kudos on the massive shower. I would stay here again."
5,Great location!,"Located within walking distance of many restaurants and night life!Close enough to 6th Street, but far enough to sleep peacefully ; )We arrived four hours prior to check in but were given a room right away!"
5,Location location location,Great hotel. $$$ but worth it. 2 blocks off congress. Comfy beds. Very nice front desk staff. Gave us $25 gift card to 3 forks and made ressy for us. Coffee bar in lobby should be open longer. Would stay again.
4,"Nice location and room, mixed feelings","The Omni is a very good location near the capital and downtown area. Lots of restaurants and music nearby and the trail along the river is close too. It was a hassle to get into the hotel with all the one-way streets, parking garage and traffic. The parking is pricey even if you park yourself and the room is pretty expensive too but Austin is not cheap. No included breakfast but Voodoo Donuts is nearby! The room was classy and comfortable."
5,Design Experience,"Great location, and ease of access. Beds a super and fitness center too. The fish tacos were great and soothed the late days hunger.Friendly staff, easy to talk with and helped guide you along the way. Not too sure about renting a scooter without a helmet though."
5,Great Hotel Experience,"I think the location of my room made for a little greater than average noise. There were earplugs- I choose to not use them as I didn't want to miss my alarm. It wasn't an intolerable amount of noise, just didn't make for great rest. My room was lower and faced 6th Street on a Saturday nite. I was doomed for noise."
5,Favorite Austin Hotel for Business,This hotel is right in the middle of downtown usually reasonably priced and has a great atrium with hotel rooms overlooking the inside. I stay here every time I am in Austin or business. I would definitely stay again.
4,Nice but pricey,"Very decent hotel but on the high end of the price scale in my world. Rooms are decent but certainly not luxurious. Food and beverage service (lounge and restaurant) are very good, and the food is wonderful if a bit narrow in choice. Location for downtown activities is excellent and the staff couldn't be much better."
5,Work and Play,"Great stay. Bed slept great, so great I overslept one day! All staff was very prompt, polite and helpful. The bell man with the dred locks is the greatest asset to your team! He remembers names days later and was excited to assist!"
4,Good value,Property was dated but this was mitigated by the offering of breakfast and an evening happy hour. Outstanding rooftop pool with expansive views of Austin area. Workout center was also a plus. Walking distance to all downtown attractions / restaurants.
5,Nice place,Rooms where nice. Had an issue with AC not working. Let front desk know and they had it fixed and running within 20 minutes. Appetizers and breakfast on upper floors was a wonderful touch. Nice to go it of the room and down the hallway for snacks and light meals.
4,Solid property - no problems,"From check in to check out everything was smooth- which is really all you need on a quick business trip. I didn't leverage any amenities except a quick drink in the bar. Front desk service was welcoming and efficient, room was clean and comfortable and equipped with everything I needed. Quick uber ride or 10 min walk to convention center."
5,Wonderful staff,"We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here at the Omni downtown. The room was nice....an unbelievably comfortable bed. Great location. But the nicest part is the staff. Everyone has been so nice, so courteous, and so helpful. The restaurant has really good food. The bar is nice. All around a wonderful experience. I can’t say enough nice things about the people who work here—from the cleaning staff, to the waiters, the clerks, the concierge, and the guys who work outside the front as the cars come in and out. All went above and beyond."
5,Great Stay,Hotel staff was very accommodating. There was a mix up in my room so they gave me an upgrade and it was absolutely amazing. Close to 6th Street and the Capital. I could see 6th street from my balcony. Definitely recommend!
5,Business Conference - Outstanding!!,Stayed here for the first time to attend a business conference. Everything was Outstanding!! Guest Room was quiet and Conference Room was perfect for the daily sessions!! And the breakfast and lunch buffet meals were so tasty; especially since I love Southwestern and Tex-Mex style food!! Will definitely consider staying here in the future when on personal travel!!
5,Thank you!,"Great stay! Thanks for a great time. Nice clean rooms. Beautiful bar area. Nice business meeting rooms and service. Nice location, easy walk to night life. Door men are awesome! I even got a ""Go Hawks!"" from one of them on my arrival."
4,"Average quality, helpful staff","I was here for a conference. In general, the hotel is clean and acceptable for night stay.- Location: convenient with access to many quality local and chain bars and restaurants.- Amenities: acceptable. Restaurant, bar, gym. Didn’t check the pool though.-sleeping quality: the room was pretty quiet to me (no problem in that sense), but it was facing the complex lobby which was bright all the time. The curtains don’t provide enough coverage. So, it can be problematic especially if you are sensitive to light.-privacy: I could hear people walking and speaking outside of the room. Also, you can hear neighbor rooms bathroom flush, shower and if they hit the walls or move stuff in the room. Didn’t hear people speaking in the room though! It hurts the sense of privacy.Check-in and check-out: check-in was fairly uneventful, and the staff were polite and helpful.-special comment: I want to specially thank Alexis (one of the managers) who helped with my reservation. I booked through booking.com. But the day before check-in, I realized that my booking (although confirmed by booking.com) has never gone through the hotel. Traveling to Austin in the spring break vacation time which is a super busy season, I was so frustrated because there was nothing else available. After several hours phone call with booking.com and back and forth with the hotel, Alexis helped to create a new reservation with the same description as I did through booking.com and confirmed it. I am specially gracious to her help. And one lesson that I learned: “beware of booking.com. Their transaction system is not so organized. So, whenever you choose to book through them, follow-up with the hotel and make sure that everything is fine. Also, strongly discourage last minute reservations through booking.com since it can cause chaos.”Please review my photos of the room to understand the quality and location better."
5,Great stay,"Great location, friendly staff and an overall great stay. Room was,spacious and had I nice view. Rooftop pool is small but has a nice surrounding area. Staff was available to answer all our questions and helped when our key didn’t work and promptly brought a toothbrush when my son forgot his. I would recommend this hotel."
5,Spring Break Weekend Getaway,"Omni first-timer and will definitely return! Stayed two nights over Spring Break with my college age son to explore Austin and loved it! Great location, friendly service, beds are beyond comfy and cleanliness is top notch!"
4,Pricy with bad mattress,"One of the beds in our room needed to be replaced. My husband slept horrible he's 6'5 and weighs pounds.Told the front desk clerk and manager whike checking out they didn't seem to care. Just said i take note if that. For $309 a night ...he should've slept like king.Overall hotel was nice, check was easy, valet was fast, and close to 6th street and Capitol.I would stay again!"
4,British review of the omni,"Stayed in this hotel after a very last minute booking whilst travelling around Texas.The hotel is very clean spacious and nice. The room size was great for 2 people and the rooftop pool area was a nice touch.The rooms are of an older style but were not run down or dated.The location is also within short walking distance to 6th street and the bridge to where the bats are.The only downside to the omni is the overpriced cost to park your vehicle. About $33 dollars a night so this mounts up when staying for an extended period of time. The parking area however is secure.Would rate 5 stars for hotel , 4 because of the parking."
3,No Water Pressure,"We recently stayed at the Omni and had problems with the water from the day we arrived. The first night we stayed, we woke up to water pouring out of the toilet, both the back of the tank and the tube coming out of the wall that connects to the toilet. It did eventually stop. That morning I took a shower and as soon as the shampoo went in, all water pressure went to a dribble. I cut off and on several times. It did eventually come back up to a slow stream so I could rinse my hair. I went downtstairs to tell the front desk about the shower and the toilet problems. They added us to a long maintenance list. No one ever came to the room that day to check. The following day, the toilet once again started pouring water all over the floor. So maintenance did finally come and repaired the toilet. However, every single shower I took while I was there for 4 days, had times where the water would completely stop coming out. Also a super loud noise would come from the wall. I'm guessing something is wrong with their pipes, but I'm not sure. Water would also stop coming out of the sink faucet.Everything else about the stay was fine, clean room, friendly staff (though not really that concerned with our water situation), and really great breakfast. Also a great location right in the middle of downtown."
4,"Clean, friendly staff, weird entrance policy, nothing special","It all went fairly smoothly, from the check-in all the way to the check-out. Concierge was very helpful the couple of times I had questions or needed something. The rooms were decently sized and clean (although weirdly facing the inner part of the building, where lights are kept on all night), but not special in any way. They have an old flat screen TV (around 32"" or 40"") which they kept turning on everyday (I don't understand what's this trend hotels do lately to have the TV On when you walk into the room... it's annoying).My biggest complaint has to do with the hotel closing all entrances to the building except for the main one. The building has nice entrances on different sides (in fact, the more convenient side is the closer to 6th), but all are closed and one has to walk around the block to go in."
4,"Great stay, clean rooms","I stayed at this hotel for five days on business. The hotel staff was very welcoming, the check-in process was smooth, and the room was one of the cleanest I’ve seen lately. The hotel is a little outdated with decor and technology- updates are needed for a better experience. Free and working WiFi, usb charging, and a refrigerator are all things I come to expect in a modern hotel, especially on a club floor. Noise doesn’t bother me- it’s the city and all hotels have thin walls. I enjoyed the club floor’s free breakfast and appetizers as well as the complimentary beverage service. Overall, a nice experience."
4,"The hotel is nice, club level not really worth it","Have stayed at this Omni several times over the years and it is a nice place with friendly staff. Hadn’t booked club level before, so tried it this time. Breakfast - stick to breads, bagels, pastries, fruit...the “hot” egg selections were not remotely warm and the bacon and sausage way over cooked both mornings. The evening choices were a little better and they do serve wine/beer/cocktails, but again, not really worth the extra add-on.Self-parking is $32/night, but is is in the heart of downtown Austin - good location.I’ll come back, but won’t spend extra for club level."
4,Friendly service,"The downtown Austin Omni is well located for downtown meetings and access to SoCo and West Campus. We enjoyed a club room on the 14th floor where the lounge had nice beverages and snacks. All the staff was very friendly at the front desk and in the club lounge. The rooms were clean and up to the high standards commonly found in Omni hotels. The parking situation makes this a challenging place to return in the future, as the hotel shares a garage with an office building. No spaces were available, so we valet parked for $47 per day. A little high for Austin, so be prepared. We opted to UBER everywhere given the parking challenges."
4,Great Hotel,"Excellent and accomodating staff, good hotel, comfortable and clean room. Spacious conference rooms with great WiFi. Surroundings of the hotel not very safe to walk at night, but overall, it was good."
1,Deserves no rating,The staff isn’t welcoming and they have a very negative attitude. Worse experience I have ever had at any hotel never plan to stay at a Omni ever again. Watch out for the credit card you place on file they will charge anything and obscene amounts of money. Didn’t even use valet yet I was charged a valet overnight fee.
4,Great but no coffee available prior to 7AM,"Staff in all areas very friendly and accommodating. Great location. The room was a bit dated but beds were comfortable. Since the Pete’s Coffee stand is not open until 7AM, there should probably be some made available elsewhere within the lobby for early risers."
5,Restful Get Away!,Friendly staff! Very comfortable beds and pillows. Quite! Good food at the restaurant. They even gave us a late checkout with no harge! Thank you!! Great location too!Can’t think of anything else to say😘
5,Great location,"Great location, walking distance to so may great places. 6th ave is full of great bars and restaurants. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They were able to guide us around town to some great shopping areas."
3,Overpriced but great beds,The hotel beds are awesome. Just know that every service used will cost more than what is qouted by staff or listed on the website. These fees can mount when using multiple services. Parking should be reduced or free for hotel quests with the amount you pay per night for rooms.
1,Needs a makeover!,"Traveled to Austin for business and had to stay in downtown for my visit.I usually stay at Westin’s or Marriott’s but those hotels had no availability.I booked the Omni downtown because it was available and I have had good experiences at other Omni hotels around the country.The poor review is due to the overall condition of the hotel, it is very dated and in desperate need of a makeover.I will say that everything in this hotel needs updating- the lobby, the hotel restaurant, the carpets, the elevators, the rooms, the bathrooms, the paint, the window treatments, the TV’s, and the ventilation system.Also,Some of the costs are very high- for instance overnight parking is $44 per day and that is very high, there are plenty of parking lots adjacent to the hotel that you can use.Recommendation-If you need to stay in downtown Austin go to another hotel until the Omni updates this location."
4,Good business hotel in central location,"Stayed for three nights, Hotel offers all the typical needs for business travelers.- Keurig Coffee maker and Pads in room, functional bath and comfortable bed and reasonably good wifi. Safe, Minibar (pricing not checked)- For private stay I don’t like the dark brown colored furniture and the business hotel flair.- Friendly and helpful staff- wait for elevator at peak time- Due to the fact that multiple Bars, Restaurant are very close by, I would recommend to have breakfast outside."
5,"Great location, service and experience!","We greatly enjoyed our stay at Omni. Location was perfect, right downtown within walking distance to everything. Staff was very accommodating and friendly and had great recommendations. We upgraded and received breakfast and appetizers, drinks which were also very nice. Bed was very comfortable as was room. Would highly recommend!"
4,Omii Austin downtown,"this hotel is in great local for Austin and the downtown area, close to the hill when legislature in session and close to some great places to eat and entertainment always available in the area and is a strength of this city!"
2,Joke,Watch out for manager Graeme. He has 4 whole years of hotel experience and will let you know that to ensure you that you are wrong as a guest. Keep an eye on your credit card statement because they will charge it without telling you.
5,Couldn't be happier!,"I stayed on property for a business trip. From the moment I arrived on the front drive to check out the staff was very accommodating, friendly and efficient. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. And the location couldn't be better! Right downtown and a block from 6th street."
5,1st time staying at the Omni,"The only thing was the freshly cleaned restroom in my room. It had a strong odor of bleach and other cleaning materials. I aired it out a bit. Other than that, i had a great first experience there. I will definitely stay there again in the future."
1,If you like,"Full sized beds, outdated rooms and bad service come here! We reserved a king sized bed but the “manager” could not figure out how to get us in the room with the king sized bed because my husband was staying on with business!!?!? Yes staying longer and overspending linger at this hotel?!? So while there was a king sized bed available and he was willing to change rooms after I left they couldn’t figure out how to make it happen! We should have stayed at the Westin and he could have joined his work after the trip. Rooms are beat up! I would not recommend or every stay here again."
2,Need updates,"Room rates were different for me and my colleague.My first room had a broken heater. The room was loud and cold. The thermostat did not work.I complained to the guest services, they said they would fix it during the day and call me to let me know the status.No one called me. Guest services said the heater was fixed upon my arrival in the evening. When I went up to my room I found out that it wasn’t. I tried calling to the guest services, phone didn’t work.Came downstairs, I was given another room. No help was offered to help me transfer my luggage to the other room. My original room was on the 14th floor, new one was on the executive levels. Needed a different elevator. A lot of up and down after a tiring work day."
5,Terrific service,"The staff are friendly, efficient and professional. The catering staff were appropriately interactive and fun whiledoing their jobs very well. The housekeeping team was equally helpful and kind spirited. Very impressed with the hotel amenities and location. Will be back."
5,Awesome Experience,"Awesome hotel. Close to great restaurants and entertainment. Hotel food was fantastic. Service was excellent. All the staff went out of their way to help and make you feel welcome. Great view from the room, great water pressure and comfortable bed."
1,I will ever stay at an Omni again. The cleanliness was sub par. There was a love of gum on my nightstand the entire stsy,When I removed at the end of me at midnight I noticed there was a big piece of green gum attached to the nightstand I was so tired that I decided I would not call Lynn because they would fix it the next day when they clean the room or they would find it. That piece of gum remained for my entire stay. That means that’s the level of cleanliness in that room. That says everything about the quality of this hotel it is disgusting and I will never stay there again. I will let everybody I know my experience was there. Because it was such a busy trip I would arrive in my room late I was too tired to call somebody in to clean it I just kept hoping that the next day some cleaning person would actually notice it but that never happened this is just a disgusting hotel and I would not recommend it and would ask that you stay somewhere else because if you’re going to pay the rates that you pay at the Omni for this type of cleanliness it’s not worth it at all.
1,Overpriced and Terrible,"Stayed on a Monday night for a business meeting at the negotiated group rate of $239, down from $289. First, the stay isn’t worth either of those prices. Additional $32 or $44 for parking depending on self or valet. Additional “resort” fees for using the fitness center/pool. Additional internet fee. I mean what the hell does the $239 cover?!?! Once you get to the rooms, they are pretty plain Jane outside the longhorn hide ottoman and swanky leather chair that I’m sure 99% of the people don’t use simply for fear setting your feet on it will cost you $1,000+. TV is probably a 32” that takes 10 seconds swapping between channels. Small refrigerator with snacks and drinks that a regular sized Snickers or other candy will set you back $4, water $4, soda $5, beer $6-7, and a small Pringles for $5. Bathroom toilet paper is the John Wayne single-ply type. Shower had hair in it. Paper thin walls to hear a guy f#%*ing the brains out of a girl and the headboard hitting the wall plus their alarm going off for about 15 minutes since they were passed out from that session. They DO provide earplugs to drown out some of the traffic right outside your window. And lastly, you can change the thermostat, but the temperature doesn’t change like it’s controlled by the hotel. Again, I don’t know what you get for the money and I definitely don’t recommend this place to folks. Had it not been for our group being there, I would have found a cheaper place to stay and drove in knowing that some other place would have breakfast included and just as nice of rooms and amenities at no extra charge."
2,My Omni Austin Experience,"My experience was not that good, the room was too hot and the air would never really cool us off. We had to ask for a microwave in my opinion at the price we paid the room should come with a microwave and refrigerator."
2,Omni Jan 2019,"Location of the hotel was outstanding, walking distance to many fine restaurants, etc. Hotel service was definitely subpar for the price. I stayed on executive floors and my friends stayed on normal floors but I did not have access to their floors, if I had know that I would have just gotten a regular room. stayed 2 weeks and laundry service was down for 3 days over the weekend, asked management to help find an alternative and they told us to google it !! will never stay at an OMNI property again!!"
4,February Couples Trip,"Service was excellent. For my fiancé and I, the problem was with the room. The water from the faucet was either scorching hot or cold. It took some time to find the right placement for lukewarm water. The tv for our rom was rather small. We both don’t have the greatest eyesight for distance. The tv was rather small for the size of the room and a good distance away from the bed. The bed was not as comfortable as we expected it to be. It was really firm and the pillows were too. Lastly, the doors to the hotel rooms close loudly, so our neighbors leaving their room early in the morning often woke us up.. initially our heater for our room didn’t work either. We did call Maintanence for this and it was fixed right away. Thankfully so because Austin was about 35 degrees during our stay. Aside from these small details, our overall experience was excellent! Amazing location, service, very clean, and absolutely beautiful. Price point for the room was very fair as well. I would most likely stay here again."
5,Great Stay,This is the best hotel in all of Austin. Have stayed here on numerous occasions and they really bend over backwards tome you feel at home. Would not stay anywhere while in town and being this close to 6th street is a plus.
5,Never Dissapoints,"This is very clearly beautiful hotel with the perfect location. So close to all the excitement, yet a peaceful respite from all the action! The absolute, number one feature of this hotel is the wonderful staff. Not one dissapointment!"
1,Will not recommend,"We stayed there 4 nights, had a car and been charged almost $50 per night x 5! On the bill appeared like 4 charges, so I believe they did it intentionally! Had trouble with WiFi and the water smelled horrible.. Will never go back there Again!"
1,Not again,Not worth money you pay for room. Stay somewhere cheaper and use uber or other modes of travel. Water had like bad smell to it and service was rude. Never again for the price you are forced to pay and they dont honor military rates.
3,Great location not the best staff,"I stayed here for several nights while attending a conference. The location is great, the building is beautiful. My room had small windows on front side of the building and every morning I could hear noises from outside — the sound echoes because the building is tall and curved inward. Cleanness was good upon arrival but house keeping was not done properly during stay."
5,Very nice hotel,"Great location for checking out 6th Street, and also walking distance to the State Capitol and Longhorns Stadium.The staff was exceptional. I used multiple free nights (full disclosure - I'm a member of Omni's loyalty rewards program), so I had to make separate reservations for each night. The front desk handled it, without a problem. My room wasn't initially ready when I arrived, but the bellman checked my bag for me and the clerk told me she would call me once the room was ready. (I've heard that in a couple of other places before, but no one has actually ever called.) True to her word, I got a call about an hour later.The concierge desk was very helpful - they actually looked up a couple of attractions I wanted to see but with which they weren't familiar, and they made a couple of restaurant recommendations, as well.Absolutely no complaints about the room, and the atrium is really a sight to behold.If you have breakfast in the hotel, I'd recommend the migas - it was delicious!All-in-all a great stay!"
4,Nice Hotel,"We really liked this hotel. Very clean rooms, and the atrium was beautiful!! The walls are a little thin, we heard a couple next to us arguing for over an hour in the middle of the night. Otherwise, soft beds, clean rooms, and friendly staff."
5,6th Street Get Away,Went down with my lady to hang out on 6th St. The location was ideal. Very comfortable and clean. Service was great. The accomodations were just what we expected. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
5,Great trip,Everything was great as usual with Omni. We loved our room and every person we came in contact with offered superb service and was very friendly. Breakfast was great in Ancho's and they even had a gluten-free section to accommodate my special needs and give me a treat.
2,Disappointed,"No laundry service for my group, exorbitant amount of money for what we got, one person in my group stayed at a competitor and received daily cooked to order breakfast all for $50 less a night for a much better room and location"
4,Great Location,"Stayed here for 3 nights recently whilst attending a conference in the Austin Convention Centre. The hotel was certainly very convenient for that, being just a 10 minute walk away.My room was well appointed, large bathroom & 2 double beds (bit of overkill just for me, but appreciated the large size of the room.I found the wifi connection to be very patchy & often slow - not what you would expect these days. It would have been nice to have a kettle rather than a coffee-maker, but that may be just my englishness complaining !The food, however, was excellent, both in the restaurant & room service. I definitely recommend the Cobb Salad !Overall, splendid - loved the views from the rooftop pool & the trips to the enclosed lobby in the lifts were excellent."
5,Quick visit to Austin loved the downtown vibe and beuatiful hotel.,Loved how many y things were conviently located near the hotel. View of the capital was breathtaking and the quietness of the room was appreciated. Definitely interested in returning for a romantic weekend with the wife!
4,Great downtown Austin Hotel,"we chose the Omni Downtown Austin hotel because of price and location and we were not disappointed. The location is great. The staff in the lobby was always willing to help. Very friendly, courteous, and professional. The room we had could use some updating. the Bathroom was huge and really great, but the bedroom was small (I guess a downtown hotel often has small rooms, but it clearly was a bit worn...) The bed was comfy and considering we were downtown the hotel was very quiet which was a great feature. They have a 10pm quiet time policy, for us that was awesome. so other than the fact that the room could use some updating,we were very satisfied."
2,Horrible for a work trip,"Myself and 4 others are here for a 12 day business trip. We needed laundry done on Saturday and were told that they couldn't help us. Not the kind of service that I expect when paying a hotel around $3000 per person. The internet is slow, and you have to reconnect anytime that you get on the computer. Save your money and go anywhere else."
5,"Great location, staff is very welcoming",I was pleasantly surprised to return to Austin the downtown Albany location. The staff was very enthusiastic and welcoming. This was a complete change from previous trips to this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised at the warm reception and welcome received upon arrival. The rooms are of great quality and allowed for a very quiet and wonderful evening and a great location. This hotel is but one block from the infamous six street in Austin yet you could not hear the live music being played less than 100 yards away.
2,Not good for work,Horrible internet. Even the version that is $9.95 is extremely slow. That they even charge guests is sad.Room was not cleaned from previous guestNice restaurant with good breakfastBed was comfortable
5,Friendly and Efficient with great comfortable beds!,Staff was friendly and efficient and the suite was clean comfortable and spacious. Bell hop went over and above to accommodate my checkout and went back to get a forgotten item from the room after checkout. Location is perfect. Will be back.
5,Great Night's Sleep,"Spent several longs days at a Training Event. It was wonderful to come back to such a clean, cozy and comfortable place. Everyone at the Omni Austin Hotel was incredibly friendly and welcoming. Their customer service training must be awesome!"
5,Always a great experience but this time was even better.,Stay here regularly. Got upgraded to the 14th floor where I was provided breakfast and early evening apts. amazing! Food was great. Concierge was helpful. Cleaning service did a wonderful job and was exceptionally friendly.
4,Good meeting location,"Attended a meeting at this hotel and found it to be convenient, comfortable and a good hotel for a professional gathering. Staff was friendly and helpful. The only minor knock would be on their banquet food. “Adequate” is the best description; nothing special and pretty basic hotel fare. I’d certainly stay here again"
3,"Okay room, loud hotel",Average room and hotel but there is a lot of noise you hear staying at Omni. At 1am you’d hear people in the hallway yelling and slamming doors alongside drunk people down in the lobby area that you can hear 13 stories up.
4,"Great Location, Reasonable Price","Stayed here for a friends wedding which was held down the street. Enjoyed the hotel overall. Price was fair and the service was good. Room had a nice view overlooking Austin. It is frustrating in general to have to pay for a parking fee, but this is the way with all downtown Austin hotels. The garage was accessible, big, and clean. Would definitely consider staying here again when visiting Austin."
3,Tired hotel... time for refurb,"My spouse and I were here for New Year's Eve. It is in a good central downtown location but very near a lot of homeless camps so you will see many homeless in the streets and sleeping under bridges. It was sad. The staff at the hotel including the bartenders were all very nice and accommodating. Rooms service was also good. The lobby area is shared by clear glass offices and it was very cool looking but the actual rooms really need to be refurbished along with the hallways. They are dated however they are clean. They could stand to add some outlets and more modern technology as well. There were also some heating problems. I know it is not usually that cold in Austin but it was during our New Years Eve stay. The heat had to be up to 75 and it was still drafty from the large windows. Overall, it was a good stay but I would choose a more trendy hotel next time."
3,Nothing Special or Classy!,"We were not impressed with our stay over New Years:( The expensive Gatsy Ball they have is nothing but a drunken party, nothing classy about it! The club room was rather small and my husband had to bend down in the shower to even use it. Plus the mini fridge was hot, and we were told it was working fine, whatever! If you want to experience downtown Austin, there are much nicer hotels to choose from!"
3,Great location,"We stayed in a club level Suite. Service was excellent and the club offered a small breakfast offering that was very nice. The early evening cocktail hour was also very good with appetizers and drinks and the concierge serving was great. Rooms on club level are large with a bedroom, living room and large bathroom. Only downside is the rooms themselves, they are clean but look like they have not had updating in 20+ years. The carpets are worn out in the halls and rooms and it needs updating."
4,Extremely Satisfied,"Great location and beautiful hotel. I had trouble checking in because they didn't have the room I booked and TRIED to give me a smaller size for the same price. After seeing how unhappy I was someone else upgraded my room. That was the only bab experience, everything else was great."
4,Comfortable,"Location is excellent, we definitely had a restful evening and enjoyed site seeing . Other than not being able to use the exercise room and a dated TV .. we are satisfied and will definitely return to Omni hotels For business and pleasure"
1,Room was like a motel 6.,"They didn't change the sheets. The shower was super slippery and the glass door was coming out of its hinges because someone slipped in it before. The phone did not work and they charged us for a local call when someone tested it. They didn't provide more bathrobes, even when asked to."
1,Omni has lost its touch,"Horrible experience. Manager was rude and stated we had an upgrade when we didnt. Power was out throughout the first night of our stay. People and music sounds throughout the night. The room is dated. Tv is tiny and cable worked only 30% of the time. The valet is $42 a day and the self service parking is $38 a day. Your gold, platinum, or black level status means nothing anymore. No upgrades given, no wine upon arrival like before. They forgot to give us our free drink vouchers at check in. The Omni is not what it used to be.i would stay at the Omni 30+ nights a year. I will no longer stay here again."
5,The Omni never fails to impress,Omni hotels never fail to impress! Friendly and professional staff.... beautiful rooms and great sleep ;) we would never choose another chain. Valet was efficient- friendly staff- and very speedy car recovery..... offered direction assistance and thanked us for staying.
5,Good location,Perfect location for restaurants and bars. Hotel is nice and our room was great. The concierge 14th floor was closed due to low occupancy and there was an awful stain on the pull out mattress but over all good
5,Omni Austin Stay with a VIEW of State Capitol!,"To my surprise, I had great room with a view of the State Capitol! The view of the atrium was fascinating with visitors moving about. I slept soundly in a perfect room. Breakfast was delicious and all of the staff was wonderful!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Although I have stayed at the Omni in the past with great experiences I was very disappointed with this stay. I made reservations with a ""special"" rate through a corporate booking. I found at checking out that others in my group received a much better rate by simply using their AAA rate, which I could have used if I had known. Also, of 3 elevators, only 1 was working for two days. That caused significant delays and lines waiting for an elevator. On the other hand the service from the staff in all areas was outstanding."
5,Central location in Austin,"I was in Austin on business and the location proved to be within walking distance to all restaurants, shops and entertainment. I got upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was spacious and comfortable."
4,Beautiful hotel,"We visited for our anniversary. The staff was amazing, and the view from the hotel is great. We stayed on the 17th floor. Hotel is in a great location. I would recommend this hotel . We used the Valet for parking."
3,"Very Good, but not to the level of Omni",I would rate this hotel very high if the sound isolation would be adequate. The noise level is terrible inside and outside. Ice machine that was half corridor from me was making ice producing excessive noise. Party in the office building was running until 2AM.
5,Best Service Ever!,"Staff were all friendly and super helpful. Even had a microwave delivered to my room when I simply just wanted to bring it to a spot to heat up my leftovers. If I visit Austin, Texas, I will be definitely coming back here again!"
5,Great Customer Service,"Definitely a great customer service experience. When I arrive early at 9:15, even though check in was not until 3:00pm, I received a room. When I got to my room and the heater was making a strange noise, I called down to change rooms and was immediately brought a key to a new room. Forgot to pack my hairbrush, a comb was brought to me in the morning."
5,Long and a satisfying stay!,A very good choice for a business trip! I stayed at the hotel for 13 nights on a business trip and have no complaints! No hassles check in and check out and friendly staff. The concierge was also very helpful and gave me some good assistance in finding shopping sites nearby.The rooms are cosy and beds very comfortable with all the basic ameneties. The rooms need a makeover since it does not match the modern touch the hotel has on the outside. But this is not critical since there is no effect on the comfort. The housekeeping staff is also excellent and my room was always smelled nice and immaculate every evening.Location is excellent - Texas State Capitol and River Austin is not very far. The airport is a 20-30 minutes ride from the hotel (traffic can be a nightmare during peak hours in Austin so you are advised to keep a big buffer!) I would have appreciated if the hotel had a pick up/drop facility integrated in the package (and also breakfast!)The restaurant (Anchos) serves local fare and the bar stocks almost everything that one could wish for. Did not suffer much despite being a vegetarian since I was served good vegetarian stuff! There's also a Coffee bar inside. One can pick up a souvenier from a shop inside the hotel but do not expect a lot of variety.Overall a nice and comfortable stay!
4,Well located and well appointed,"A good choice if you want to pursue all the downtown activities Austin is famous for. Of course, that means premium rates for the hotel, but the convenience makes it worth every penny. This was close to the music clubs on sixth street and the myriad of culinary delights to be found in a cosmopolitan cowboy madhouse of creative energy.Rooms are more than nice, if a little cramped. Desk people were exceedingly polite and helpful. Coffee stand in the lobby is good. Keurig coffeemakers in rooms are a nice touch. Powdered creamer not nice."
5,Business Review,Hotel was excellent overall. Self Parking a Suburban was difficult. Could have better signage that ramp up actually leads to 7th Street and not another deck. I do understand the downtown location that limits parking infrastructure.
4,Very Nice Setting,The hotel is nice and the staff fairly friendly. We experienced a series of mishaps that rendered the hotel's friendliness as almost meaningless: 1) after preregistering on line it took much more time to get into our room than if I had waited until arrival for checkin. 2)the burst hot water pipe causing fire department evacuation at 4:30 am was inconvenient; I hadn't taken a 'sponge bath' in fifty years: still don't like sponge bathes!
2,Would not stay here again,"Room key issues. Closed breakfast early. Internet was less than 1mpbs best could get was about 500kpbs. Talked to tech support, manager, and front desk and they said is always slow and many people complain. Tech support says only 300mbps coming into the hotel for 301 rooms so will always be slow. Paid for upgrade still slow and that is when tech support said even if you pay for internet will be slow just not enough bandwidth coming into hotel. I come to Austin often and thought would try you all out but will not be back."
4,Lovely bed. Dramatic public spaces. Super pricey parking.,"The bed was incredible!!!! The public spaces were very dramatic and felt special. It would have been nice if there was information about the hotel in the room, like where the pool and gym were. It felt like they did not really want guests to use the amenities. The parking is super spendy, fortunately, you do not really need a car if you like to walk. The room was really clean overall, and I like how housekeeping attended to the room while we were there, but the tabletops had gummy spots on arrival. The desk staff were accommodating. Did I say the bed was incredible? I would rate value higher if parking was more reasonable and WiFi was included."
5,Pretty decent,Stayed in Omni for first time. It is good hotel with all the amenities. Parking was bit expensive otherwise it is a good hotel. I am a Marriott loyalist so likely will not be staying here again unless it is business trip
4,Great location.,Great location for exploring Austin on foot. The lobby was beautiful and the concierges were helpful with restaurant suggestions and tips for exploring the city. We used the fitness center daily and it provides lots of equipment and weights.
5,Great Hotel,"Wonderful staff in a beautiful hotel! Leon the valet is awesome! I would recommend to anyone and the location in Austin is great!! When I called the front desk to see about storing in a refrigerator, they sent one right up to the room."
3,Five Night Business Trip - Terrible WiFi,"Had a room on the 12th floor that was a good size but a little dated. Bed was very comfortable. Staff and service good. Had room service dinner two nights and at best the food was average.But my big problem with the Omni is that I paid $15 each day for fast wifi that super, super slow; the wifi was dreadful; I mentioned at reception and got a shrug of the shoulders. And for this reason next time I visit Austin I will be staying some place else."
5,Perfect location down,"This hotel has a great location downtown. You are in walking distance of the capital, restaurants, bars, etc. As always Omni does a wonderful job and it is an excellent hotel. I have stayed here multiple times."
3,Nice but not exceptional compared to other Omni properties,Shower tile was very slippery. When I mentioned this to guest services they alluded this is an issue they hear a lot of. They should post warnings or fix the problem.The rooms and common areas are becoming dated to newer Omni properties.Great location
5,Great stay,"Had a wonderful experience at the Omni. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The drinks and snacks provided daily were also great. The room was clean, tidy, and comfortable."
1,Very Disappointed,"I must preface this review with stating that I travel for business 2-3 times per month. Since many rooms were sold out, due to a conference, I stayed at the Omni hotel in Austin, TX on San Jacinto (downtown) for free, because my company paid for the business trip.Pros:everyone that I encountered was extremely helpful and nice.Cons:Very few power outlets in the hotel room.Insufficient lighting given the hotel room’s sizeCleanliness of the hotel bathroom, and a lack of linens being changed, although I requested it.Somewhat thin walls, I could others laughing in the room next to mine.My experience:My shower had someone else’s hair in it for two days in a row. On day one upon arrival, and on the second day of my stay.I was told that a housekeeping supervisor would follow up with me, and that never happened.For two days in a row, it also appeared that the toilet was never cleaned.On my last night at the hotel, I found some odd looking, caked on particles on my pillow and on a different pillow’s case. Also, because I specifically used a washable marker to mark the inside tag on my bed linens, I could tell that only some linens were changed, while others were not.Yes, the card indicating that I wanted linens changed was left on the bed.Seriously, due to poor housekeeping, I can’t recommend this hotel to anyone.I shouldn’t have to wonder if my room is actually clean or not, and question everything. Lastly, I’ll never stay at this Omni hotel location again."
3,Good location for downtown experience,"Hotel is within reasonable walking distance of restaurants, bars, shopping and parks with a safe feel of coming and going as long as you are aware of the homeless situation in a portion of the downtown area."
5,Omni is fantastic.,Every second was wonderful. Staff was great and quite attentive. Check in/check out was super fast and easy. Helpful front desk staff. They let us leave our luggage after we checked out so we could explore.
5,Fabulous hotel on the River Walk,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in San Antonio. This hotel is located right on the River Walk and is one of our favorites. The rooms are beautiful and the staff is superior. Alfredo at the front desk made our stay one of our best ever! His service and extra special touches made him our favorite. Thank Alfredo for making our stay amazing!
4,Very decent stay,"My fiancé and I stayed here for 4 nights for a first trip to Austin. We attended the ACL music festival and so hotels were expensive this time of year and the Omni was more reasonable but still not cheap. Everything was quite good enough for us but was expecting it to be nicer for what we paid. The service and staff are always super great at Omnis and that held true here, but the place could definitely use some renovations. With that being said, still enjoyed our stay but updates would be nice. Next time I’d like to stay in a different area of Austin, anyway so I would not return for that reason but if had to stay downtown close to 6th street, good option."
4,Good Location/ Nice Balcony,"We went to Austin for Halloween. The hotel is centrally located and as we had a suite, we had a balcony, which was great. The price is very good for the location. Our only complaint is that the sofa bed was uncomfortable."
3,4 Stars for the Hotel/2 Stars for the Lounge,"The positives: Location was great for our activities. Lots of restaurants, etc. within walking distance. The room was a decent size, lots of hot water in the shower and the beds were comfortable (although the mattresses were sliding off so I think they may need to be replaced). Most of the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. Special kudos to Stacy who worked in the 14th floor lounge several days during our stay -- she was attentive, pleasant, and helpful. Really liked that the lounge offered a selection of newspapers each day, including Sunday.The not-so-positives: Definitely disappointed with the food options at the 14th floor lounge. While they advertise it as a continental breakfast, there's also oatmeal, sausage/bacon, and an egg dish each day. The egg dishes were all sadly tasteless and perhaps they'd be better off focusing on more robust fruit platters, etc. It seemed that when all the food was eaten (ie fruit during the morning or cheese in the afternoon), then that was hit (so get there early)! They were dealing with the water crisis so while there was coffee on 2 of the mornings, none was available on the 3rd morning, and there never was any hot water for tea. It might have been nice if they provided bottled iced tea....Perhaps I'm spoiled by staying at several Marriotts over the last couple months and being on their executive floor (lounges were uniformly wonderful). I'd consider staying at the hotel again, but not paying extra for the lounge floor."
5,Good location and service. Relax by rooftop pool,"Easy walk to sites, restaurants and music from the Omni. Beautiful lobby with restaurant and bar, nice breakfast bar option at reasonable cost. Very helpful staff. Beds are super comfortable. The rooftop pool is a gem.The concierge floor is an option I would recommend for its happy hour and breakfast, reasonably priced for what you receive."
5,UT System EAC,"Excellent customer service, employees collaborated together, in order to provide excellent customer service for a diverse population, creativity to collaborate and understand the various cultures in and out of the hotel, there is an understanding and knowledge of the visitors to make effective change to create a comfortable culture."
5,Amazing Service,"Upon check in and during other encounters I was treated like a rock star. It is so refreshing as a business traveler to receive that next level service. Dana R at the front desk went above and beyond to print items out for me, coordinate some business needs I had and did all of this with an amazing attitude! I will stay here again largely because of the service."
5,Met our expectations,A cool and clean hotel for exploring downtown Austin. Nice rooftop pool and concierge lounge with free happy hour (top of the line) and breakfast. Location worked well. Staff very nice. Reserve on their website and beware of gestation.com. Price was good though we had to stay over on a Sunday.
5,Great hotel,Great hotel right in the middle of down town Austin. Conveniently located just a few blocks from 6th street. Nice amenities for business having a medium to large size conference. Food and service was great.
5,Trip to Austin for F1 Race,"The Omni hotel was excellent for our needs. The hotel service was great, location was ideal and the food was very good. I'd highly recommend. We had a rental car, and the delivery of our car when we needed it was fast."
3,Eh,"Hotel okay, very nondescript modern building. Main problem was its location- 6th Street very unappealing area- wish we had stayed in the SoCo area (or if we could afford it, at the Fairmont, which was gorgeous"
2,Nice hotel - bad customer service,"Showed up and they told me they had no reservation for me. Called the 3rd party I booked through who provided a confirmation code for the booking, they still said they had nothing. Front desk spoke to the 3rd party and then asked for my credit card, when I asked what this was for the Front Desk worker condescendingly said to me that it was for incidentals and couldn't believe I was asking. Come to find out after departure I was in fact charged double for the stay. Overall the hotel was nice the rooms were great, the majority of the staff was very friendly and helpful - it was essentially one person that ruined the experience and put me through the headache of having to try and get $1200 in charges back on my credit card."
2,Can hear everything in the surrounding rooms,All would have been fine except for the price we paid for the room I feel like we should not have had to hear people and their extracurricular activities in the room next to us - upgrade your soundproofing!
4,STAFF was great!,"Overall a great experience. Just a couple small suggestions for improvement. If you book, I definitely suggest a KING size bed. The doubles are truly full size beds (vs queen in many hotels) and very small for a couple. Will return in the future."
2,Not a nice hotel,"Very disappointed in this property. Approaching our room, the carpeting was worn and the ice machine was loud. In the room, there are few outlets and the one next to the sink worked sporadically. The iron leaked water. To make coffee, you need to remove the machine from a cabinet and the find a place to set it down near a rare outlet. The a/c unit screeched. No free coffee in lobby. Room and parking were expensive. I would recommend saving your money and finding another place to stay."
3,Business meeting at the convention center,"The room was very nice and roomy. It was a 'handicap' room & an executive suite, so I'm not sure what the other rooms were like. The bathroom was understandably large with walk-in shower and there was a small alcove with the treadmill. It was more like a small apartment that a hotel room (full kitchen) and would be a great place to stay if you are in Austin for an extended period of time. My issues are with the food service."
5,Great hotel,"We recently stayed at the Omni downtown. Extremely good location, comfortable beds, great service and sign up for their priority service and free coffee will be delivered to your door each morning! I think that is the reason we were given free coffee. Walking distance to all sights. Don’t miss the LBJ library, definitely a highlight. Highly recommend."
5,Great place to stay for ACL,Loved this hotel! It was such a great distance from Zilker Park (we came for ACL) and RIGHT off 6th street. Went to Voodoo every morning! The hotel was ready way before 3 pm which was a blessing as we were exhausted from flying into Austin. Also got a KILLER deal from Expedia too!
5,Omni Downtown Austin,"Omni provided great service in every area. I was there for a business workshop, while not eating in a hotel restaurant they did provide lunch and breakfast for the workshop and it was outstanding. The overall experience was just top drawer."
4,"Lovely room, great location","We had an executive suite and it was a very nice room. The only thing I would change is there was no kitchen type amenities (main room sink, refrigerator, microwave) for people who are staying in the suite because they're staying for a long period of time. Shower had excellent pressure, beds were incredibly comfortable and the location can't be beat. Hotel restaurant is better than average, and they have a waiter called Pedro who is fantastic. If you go, ask for him!"
5,Great Hotel in Great Location,"Would definitely stay here again. Although somewhat expensive (we were there for Austin City Limits Music Festival), I would return. We arrived just before noon hoping to just drop our bags and we were given our room key. Many restaurants and bars are within walking distance- including the 6th street entertainment district. Staff friendly and knowledgeable."
4,Friendly service,"I agree that the rooms need to be updated. But what they lack in updates, they make up for in service. The rooms aren’t disgusting by any means, and the beds and linens were clean and changed daily. Requested a city view club room. Accommodated is almost immediately. Even spent a lot of time filling us in on the best spots to visit while in town. Restaurant downstairs was delicious, but the club lounge food was awful. The food was always cold no matter how early you got there. I don’t think they are using the stern is correctly. The food wasn’t placed in water. The sausages they served for breakfast weren’t even breakfast sausages. They were Italian sausages for dinner. Only went to refresh on drinks. I would definitely stay again, but wouldn’t bother with the club room next time unless they really change things."
4,Time for renovation!,This is a very generous 4!! Very beautiful hotel and lobby but needs extreme remodeling in the rooms! Some of the rooms had a moldy smell. The suites were renovated and much nicer. Friendly and polite staff but not very accommodating.
2,"Lots of reputation, not much delivery","It took fifteen minutes of discussion to ""find"" a room after reservation was lost. Room on executive floor was recently renovated but was small by today's standards. It overlooked 6th St. and street and club noise was pervasive."
4,hotel survey,"Brilliant hotel, lots of positives to numerous to list. Only down side was the number of homeless/vagrant begging people in the area around the hotel but the whole of this area of Austin seemed to suffer from the same problem. The hotel could not be blamed for this and we would highly recommend this hotel."
5,Central Location,"This is a beautiful hotel in downtown Austin, close to all historical sites, restaurants and bars. Staff were nice and executive lift to club rooms is a nice touch. The reception sit down area outside the bar and restaurant is quite small for such a large hotel.The rooftop pool is fantastic - there is no staff there, but towels are left out already.My room was a large executive room and had large kitchen area and sitting room. Bed was really comfortable and bathroom was huge."
3,Well kept but dated,Room decor is a bit dated for someone my age. The TV was so small and old it only supported 720p. Receiving a package from Amazon was a bit of a chore for the staff. It didn't seem they had much of an efficient process for this.
5,"Great hotel, great location",Very cool hotel in a great location. Enjoyed our time here. The roof top pool was an added bonus although we were disappointed to find out the bar on the roof top deck closed on Labor Day weekend. Don't order drinks from the room service phone up on the roof...you will get tagged big time.
3,It all depends on which room you get,Fairly older style hotel in the downtown area. I was assigned initially to a room which looks into the internal courtyard - the hotel is connected to an office tower. The light in the room was very poor and the noise level was high because it faces inwards and is above the hotel and office foyer. The hotel receptionist was kind to move me to an external facing room which was considerably more comfortable. The room size is pretty spacious but the hotel is quite dated and could benefit from a refurb.
5,Well worth the money,"The room and view was incredible. The room was morw like a condo then a hotel. Having ur own tread mill and work out area, seperate living room and bedroom was great. If i had to nit pick about anything id say the tv sizes were a bit small for the wonderful size living and bedroom."
3,Convenient in the heart of Austin's downtown,"The Omni is within walking distance of the beautiful State Capital Building. The building is a large glass atrium. There is a large lobby with bars and restaurants. The second floor, which looks down on the lobby has meeting rooms. Both in the meeting rooms and my room (a suite) I found a shortage of electrical outlets. They are there but in short supply. Also, oddly, my room had only small trash receptacle.My room was spacious and comfortable. The wifi worked well. The staff was professional and helpful. My next comment is about the city. There are homeless people most every where you walk. Some are quite aggressive."
3,Paid for a 4-star experience that I didn't get,"The staff was extremely welcoming, but the accommodations were disappointing. The rooms were outdated (small tv's, old carpeting, old tile), and there wasn't even free wifi. The rooftop pool and location were the best parts of the hotel. I most likely won't stay in an Omni Hotel again—wasn't worth the money!"
5,Great experience,"One thing that I can say of the Omni hotels are the consistency of their services. It is a great location. People are very friendly and professional. I had been in other business, and I can say this one have a great value/"
4,Great place downtown!,"Great place to stay central. Walking distance to eateries, venues and bars. Some rooms face business offices, make sure those curtains are closed, if you happen to get one of them. Just to inform you, the hotel is on one side of the building and business are on the other. Overall it's a good stay."
4,Clean & Comfortable,"My wife and I stayed here for an extended weekend. The location was very convenient to most of downtown and within walking distance of most restaurants, bars, attractions, etc. The rooms were very clean and all the elevators were all prompt and had great lobby views. There were separate elevators to the underground parking. Daily parking rates were vastly over-priced. The pool on top afforded nice views, but the bar drinks prices exceeded the norm and guests were not allowed to bring their own. Beds were comfortable and noise was rarely a factor."
4,Sweet Dreams,"Great location, and very open when you walk in. Was greeted quickly by the front desk and checked in fairly quickly. This was my first time to Austin so I was pretty excited and from the outside looked like it was a very nice hotel.I was a little disappointed with the room based on my expectations. The room felt very old, and had a little smell to it. The window in my room overlooked the interior of the hotel with a view of the offices that were connected. Would have preferred an outside view, but honestly I was fine with that. Different, and as much as i stay in hotels, different is good.The overal facility was great and I for the price we got on the room I have to recommend. However, the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 star is really due to the lack of updates that room needs.I must also say the the hotels credit, I did sleep like a baby 2 nights in a row, and that is important!"
5,Always a great place to stay,The hotel is always clean with super friendly front desk personnel. We love the easy access to park and have in and out access. The hotel is conveniently located to 6th street as well as other downtown areas. Always felt safe when walking to and from hotel. The hotel is quiet so no worries about not being able to sleep in while on vacation. The rooftop pool is just the right size and always eventful.
1,Terrible experience,Hotel manager Alexis Calvo was very condescending and provocative. Made our experience absolutely devastating with her overall attitude. Her attitude is inexcusable and we will not be staying at an Omni hotel because of the way we were treated.
1,Over priced and not worth it,Worst experience I have had in a long time! Over charged me twice for one night! Food wasn’t cooked paid 600 for club level and it’s maybe worth $250.00. out dated and no customer service and can’t park a truck in the self parking so parked in vallet and the vallet moved it and hit my hitch on the wall and they didn’t say anything about it!
3,Misunderstanding,"I had wanted to get a suite , I called and made sure that , that’s what I was purchasing, the other person on the line said I was , when we arrived it was not the room I wanted , I had to go buy another room elsewhere at the comfort suites , really ruined my vacation!!"
5,AT&T Area Manager External and Legislative Affairs,It surpassed my expectations. The front desk greeted me with a smile and made me feel right at home. The room was beautiful and spacious. I had plenty of clean towels in the room and in the gym. I really enjoyed the gym experience.
4,Good location and full-featured hotel,"Stayed two nights at the Omni for a business meeting done off site. Only food and beverage I used was from the lobby-level coffee stand (Peet's). Staff was very pleasant and helpful and the hotel is attractive and comfortable. Huge atrium makes the hotel very modern and spacious. my room was a king at the end of the hall -- large and very comfortable -- especially the bed. Lots of top hotels downtown, but the Omni would certainly be a place to which I'd return."
3,kicked out of pool,"I was not expecting for my husband and I to get kicked out of the pool as we enjoyed our last night on the rooftop for a crowd of military personnel that was dressed for the ballroom and not the pool. Security asked that we enjoy our ""last 5 minutes"" as we would have to leave soon so that the private party could enjoy the pool all for themselves. We had planned this pool into our schedule and cut out dinner with local friends to enjoy this time and ended up getting kicked out to literally dry in the cold! VERY OFFENSIVE"
5,Really great stay,I loved the location. It was a little pricey but totally worth it! We were in walking distance of so many places. The room was as also very comfy and we loved that one of the walls was actually windows that overlook the lobby of the hotel. It was a really cool view. There is a restaurant there if you want to take advantage of that too. You have to pay to park and it was like $30 a night.
4,Great Staff and location,Well located in the downtown area close to everything! This hotel has friendly helpful staff. Who made my stay memorable from Dan at the front door - you are warmly greeted and well cared for.I liked the connivence the club floor for breakfast and afternoon drinks and snacks. Clean well appointed rooms - will not disappoint.Easy walk to 6th street and Convention Centre.
5,Best p;lace to sleep!,"Since I am a Select Guest of Black level, I know that I recieve many ""perks"" that regular do not. Nonetheless this is a great place to stay and reasonable by Austin standards. I was an Omni customer long before I was black level, that is how I rose to the status of ""Black""!"
4,Great Location,Perfect place for someone looking to stay close to 6th St. Was a very short walk for all our weekend entertainment. Hotel is very clean and the entire staff is very friendly. The room was very clean and up to date.
3,Disappointed!,"So many issues happened throughout our stay! Parking was terrible, room card didn’t work half the time upon entering and exiting. I was given some sort of barcode paper for my windshield which also failed. Fire alarm that was apparently “scheduled” and a note left in our room letting us know, but we had no memo! My wife had to walk down emergency stairs from 16 level with our 2 month baby girl half naked because it was performed in the AM!...so much more issues this is just a general review. Good lucky!"
5,Great hotel with friendly staff,"The hotel was really nice with a rooftop pool. The location was great and many sights were in walking distance, like the capitol.The room was clean and a lot of towels were provided.Whenever we had a question the staff was really helpful."
5,Great location 100% comfortable,Hotel located downtownWalking distance from the capito and a great variety of restaurants and barsHotel has room service all dayInternet connection complementary when registering and good speed and connectivityRestaurant has a “to go” concept and small cofee shop which I found extremely useful
5,"My bed, My cloud",Nothing (other than my own bed) compares to the bed and bedding of the Omni! Was there mid-august for a convention and the little hours of sleep I had were delectable. A definite recommendation for business stay!
4,My review of the Omni Austin,The Omni is a nice hotel that is centrally located and near the highway. It was easy to get in and out of the city and venture out to other parts of the city and is within walking distance to the entertainment district.
5,Fabulous,"Massive building with overwhelming design! Glass elevators and marble lobby. The rooftop bar offers exquisite views of the city. Valet, WiFi, a bar and restaurant downstairs. Also a gift or souvenir store. This is a fantastic venue for corporate meetings - in fact, it shares the building with Capital Factory which offers office spaces to young entrepreneurs."
5,Great downtown location,"I stayed here 2 nights with my 6 year old daughter in a 1 bedroom Executive Suite. Room was well decorated, clean and the view from the 18th floor alone kept my daughter amused several minutes at a time! Sofa bed was even relatively comfortable.Rooftop pool is small but was warm and though mostly full of hipsters, they were gracious enough to my daughter.Breakfast buffet staff was incredibly kind- bringing cookies out to my daughter to take as a treat for later. Food was good and plenty of choice.Great location for downtown. Friendly staff. Despite being mostly a business hotel, everyone was incredibly kind to my daughter and most stopped to have a little chat with her.Would happily recommend and return."
5,Quick visit to Austin,My recent trip to Austin was shorter that I would have liked. It's a fun town. The experience was made that much better by the accommodations and staff at the Omni. They were very attentive and friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again on future trips. Thanks!
3,Stay for Earth Wind an Fire concert,I wish more things like the coffee shop was open didn't really get a chance to enjoy the hotel coffee shop and gift shop was closed on Sunday. Love the fact that it was right in the heart of Austin so I went for a walk and it was a lot to do in the area. Walking distance to the concert was also a plus. I don't remember a happy staff not a lot of welcoming smiling people just all look like this my job and I am here. I also remember doors being locked on the side of hotel and as hot as Texas is go around was a pain and you did not know until you got all the way up the stairs.
4,Good location,"We recently stayed at the Omni hotel for our annual girls weekend. I had stayed earlier in July at the JW Marriott but since the convention was on town, the prices were quite high. We stayed on the concierge floor which I would highly recommend. A good selection for breakfast and the happy hour had 2 different hot appetizers each night along with top shelf alcoholic choices. This hotel was much quieter than the JW. The pool was not a drunk fest and the room were spacious and updated. My only complaint was the front desk. We checked in and we're not given keys that worked in the elevator for the concierge floor. In addition, upon check out, I was charged for internet which should have been waived and was after pointing it out and my friend left her charger in the room which required three trips to the front desk to get a key for her to get back in. This was while I was holding our Uber driver at the entrance. Shout out to the doorman who helped her and was so happy and upbeat each time we entered the hotel. The gym was decent and I would stay at this hotel again."
5,perfect location,"Omni Austin Downtown location is right in the heart of the city and there’s so much to do within walking distance. The hotel was super clean and the staff was professional and helpful even with a sold out hotel. It’s a perfect place to stay if you want quality, affordability and location."
5,Beautiful Hotel,"We have enjoyed every stay at this location in Austin,Texas. The location is perfect for convention center and the fun of Sixth Street to Shopping. Rooms are always nice and the lobby is a great meeting spot."
3,Really disappointed,"I recently reviewed another Omni property, which, along with the austin property, was one of my favorites. Again, I am disappointed. I noticed on my confirmation that my Omni Rewards number was missing. I called the hotel, and they “added” my number. It was not on the reservation when I checked in. It was “added” again. Two weeks after checking out I had to spend 15 minutes on the phone with Omni guest services to get credit for my stay. As for the facility, staff was lackluster. More intent on looking at their iPhones than serving guests. My room was never serviced the first day I was there. Hotel told me it was because I checked in so late due to delayed flights, housekeeping did not know the room was occupied. Room is showing its age. NO thank you upon checkout. Total service fail from my perspective. Time to find another favorite hotel in Austin."
5,Great for exploring Austin.,Very nice hotel. Quiet and comfy rooms. if you have small kiddos and they are dead set on doing pool time there may be some disappointment. When we stayed and went to use the pool there were just too many folks in the pool.
5,Great Place to Stay,Room was very clean when I checked in there were 4 people in front of me manager came out and gave everyone a bottle of water who was waiting. Person at counter asked if i needed help with my bags which iI declined. Room was cleaned perfect everyday. Food there is very good in hotel had buffet one day and eggs Benedict the next day. Will go back next time in Austin
3,Club Level Not Worth Price,"The Omni Hotels in Dallas and Fort Worth are incredible. This hotel was very underwhelming. The pool is tiny, the room was nothing special, and the Club food was not the best. Free drinks is nice, but I do not think it is worth the extra price. You can hear every door on the floor open and close."
5,Exceptional customer service!,"My wife, son, and I were thoroughly pleased with our stay at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. Every staff member that we interacted with were pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful. We have stayed at numerous Omni locations and this ranks right at the top of the list. The amenities, location, and room can't be beat! We will definitely stay here next time we are in Austin."
3,Meh,"An overpriced average hotel. There is truly nothing special about this hotel at all. The bed wasn’t comfortable, temp in the room hard to keep constant and the elevators didn’t work most of the time. Just blah."
4,Lovely Hotel With Thin Walls,"We always stay at this hotel when in Austin. The Omni Hotel Downtown is right off of 6th Street, a one block walk from the bar and restaurant scene. This is a plus and a minus. You are walking distance from where everything is happening (or crawling distance, depending on how much fun you had). It’s also very loud on the weekends. The noise from the main drive a block away comes right through the walls. The screaming baby next door didn’t help my sleep either. There is a rooftop pool and bar that is wonderful, although there’s not a whole lot of seating. All in all, a great hotel. Just get an inward facing room. This stay was a bit worse than normal, but usually our stay is very pleasant and I would recommend it."
5,In Austin for a conference,"I spent 2 nights at the Omni Hotel in Downtown Austin and 2 days attending a conference in the Hotel. Everyone was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms were comfortable, clean, and spacious. The catered food was OK, nothing exceptional but fine. The Hotel is close to 6th Street which made it easy to walk a few block and find all sorts of restaurants. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting Austin who wants to be in the downtown area."
5,We were very pleased,"This hotel is very clean and beautiful. Very nice rooms. Small, but nice pool with a view. The staff was very helpful and informative. Great access to downtown. The only thing missing was a comp breakfast."
5,Very Nice with Great Food and Staff,It was the quickest check in and check out I have ever had. The food was wonderful. The staff were super friendly. The rooftop pool was wonderful. We really enjoyed our stay. It is a very location for all of the great food around down town
5,Impressed with First Time at Omni Hotel,"I stayed at the Omni Hotel in Austin this past weekend for a Conference. It was my first time in Austin and staying at an Omni hotel. I was impressed with the hotel and the staff, who was friendly and knowledgeable about things to do in the Austin area. Would definitely recommend staying at the Omni."
3,Expensive for less than average. Terrible parking.,"The good. 1. Nice room and balcony. The bad. 1. The online check-in did not save any time on checking in. The counter person still had to take a lot of information before giving the room key. 2. The wait line at the counter for the online check-in was so long that it probably would have been quicker to do the conventional check-in. 3. Signs saying to not make noise in your room and visitors were not allowed. What the heck is that about? 4. We were not allowed to take our own drinks to the outdoor pool. 5. Cost of room was a little expensive. 6. Parking sucks around the hotel. Had to park in the Omni garage and was charged an outrageous price of $42, EACH NIGHT!!!!!!! 7. Hotel is dated. The varnished plywood end tables that are used in the rooms and elevator areas are some of the cheapest looking furniture I have ever seen in a hotel that I had to pay $375 a night for a room. Sorry but I would not recommend this hotel."
4,"Excellent staff, good food, small pool","We just stayed one night, were in town for a couple of concerts. Perfect location for our stay. The staff was excellent, from bell staff to front desk to lobby bar. We requested an exterior facing view and they were able to accommodate that. We were in a one bedroom suite (love the cowhide bathroom walls in 1710). No issue with noise, bed and pillows were comfortable. We had appetizers at the lobby bar and the food was quite good (crab cakes and carnitas tacos). The pool was small for the number of people there, but the pool bartender was excellent, made an awesome margarita on the rocks, and the rooftop location was really nice. Parking seemed expensive on top of everything else, but it's probably about on par with other downtown hotels. Overall, a great experience and would stay there again."
4,Great location!!,"Super easy and convenient to 6th in the heart of downtown. Hotel rooms were ok, pictures look nicer online, but still fine to just rest your head. Suite our friend had on the 17th floor was really nice and upgraded."
2,Needs Updating,"First, the hotel is in a great location. Was very close in walking distance to 6th street and capital building. Other than that the hotel is in need of some major updating. We stayed on the 7th floor and the carpet in the hallways along with in our room was dirty and coming apart at the seems. Further the free wifi is horrible. If you are lucking enough to connect you aren't able to even use a internet browser as it seems the signal isn't strong enough.I really like Omni hotels but unfortunately this hotel represents the Omni brand in a negative way."
1,horrible experience,"Checked in late around midnight, i called to tell the front desk so that they knew of a late checkin. Prepaid before we got to the hotel. When i arrived they took my credit card and charged a security fee of $50 dollars.When we got to room i decided to check my bank account and they charged me $207.00 plus the $50.My moms credit card was also charged $220.00 as well. At this point it was 1;30am and when i called the front desk to make tell them about the charge they said there was nothing they could do and that it would take 5 days to return it back to my debit account.My mom called they next day and left a message for the manager to call her and he never did. This was on July 23,2018.Poor management on there part. Wont be staying at this or any Omni hotel."
5,"Older feel, but great for a good night's sleep","This looks like an older property, but it worked great for me. It is a short walk to the convention center which means most of the convention attendees are probably at the hotels closer to the convention. I prefer some respite away from the majority of the attendees. I also love when you can black out the entire bedroom via the curtains and the doors. My bedroom had a little hallway before the guest room door away from the main hall/thoroughfare and shielded you from most of the noise of people coming in and out of their guest rooms. I slept very well. My room and bathroom were very clean. It had a very traditional decor, dark woods, large furniture, etc. The pool deck and pool seemed small, it seems more suited for standing and socializing than swimming laps or play. There were nice lounge chairs that looked well-kept. There is a poolside bar but I believe it is only open and staffed during certain times of the year. It was not open when I was there, but I saw people order something through the house phone. I witnessed the staff dealing with an issue on the pool deck two lounge chairs away and remarked to my colleague how professional and polished they were being even thought the guest was being belligerent."
5,Business Trip,Great hotel. I always enjoy staying her when in town on business. Friendly staff and great food! The update to the Concierge Lounge floor is WORTH the money! Breakfast is great and the evening cocktails and appetizers are wonderful!
3,Needs updating,"Hotel lobby is nice but guest room was terrible. First thing when we walked in was a big iron burn in the carpet. TV reception was bad, bathroom doorhandle kept falling off. Room overall looked very run down. Commotion all night including guest across the hall being kicked out."
4,Great hotel,Came to town for a concert and i got this hotel online. It was in a good location and hotel itself is very nice. Check in was a breeze. My room was standard hotel room but wasn’t bad at all. I found the bed comfortable. I liked the rooftop pool deck as well but pool pretty small. The music at the pool was great. Mix of 80s 90s! I also didn’t like how they had no vending machines on the floors for water or soda or a snack. It was all in the mini bar. I’m not paying $5 for a can of Coke lol i would def stay here again!
3,Would be a 4 star review if sleeping quality is better,"Stayed in Omni hotel during a business trip. The hotel was located conveniently. Short walk to all kinds of restaurants, cafe, bar, shopping, also close to tourist attractions like state capital.The room was spacious. Complimentary bottled water was provided. Bed was comfortable. The wifi is about $9 per day but if you join the hotel loyalty program, you got the free standard wifi plus complimentary drinks (coffee/tea/juice) in the morning. No usb charger was a let down. Bathroom was clean and big. Water pressure was good though the shower area was a bit dark.Compliment to the curly hair girl at the front desk (sorry forgot her name). She's very friendly and welcoming, patiently answered my questions with a warm smile.Sadly, my sleeping quality was poor during my stay. The hotel was close to the busy 6th street, in which live music was played every night till late. The noise insulation for the hotel wasn't good. For a light sleeper like me, it's really hard to get a good rest. The hotel realised the problem and provided ear plug in each room -- didn't really help though. If the sleeping quality wasn't that bad, I'll give the hotel a 4 star."
5,Great Conference Center,"Here now attending a conference. This is my first stay at this Hotel. It’s very clean and the staff are amazing. Beds and pillows are comfortable and the amenities are great! Very close (walking distance)to several great restaurants, but also has a great restaurant inside the hotel. Garage parking is easy and convenient. You won’t be disappointed!"
4,Omni Austin downtown,"Very nice property. I will stay at the Omni downtown for every visit to Austin. My family and I enjoyed all 3 nights.The picture of the upper level pool was misleading, it is very small. They were disappointed"
3,Hotel does not have a wheelchair accessible pool - don’t be fooled by their website,"The Omni Austin Downtown is lovely on the surface, but don’t stay here if you are in a wheelchair. I was debating whether I stay at this hotel or the Westin and regret my decision. First up, and in fairness this is not the hotel’s fault, but it is on a hill. If you are travelling solo like I was, it’s a hill to get down or up no matter what direction you are going. My next gripe is the lack of wheelchair access to the pool. The hotel staff will talk you it is ADA compliant as they have a hoist to get disabled ppl in and out of the pool... however, you have to get up 15 steps in order to access it! Yes, that’s right - the ada compliant pool is only compliant if there is a miracle and you can suddenly walk. The hotel staff are very quick to defend the fact there is no mention of this on the website and insist the pool is ADA compliant — clearly they are missing the 15 steps / wheelchair issue! The hotel’s solution is to drive you to another one of their hotels to use the pool, which is completely unacceptable. Should have booked Westin, which has an amazing pool and is not on a hill. Furthermore, one of the employees did offer to refund part of my money considering I missed out on the pool... only it was never refunded and after I enquired (and had to follow up on my email four days later as they hadn’t bothered to respond), the person insisted once again that the pool was ADA compliant and they won’t be refunding the proposed amount as I booked through a third party. It was clearly all too hard and they have no idea how insulting it is to say something is compliant once you get up the 15 steps - it was like they thought I was making a big deal out of the steps. If you have any special needs, don’t stay at this hotel - they also very rarely look to see if you need help opening the doors to get in and out of the hotel (staff only interested in talking amongst themselves) nor did they bother to help with bags. That aside, if you are not in a wheelchair it’s a fairly nice hotel and thankfully you will be able to use the pool!"
2,$42 for valet parking Room 1820 is a joke,"Our 18th floor ""suite"" was incredibly noisy. They advertise 700 square feet, but alot of that space is 2 long hallways and tons of wasted space. There is no refrigerator outside of the mini bar. The bed is so close to the drapes that you bump into and open the drapes every time you get up and open the blinds onto the person in be still trying to sleep. Make sure you are dressed when you walk around your suite as the guys in the offices in the same complex can see into your room. There is only one sink and toilet, so if you have guest sleeping on the pull out couch, they need to come into the main bedroom to use the bathroom. Same goes for if you are working or entertaining in the room. $42 for valet is a joke. I guess you could self park and save $10, but $32 is too high too. Austin isn't Austin anymore."
5,"Amazing stay with the family, just needs a little ac maintenance done","The hvac system should have a maintenance done on it. The air flow was not good, usually this indicates that the air filter should be changed or cleaned depending on what type is in the unit, or the evaporator coil needs a good cleaning. Other than that we haya wonderful time."
5,Austin Business trip,Great hotel. Nice clean & bright rooms. Really interesting lobby area. Hotel had a great feel about it - relaxed & chilled vibe. Good location. Well equipped gym (and very clean) Would certainly return.
5,The Best Hotel Experience We've Ever Had.,"We are travelers. We have never had such an amazing experience anywhere, including Europe and Mexico. The staff at the Omni Austin downtown was spectacular, with amazing hospitality for our family and little boy. We are so thankful and will always stay here. And, we will recommend our all of our friends to stay here as well. Great location, great views of Austin, safe, luxury quality."
5,Awesome Austin Getaway!,"Omni was the perfect place to stay in Austin. Great view, quality amenities and customer service. Walking distance to many restaurants and easy access to sixth street and Rainy street bars for local bands!"
3,Should've Been Better,"Not worth what I paid. Didn't feel very welcome. Difficulty checking in. Parking Outrageous. Room was clean, bathroom was unimpressive. Pillows were great, water was hot with decent pressure, bed was super comfy."
1,Dissatisfied,"Did not meet the standards for an Omni hotel. Staff was apathetic at best, did not greet us when we arrived or directed us to our rooms. Cleaning was not performed in a timely manner. There were smokers in the room adjacentto us and the staff didn't notice."
5,Fantastic Wedding Reception Spot!!,"We could not have been more impressed with this Omni as a reception spot, as a hotel, as the venue for the most beautiful day of our lives! And to top it off, it is across the street from our church, so moving guests from the ceremony to the reception was a snap (no driving or parking troubles and half the guests getting lost). Book early, they fill up!"
5,Great visit,Staff was welcoming And extremely nice. Excellent room service. My family and I definitely enjoyed staying at the hotel and will be sure to return soon. Rooms were also clean and pool on the rooftop was amazing.
4,Great staff,"Bit of a strange place - hotel on one side of the atrium and offices the other. Room was large enough, clean and bathroom too. Friendly bar. OK breakfast - go for the buffet unless you want to pay $$$$. Evening food not so good. Very poor calamari. Average quesadilla. Good fishcakes. Wine expensive. Valet parking expensive. BUT, all of the the staff were fantastic. They made the stay."
5,Awesome time in Austin!,My husband and I absolutely loved our time at the Downtown Austin Omni! Perfect location for fun and exploration! Super courteous staff and wonderfully clean and comfy rooms! Everything you need is just a stone's throw from the hotel and don't miss their bar or restaurant either! Highly recommended and we will definitely stay here again when we return to Austin!
5,Best Staff Ever,"I travel regularly for work. I recently stayed at the Omni Austin Downtown. The hotel staff are among the most warm, friendly, courteous and helpful that I've experienced! The rooms were spacious and clean. I have nothing but good things to say about my stay. You can't go wrong!"
5,Great stay,I got a corner suite for a couple days was visiting family and going to a concert. very friendly staff from arrival and departure. will be visiting again soon. Room was very clean and up to par. I did enjoy the rooftop pool.
5,Great Stay - Great Staff,I would highly recommendation the Omni Downtown Austin. You feel very well taken care of. Their staff is professional and friendly. You will have a great night's sleep with a comfortable mattress and great pillows.
5,Pleasant stay in Austin,"Nice hotel, great amenities, nice staff. Complimentary spa water in the lobby, fruit and cookies at night. In the morning they put out water bottles in the lobby for guest using the gym or running outdoors, very thoughtful!"
5,Great All Around Experience,"We were traveling with 2 service dogs and had been discriminated against at another small B&B and went with a suite here. Lemons into Lemonade! Everyone at the hotel was supper nice and catered to our pups. The suite was very incredible, especially for the price, almost like an apartment. Close to everything downtown. Had a great time."
5,"Great Stay, Helpful Staff","The staff here was extremely helpful. On a recent business trip, I accidentally left some items in the hotel room. I called to the front desk and they went to secure the belongings. The only improvement I would recommend is more prompt response. They offered to FedEx the items to me for a nominal cost. I found that I needed to contact the hotel on at least three occasions to confirm shipment of my items over a four day period. I did not need the items urgently, but was concerned that I had not gotten a shipping tracking number for them. On the last time I called about the items, they had acknowledged and apologized for the delay, and covered the cost of shipping for me.Downtown Austin has a music-rich culture. That said, there is often music playing into the evening hours. If that kind of thing could keep you awake, the nightstand typically contains disposable soft foam earplugs.Its location is awesome, and within walking distance anywhere you might need to go downtown. Uber or Lyft in from the airport and avoid driving and parking if you stay at this hotel. On-foot transportation is the best way to get around. Tons of great places to get food and beverages are dotted around downtown Austin."
4,Great place,"Was here for a weekend, with a few other families. The hotel is very nice and the location is great. However, it should be mentioned, somewhere, that parking is not included or validated. It's actually pretty steep, but we had no other choice. Overall, nice hotel!"
1,Not what you expect from Omni,"FALSE ADVERTISING. Parking is not included. It is $48 PER NIGHT.My husband and I booked our 1 year anniversary weekend getaway at the Omni Downtown hoping for the Omni experience that you would expect to have. Instead, we met many obstacles. First, upon arrival I handed the check in the wrong card which was my mistake. I was tired after my 5 hour drive there. My bank requested a release of funds from my account. This required a email to be sent on the hotels behalf. DAVID POSADAS was the manager to help with this. RUDE RUDE RUDE. My bank was closing at 6 and requested a fax instead for faster processing. When I told him of this request he said and I quote “What is the difference between and fax and email?” When he finally sent the fax he was away for 15 minutes before returning and placing the confirmation in front of me and rudely saying “anything else?”. I have never had anyone at a hotel treat me as rude as this manager did.Second. AC does not cool. We had ours set at 63 at night just to make it bareable to sleep.Third. I brought my own HDMI cable to watch movies from my phone just to learn this feature is not allowed. I did report this to the front desk. To watch movies you must pay $19.99+tax for a ONE NIGHT RENTAL.Lastly, when we went to check out we spent 20 minutes in a elevator since ONLY 1 WAS WORKING FOR ALL 15 FLOORS. Glad there was no emergency that required a evacuation.This was my FIRST AND LAST TIME AT A OMNI."
5,A welcome experience,"Found previous guests clothing in our room upon arrival, but issue was handled quickly and professionally. Jay, the doorman, is the star of the show. He is such a happy, helpful and pleasant personality, my wife and I looked forward to seeing him each morning as we left and each afternoon when we arrived. Overall the rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and the proximity to downtown is great."
4,Austin 2018,"Beautiful hotel located right in the center of town. We got a room with a wonderful view of Austin. Rooms was a bit small but it was very comfortable. Everything was walking distance. Rooftop swimming pool was very small, didn't get to enjoy it. It was crowded."
5,Perfect Stay,"This was a perfect stay. Staff was exceptional the room was exactly what we asked for. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Well will stay again and look for Omni first wherever we go. The hotel brilliantly located. Just a short walk to great restaurants and the eclectic mix of eccentric shops, clubs, and culture for which Austin is so proud. Best of all it is a short walk to the bat spectacle of the Colorado River bridge and the wonderful running/walking trails."
5,Weekend,"Stayed here was great a mix development of hotel, offices and bank under one roof. Very convenient to restaurants , convention center 6 street entertainment district. Very nice rooftop pool, restaurant . Staff was just wonderful and helpful."
5,Five star service,"We checked in into one of the suite room and found s tshirt from previous guest inside the closet. We called the front desk to report our concern and five minutes later Jerry the HK manager arrived and inspected the room again. He apologized and offered us to move to a different suite but we refused. As we walked out to have dinner, the front office associate who checked us in, apologized to us about the mishap and told us that there will be a gift waiting in our room for us. When we got back from dinner, we found a bottle of champagne, strawberries cover chocolate and a card. Jerry also filled out our ice bucket as he over heard me talking to my husband about getting some ice this evening. We are so delighted with their service."
5,Smooth welcoming easy,"Attentive, efficient, great service! From front desk to valet area, staff were attentive to anticipate your needs before asking for them. The room was clean and smelled clean. If I had any recommendation, I would say to have the light turned on to welcome you to the room"
5,Great with kids,I had four kids with me and the staff was amazing and helpful at every turn. Omni is the best hotel for kiddos! The girls loved every minute of the stay and will be talking about it for weeks. Thanks to the awesome staff!
3,An excellent reputation tarnished,Self-parking gate didn't work for 2 days requiring constant visits to front desk to adjust billing. Concierge service inconsistent from very helpful to someone who was unfamiliar with areas and difficult to understand. Fresh fruit ordered in the morning was a single green apple.
1,Avoid this place - Awful Staff,"I have stayed at the Omni for business and this was the worst experience I have had at a hotel in years. The staff was rude and harassed my friends. They evicted them in a manner that makes me sick to my stomach. On top of that the building is old as can be, really needs a capital plan."
3,Recent Stay,"High Price for a extremely average hotel. Friendly Staff but way overpriced for the quality. The rooms need updated and the pool area is a joke. Small, dirty and uninviting even on a hot day. Parking is awful in and around the hotel."
4,Service and Location are supreme at The Omni Austin Downtown,"We stayed at The Omni Austin Hotel in Downtown Austin this past weekend for a visit with our son. The hotel itself has a great location if you want to hang out in downtown Austin and the 6th Street bars. The rooms are small, beds not so comfy, but the service at this hotel FAR EXCEEDS an expectations. The food quality at the restaurants is also excellent. The hotel shows some wear and tear but is very clean. The pool is rooftop and Austin is very hot in the summer months so the water was very warm. There are a few tables and fans and misters running by the pool bar. Great views of downtown from up there. The rooms and hotel are quiet, however, the outside street noise on the weekends is loud. It didn't bother us that much but for some that might. There is a patio door that opens with a super small balcony in the room too. Overall we would stay here again. Only major suggestion is investing in newer mattresses. Pillows are comfy but the mattresses are worn and not supportive. We are Omni rewards members and loved the daily water, and coffee/soda or tea delivery. The best things about this hotel are the location and service. So if you want to be a couple blocks to all the action and want top notch service this is the place."
4,What a delight,"Visiting from India and staying in Dallas, we went for a night to Austin. Choose the omni for its decent reviews but unprepared for the service. The hotel is large, attached to a business centre. The rooms are large too , no great view. But its the service that compels you. Every need and request was attended towpath enthusiasm and gusto, no need too small . They have the service quotient spot on"
1,"Great location, HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT","Horrible! If you want to be harassed by manager Joe Holman, stay here. My sister and I have never been treated so badly. I booked this hotel, unfortunately, for my sister's bachelorette party. There were 11 of us who flew here from California and Boston to have a great time together. Only my sister and I were staying in the suite I booked, which only had one bed and a couch pull-out bed. On Thursday night (the day we checked in), it was just my sister and I in the room listening to music on our iPhone. We didn't even have a speaker! Joe was just roaming the halls and knocked on our door at 9:30PM. I had put fun bachelorette decorations on the outside of he door with a magazine pic of a shirtless man (which I have done for 4 other bachelorette parties in the past without issue). We opened the door and he had ripped all of the decorations off and said it wasn't allowed on the outside of the door. I was upset that he had taken them down and crumpled them in his hand before even asking us to take it down, because I would have loved to put it on the inside of the door, but it wasn't too big of a deal to me. I just thought that was pretty rude, as I wasn't aware we couldn't put temporary decor on the outside of the door. He looked at some of the pictures of all the shirtless men I had put up in the room, and it was clear that he was upset about the decorations, which should have been none of his business because we would take it all off the walls before checking out. It was clear that he was a homophobe and wanted us out by his demeanor and tone. He said, ""This is a family hotel and a non-party hotel. I could hear your music down the hall."" We said that we found that hard to believe, as we were only listening to music on an iPhone, which, as everyone knows, cannot get very loud. We asked if there was a noise complaint, and he said no! If there was no noise complaint, why was he at our door? We also asked what time was their hotel's official quiet time, and he said 10:30PM. So we felt that he was being unreasonable by even knocking on our door, but told him we would keep it down (and we knew each night we would be going out before 10:30 anyway).Then Friday night, there were 5 people in the room (my two sisters and our two best guy friends who are gay), as more people in our group started to arrive.. our suite would be the room where everyone met to be with my sister. Joe showed up again on this night at 8:30PM (Still well before the official quiet time) and said there was a noise complaint, (which I don't believe was actually true). We said we were leaving soon to go out and would keep it down. We felt at this point, he just wanted us out because he knew it was a bachelorette party, he was disturbed by all of our bachelorette decorations, and now saw that there were gay men with us, so we wanted to make sure we were quiet. We honestly felt that it would be impossible because he said he heard our iPhone from down the hall on Thursday, but we would try.On Saturday night, I had planned for everyone come to our suite to have dinner (delivered) and for my sister to open presents before going out. We actually had the music turned way down while she opened presents so we could chat and focus on the bride, and we would be leaving shortly after. Well of course, Joe shows up, this time with police and other hotel staff to evict us, without warning. We all felt as though this was incredibly uncalled for, but sadly packed up our things and exited the premises. As we walked out, we could tell that the police officer knew it wasn't right but he had no choice. Other staff by the front doors of the hotel whispered to me they were sorry and that Joe does this all of the time.I remember when I booked the room, I had let the hotel staff know that it was my sister's bachelorette party. They need to let people know they should probably stay somewhere else, or they will get harassed by this man. I honestly believe that if I hadn't put decorations on the door, we wouldn't have been harassed by Joe or evicted because we were never being too loud or out of control. We had neighbors that were having a bachelor party a couple doors down and they told us they were partying in the room til 3am and never got a noise complaint. We have never felt so wrongly treated and disrespected. Here we were on the streets of Austin on our last night with no where to go, and my sister crying. As the person who planned this trip, I deeply regret staying here and not taking the reviews seriously. I feel horrible for my sister and our friends who were thrown on the street because this man had it set in his mind on Thursday that we were not welcome here.What I don't understand, is how this man is still working at this hotel. If you look at the other reviews, this guy is notorious for harassing guests and evicting them unfairly. DO NOT STAY HERE!"
2,Disappointed,We had a suite. We’re planning to stay 9 days. Ended upnstsying one night and then moving to another hotel. Our room was dark so we asked to be moved. Next room was still dark. No desk to work at. Furnishings shabby. Sheets were scratchy. Tiny TV. Internet connection poor.
5,The friendliest staff in Austin!,"We recently stayed at this location for a few nights... what a fantastic experience! The valet eagerly greeted us (though we chose to self park), the staff helped us with bags, and the entry was magnificent - an 18-story open-air atrium. It's breathtaking. We checked in later in the day (perhaps it was around 4:00 o'clock) and our room wasn't quite ready, so in return we were given a free upgrade and offered a suite for the remaining nights of our stay... didn't have to ask, haggle, or anything. They were eager to please!The rooms are beautiful, clean, and comfy. For business, you'll find high quality items and services; for pleasure, you'll want to take a nightcap and relax by the rooftop poolside bar! All expectations were exceeded!A couple other notable advantages are the proximity to the UT campus and state capital building. Also, the walk to 6th Street is about 2 minutes. You really couldn't ask for a better overall location to take in all that downtown Austin has to offer. A walk to river is about 10 minutes, and you can access anything/everything via scooters/bikes on the street that will cost you a couple of bucks.Omni Austin Downtown didn't disappoint, and we'll be back soon! Hope your stay is as enjoyable as ours was!"
5,Visiting Friends,"Wanted to stay in the city and this hotel was perfectly positioned. We stayed in one of their newly upgraded rooms which was very pleasant, 16th floor. Friendly staff, clean and good value. We used the valet which was priced accordingly for a city hotel"
4,Business trip,"Here for a business trip - 5 nights . Although a large hotel I thought they treated me well as an individual , especially the concierge . It’s centrally situated . Rooms pretty good size. Good breakfast. Good bar area. Good value."
2,Look elsewhere in Austin,"Front desk staff isn't really knowledgable when it comes to billing. Was told quite a few different things before arrival, during check-in, and during check out. Wouldn't stay here again based on the front desk staff."
5,5 Stars,"This is my second stay at Omni Austin for business and the cleanliness, location, and service is all exceptional. Five stars. A mile away from the University and right next to sixth street and congress gives you unlimited options for food, drink and entertainment."
5,"Location, location, location","The Omni is in the middle of everything. It is a short walk to 6th street, the Capitol, and even UT. The club level is perfect for a weekend getaway. On-site parking is especially nice for when you want to sample the myriad attractions outside of downtown. Book early, though. The Omni's perfect location is NOT a secret."
5,We'll be back!,"We were treated with white glove service - from the time we pulled into Valet, to check in/out to the Lobby Bar. Our room was awesome and very clean and comfortable. As we were leaving the hotel the first day, the valet guys gave us a map and pointed out some things we might want to check out. So helpful! The service was outstanding!"
5,Great stay,All of the staff is friendly & helpful. The hotel is walking distance to many local attractions. The beds are extremely comfortable with great pillows. Was here for business meeting and the breakfast and lunch were very good with large portions.
5,Nice Hotel,"I am a fan of omni resorts- the city hotels are solid but usually not too exciting... had stayed at an SPG across the street for work during the week but moved here over weekend. Beautiful suites and excellent customer service. I will return here for future trips. This chain truly honors and rewards their members and that, for me, is huge!"
4,Very nice comfortable stay,"Good sized rooms with efficient air-con. The hotel is huge, with attached office block. With the bar and restaurant situated in a large atrium overlooked by the offices. One male member of the bar staff was a little miserable, which was a shame, but overall the staff were friendly.The only issue I had was the noise at night. Very loud traffic/revellers on the street until about 2 in the morning and also very noisy people banging doors etc as they came back from 6th street etc at a similar time. The hotel supplies earplugs in the room, which says it all really!. Nice hotel but doubt would return because of the night disturbance."
5,Great Austin Location,"Very nice hotel in good location. It was extemely hot weather when we stayed there. At the lobby area, bottles of water and wash clothes were available for use after being in the heat. Nice touch. I would stay there again."
3,Nice.,"Room was nice and it was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. The location is good if you want to be near 6th street. Negatives: Panhandlers hanging around the location, there were two that got loud and vocal when I didn't give them money (I don't carry cash), very limited TV channels in the room-I missed all my shows finales, there is a movie channel available but I believe it was a $20 charge for the movies. WiFi didn't work at all. Parking was expensive. Weak fan and a/c in the room."
5,"Great Place to Stay in Austin, TX","High class hotel with phenomenal service. Easy access to a number of bars, restaurants, and entertainment in the area. Extremely clean and worth every penny. From the moment you enter the hotel, the bell service and front desk make you feel extremely welcome and this continued up until checkout. Highly recommend this hotel to anybody traveling to Austin."
5,Wonderful Trip!,"Very welcoming hotel with an AWESOME location. You can walk everywhere. Great amenities available at no charge (gym, fridge, microwave). Front desk, concierge and other staff were all excellent. Lovely large bathroom with a big shower! Would defn stay again!"
5,"Great location in Austin, Tx","The Omni has exceptional service in Austin, Tx. Their staff is very knowledgeable about the city and events. Good location in the city. Valet and self-parking with easy loading zones for unloading luggage."
1,Experience,We stayed at the Omni Hotel during my daughter's orientation for UT Austin and had a terrible experience. To start the mini refrigerator was broken and had a terrible odor. When I called the front desk I was told that it was not meant to be really cold and they could bring me a snack if I wanted something. Missing the point entirely...that it was stinking up the room. Next the remote to the TV was broken. No help here either. We saw a huge Roach with wings in our room. Disgusting. When I went down to the front desk the girl was very nice and was fine for ten minutes to talk to her manager. He said he would buy me an appetizer and a drink at the restaurant lol. I just laughed and said no thanks but they could move me out of the roach invested stinking room. She went back and they moved me. Oh and you do. It get free wifi unless you are a select guest and parking is 38 dollars a night for this place. Find another similar hotel like motel 6
4,Nice,"Great location, nice surroundings, Pleasant staff. I will stay again. Quite disturbing on my 2nd night I was woken up at 2 am by the fire alarm stating to leaving the building. which I did immediately. Once outside we all realized it was only the 3rd floor occupants. No one from the Hotel gave us any information or direction, so after about 15 minutes I returned to the Lobby and the employee behind the desk said we could return to the rooms if we wanted to. confused, concerned and clueless of what happened."
4,Great service and high comfort,"I visited Austin for the second time this summer, and was very pleased with the stay at Omni hotel. The room was spacious and clean and contained everything needed, and both free water and body lotion, shampoo etc was filled up every day. Bed comfort was great! The reception had several people working there, and the staff was very helpful, - I asked them for a couple of things in addition to recommendations, and they always solved it with pleasure. The pool at the rooftop was small but nice, and there was also a bar there. All in all very pleased with Omni. Location is also great."
5,Great breakfast,"I arrived off the redeye because of a flight cancellation, so I only spent 3 hours in my room! The room was clean and comfortable. The roof deck has a great view, pool was nice but small, and I wish they had sun umbrellas. The breakfast (Migas - eggs and chorizo, etc) was awesome. Staff super friendly and helpful."
4,Very Good Hotel,Was within walking distance of my business seminar which was great and at a reasonable rate. The staff was always timely and respectable. The parking lot is a little on the highside if you are driving or have a rental ($32/night) compared to other near by lots and other hotels but otherwise had a great stay and would go there again.
4,Nice place,Stayed for 3 nights with my wife. Small room. Beautiful renovated shower bathroom with lousy water pressure. Parking is expensive. Nice to be downtown but very noisy on 15th floor. A/C was not functioning properly which is tough when it > 100 degrees. Rooftop pool is small but nice to have as an amenity.
5,TMB Business,I have stayed at this hotel multiple times. Not over the top but rooms are nice and clean. Definitely geared towards business trips. Near everything in downtown. Only negative are the tight spaces in parking garage.
4,Great stay,My husband and I only stayed here for one night during memorial weekend but it's a very nice hotel and have no complaints. It is a very good location and would recommend staying here. Our room had a interior view but it was still nice!
5,Great stay!,Only downside to the whole trip was the sound between rooms. Feels like your neighbors are in your room. Everything else was great. Greet you with warmth every time you walk in. Rooftop pool and service were exactly what we needed.
5,"Great location, great accommodations","Was in Austin for a gathering at a church just down the street. Based on the room I was in there was complimentary happy hour and breakfast. The building is beautiful, as were the views. The noise from 6th street was definitely noticeable, but not enough to bother me or keep me awake."
1,Not as advertised,"AC failed, nexpresso machine was not working, several electric outlets did not work, a guy from the hotel opened our door at 10:00 pm., apparently there was a complaint that my daughters had the TV volume too loud. In my opinion it was not, but instead of invading our privacy and scaring my 4 and 6 year old daughters a phone call would have been appreciated."
4,Great location near 6th Street,Technically the hotel is only a block from Austin's 6th street entertainment district. However in the evening they lock all of the doors on the backside and you have to walk extra block to the front of the building. We had no problems with the Wifi . No free breakfast but Voodoo Donuts is only a couple of blocks away. Parking was expensive. Overall very nice but very 'business' feeling.
5,Lovely Hotel,"Great location, wonderful staff. Very nice stay in a great area of Austin Texas. Nice, clean rooms, joined the Omni Gold club and got free coffee and tea in the morning. Apples and water available at the reception area."
2,Pay forintwrnet,"Very didsappointed to find that hotels still charge paying guests an internet connection fee. As a business traveler I probably have 40+ stays a year with another brand The hotel itself was fine and the service was good, yet being asked to pay an additional fee to connect to WIFI was disappointing, Even more so given that I was staying in the executive lounge level. Obviously this was not conducive to getting business done."
1,Tired hotel in a great location,"The Omni Downtown is... tired. The carpet on the eighth floor has water stains and is worn out. Our room had a “smoking/damp room air freshener” machine running when we arrived. I wonder what happened prior to check in? Gross. The bathroom and nightstands were chipped and scratched. The bed was the biggest issue to me— mattress was hard as a rock. Linens were thin and scratchy. Pillows were so worn out that they completely flattened out to the touch. Between the bed and the loud music coming from 6th Street, I don’t think I slept all weekend. We were in town for UT graduation, but will be staying elsewhere next time until the Omni undergoes a much needed refresh."
4,great location,"Very comfortable rooms. We had an internal room on the 13th floor with our window into the lobby/bar and there was no noise on this floor. We never ate in the hotel but the bar is nice. The roof top pool is very small but good enough to cool down in, the pool bar wasn't opened at the times we used the pool. The price for parking is absolutely ridiculous ($32 for self park and $42 for valet per day) this and the fact we had to get our room key changed 3 times before it worked are the only reasons its not getting 5 stars. Bed and bed linen was very comfortable, rooms are well equipped."
5,WONDERFUL STAY,"Great stay at a superb hotel in downtown Austin. Great service and top notch room. I will stay here in all future trips to Austin Texas. Room was clean and well appointed, service was top notch, food was good and the bar service just what i needed."
5,Omni Downtown Austin,I was in town for business and opted to stay at the Omni. My stay was very comfortable and pleasant. I signed up for the select guest rewards program and highly recommend it. My room was on the 16th floor with a balcony. I'd stay here again on future visits to Austin.
5,Omni in Austin,"This place was great. Excellent staff! The location was perfect and walking distance to many areas. I would recommend checking in first prior to parking in the self parking lot. I was told that I can park, but then when I went there, the attendant told me that I had to check in first. That was minor though. Overall it was a great stay and I would recommend this place to anyone."
3,"It’s fine, I suppose","I was in Austin for business and the hotel was fine to stay in, but horrible to work in. The internet service was abysmal in my hotel room. I needed to work and the internet kept booting me off, pages wouldn’t load and then time out. It was the most frustrating experience. I did call the front desk and they forwarded me to their IT person, but it still didn't work. This is the 21st century and it was like using the internet from the 90's. I was not happy. It was very distracting to work in the lobby, which was the only place where the internet worked. I would recommend the hotel if I knew someone was going to Austin for fun, but not for work."
5,My Business Trip,This was an excellent hotel. I was in Austin for a business meeting for a client who was housed in the offices attached to the hotel. The proximity to 6th Street is great for entertaining clients. Even though I was there for a short time being downtown allowed me to soak all that Austin has to offer in the downtown area.
4,"Great Staff, Noisy Room","Everyone I encountered at the hotel was exceptionally nice, professional and helpful. The service was outstanding, but my room--after three tries with other rooms--was a bit noisy because of the extremely loud ice maker four doors down at the ned of the hall."
5,Austin at it's finest.,"Omni Austin had it all! Location, great service, friendly and knowledgeable staff, work-out and pool facility a huge plus. From the moment the door opens for you, the welcoming smiles from the front desk staff made you feel like your home. Great experience and great hotel. I'm glad I chose Omni Austin!!"
5,Pleasant stay,This hotel has an excellent location and is situated close to 6th Street and State Capitol in the heart of the old city. I really enjoyed the hotel atrium as a place where one can relax throughout the day. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was rather small but was comfortable. Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. The staff working at the reception was always very helpful with all the requests we had. They were very pleasant and professional. The Wi-Fi access in the room was reliable. They are many restaurants with reasonable prices and on 6th Street and beyond. The stay at this hotel was overall very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel to those visiting Austin.
5,Wonderful stay in Downtown Austin,"Had a great stay at the Omni in downtown Austin. The hotel was well located in downtown Austin. The staff welcoming and the hotel offered great facilities, such as a gym and roof top swimming pool. I would recommend this hotel"
4,Nice hotel in downtown Austin,Hotel service was overall excellent and the beds were very comfortable. Parking was expensive so glad we didn't rent a car. We came for a meeting and the meeting venue and banquet staff service was excellent. Food was also excellent.
3,Not worth the price they are charging,"I came here for a conference and was quoted $369 a night. This hotel, while adequate, was not worth that price. The main complaint was the horrible street noise, most hotels in loud downtown areas have some sort of white noise maker to drown out this noise. They did not provide this. Additionally, I felt the hotel was a bit run down and in need of a remodel. The tv in my room was so small, the blankets were uncomfortable and my coffee maker didn't work. The interactions I had with staff were all great. Omni needs to update the hotel and rooms and provide better amenities or they need to start charging less."
5,Great stay! Very Welcoming,Great staff and hotel. Room clean (a little small but had a big bathroom with great shower) and comfortable. Lobby bar was great to meet and mingle with co-workers. Food was good and there are plenty of great eatery's close by.
5,Omni Stay - Austin,"I would easily stay there again - centrally located - great service. Beautiful hotel, layout, lighting, furniture, great shower, quiet, nothing looks old or warn. Easy to get to - easy to get curb service! Everything is above average - you know you are staying at a special place, well maintained! Although you pay more you get more!"
4,Wery Nice Nice staff,"Most vas very good in general staff vas wery good, price vas a little to high especely garage, kan recomends to all whos going too Austin in Texas, good location and wery frendley staff, good food in the bar"
5,Great stay,I stayed there a week. It was a great experience. Highly recommend this hotel. Great location with tons of awesome restaurants and nightlife to boot. The staff was awesome and room was great. I’m always apprehensive about the bedding quality and I was not disappointed. Highly recommended!
5,Austin Downtown Omni,Great location and beautiful hotel. Staff was awesome. We enjoyed being able to walk to the capital as well as the entertainment district. We had a fantastic view of the capital from our room. We will stay here again.
5,Birthday Weekend,"Awesome!!! Pool was warm, service was friendly! Office workers would wave at you as if they were having fun too. Defenantly going back even since we live 30 miles down the road. If you go make sure you eat the breakfast!!! Absolutely one of the simplest most enjoyable trips I have been on."
4,It was great but...,"The stay was great. The staff was friendly; the place was clean, conveniently close to the areas I need to be. It was an overall great experience, but this hotel lacks some things I could get at a cheaper hotel: free parking, free breakfasts, a microwave and a minifridge in the rooms."
3,Okay stay,"I stayed here as part of a bachelorette party, and we were one of many that seemed to be staying at the Omni hotel. The concierges and valet were always very kind. They also had a mini fridge that they brought up to one of our rooms so that we could keep things cold. However, there was no free WiFi, which I didn’t appreciate because even the restaurants we went to had free WiFi. The pool was tiny for the amount of people that were trying to sit outside. There was also a ton of debris floating in the pool. At one point it basically coated the top. It was a rooftop pool so I understand that there’s stuff blowing around, but if that’s the case, the pool should be cleaned more often. My friend and I left early Sunday morning, and were told that the bathroom in the lobby was closed, which we found odd. The hotel was in a good location, and allowed us to get around easily."
4,"Quick Stay, Great Service","I travel alot for work and stayed at Omni Downtown. The Front Desk service was great. Rooms are 'roomier' than expected. If needed, I like to be able to take video conference calls and not look like I'm in a hotel room. This room provided enough space. And of course, the Lobby Bar stayed open late."
5,Nice,We are here for a conference and our hotel is quite good! Rooms are spacious and breakfast is good though same everyday with choice of eggs on how you want it. Overall quite good. Place is near the convention Center and there are lots of restaurants nearby
3,A Nice and Convenient Hotel,"The Omni Club Level hotel was nice and close to the capitol where I needed to be. The Club Level has minimal food options, the hors d'oeuvre's were not that great and the lounge is very small. Room service cheeseburger and fries tasted good though. Great room and nice view of the city."
2,Worst bed ever,"Worst bed ever had. Sank down in the middle. Had to sleep on the edge, which was not easy. On check out the bellman just stood a few feet was and watch my wife and I struggle to open the door and fight to get our four pieces of luggage out - worst ever"
5,Wonderful get away stay!,Great location with the hotel being located a block off 6th street and two blocks from the Capitol.The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The hotel bar was convinetly located amd had a wide selection. We didnt eat at the restaurant but what food I did see looked really good. The hotel was very quiet at night with a hotel security person on each floor. Pool area is located in the rooftop overlooking a portion of the city. Parking is located in the garage below the hotel and you can self park or valet.
5,Very Efficient,This location is extremely efficient because you are in the heart of Austin! You are literally walking distance from any type of food restaurant your stomach desires. Live music is right around the corner regardless of which direction you go. The only concern you should have is the cost of parking. Definitely ask about when you start trying to make reservations. Self park is $32/night and valet is $42/night.
2,Very expensive for below average room,"We rented the executive suite for the night, nearly 400 dollars for the night, it was described to us to be 633sqft and beautiful. Most sqft was walkway and bathroom. The price i paid was not worth a tiny living space and a bed."
5,Quick 1 night stay,The hotel was very clean and well appointed! The bathrooms are sleek and modern. (Bathroom could use better lighting for makeup application even though there is a great lighted makeup mirror!) Friendly staff! we would stay here again!
5,Excellent Choice,"The facilities and staff are extraordinary and the hotel is centrally located to the 6th street nightlife as well as Rainey's. Rainey's was a blast - great variety of people, food and drink venues and a short walk from the hotel."
5,Omni Downtown has it all,"They're attention to detail is excellent! From the valet staff, front desk and bar staff are friendly and efficient. Rooms clean and well organized. Bed is comfortable. Bar food is yummy! Need more outlets in rooms."
5,"Nice place, great location!","I stayed here because my son had recommended this hotel. It is close to UT-Austin campus, you can walk to campus from this hotel (if you love to walk). No need to rent a car if you don't mind walking. Restaurant serves great food and they have nice snacks throughout the day in the lobby area. Overall, had a great experience at Omni Hotel."
5,Perfect location in downtown Austin,"The Omni Downtown Austin is in a great location within easy walking distance of many restaurants and shops. Our room was spotless, with a comfortable bed and nice sized bathroom. The hotel café, Ancho, has a vast breakfast buffet for $21, with juices, fruit, omelets, cereals, meats and breads. Truly amazing. Tip: If you're in a hurry, go to the food kiosk adjacent to the café and grab a breakfast burrito. Yummy!"
4,"Nice hotel, good service","The hotel is good and the service attentive. The room was clean. We were there for a business meeting. We, however, were given a room located on the 16th floor where the outside noise did not permit us to sleep at night"
5,Great Stay,"Our visit was to celebrate a special Occasion, It was our Anniversary weekend..Our room (Suite) on the Club Level was so nice...The room was so Welcoming..(Good View)(Big Bathroom) Thanks to the hotel staff for sending up a bottle of Champagne & some Chocolate covered Strawberrys..The Breakfast & Happy Hour was very enjoyable. Everyone from the Bell Boy to the Housekeeping was very friendly & helpful...All of our requests was taken care in a very timely manner..(Less than 30 minutes) Really better than all of my hotel stays..We will recommend The Omni..Thank You Omni for a Fabulous Weekend!!!"
5,Work Hard - Play Hard,"Excellent downtown location; friendly and professional staff. Clean, tidy and comfortable rooms. Great concierge service - Cullen was excellent. Brittany in the bar was friendly, efficient, offered good beer suggestion and knowledgeable about downtown Austin. David Posada took care of us and handled our checkout - he left us with a great impression of the OMNI Austin Downtown."
5,very nice hotel --but don't watch the blurry tv,"I stayed here for a conference. The room was very clean, quiet and the bed and pillows were great. The hotel is in a great location to wander downtown and along 6th Street. The check in and check out were easy. I parked and left my SUV in the parking garage--a little pricey but safe. I had buffet breakfasts with the conference both days and they were the best I have ever had in a hotel. The eggs were real eggs, the breads/muffins were fresh, the fruit tasted as good as it looked and the bacon was crisp and warm. The only complaint I had is that the tv was blurry/hazy. The engineer came to look at it and told me it was the analog channels. I ended up just turning it off because the pictures were so bad. I expected clear viewing on the tv at an upscale hotel, but he told me this was not new and there was nothing he could do. I told the front desk upon checkout in the hopes they would do something about it. They apologized but didn't seem concerned."
5,Great Rooms,"For a corporate hotel inside an office building, they do a fantastic job! Most corporate hotels don’t have to try really hard because their clientele is built in already. This property is beautiful, rich and elegant. Our room even had a full size kitchen and a treadmill in it! I would love that for any extended stay! Sixth street is a block over, so a great location too."
4,Great stay in Austin,Stayed in the Omni Downtown Austin before on a business trip. Came back with my family. It is located conveniently close to Capitol and 6th street. Booked 4 months in advance for a good rate. No reasons to complain.
5,A Jewel of a Hotel,"You will read that the hotel is a little dated which is true. But it also packs some old school, brass décor, vintage vibes. This is a AAA Four Diamond property. I would recommend a suite-- ours had a fully remodeled kitchen (Kitchen-Aid appliances), quaint furnishings, and its own elevator. We also got one of the best sleeps ever and almost overslept check-out time (noon!) This is a great location with walking distance to 6th Street without the noise thereof."
4,Good Hotel,"The staff was very good and attentive. The food was outstanding and the bar was great. The little coffee stand was outstanding. The rooms were clean and spacious. I had a suite which was really nice with a separate bedroom, but the beds are too soft."
5,Excellent Hotel,"If we could give the hotel 6 stars we would. We recently stayed at the Omni Austin Downtown in one of their beautiful executive suites for a week while my husband recuperated from a heart procedure in Austin. The service, cleanliness, food in the restaurant and bar and ambiance were great. Thank you to David at the front desk, Brittany the rooms manager, housekeeping, concierges and bar staff for helping to make our stay so comfortable. We would not hesitate to stay here again next time."
5,Best Hotel in Austin,"The service, location, and cleanliness of this hotel is first class all the way ! I'd recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone that I know that wants to stay in Austin. Room service and hotel at the bar are better than you'll get at any other hotel. (try the pulled pork nachos)"
4,Nice stay,"The hotel was very clean, beds super comfy, a/c a little humid (had to keep in on about 64), hot shower, roomy bathroom, smaller TV. Door staff was excellent. Front check in clerk was not the friendliest and was not crazy about having to put up a $200 deposit hold for a 4 night stay. It has been a while for me staying in a hotel. Is this normal? Seemed a bit extreme. They already had my card and my information. Ancho's restaurant had friendly staff, but very slow. Food was mediocre at best. Took at least 45 minutes for 2 salads one with salmon and the other with chicken. We were the 2nd table in the whole restaurant. Room service bill was expensive $34 for quesadilla, chips and salsa. Chicken quesadilla was packed with sautéed onions with burnt places on the flour tortilla. The salsa trio all tasted the same and was served with greasy chips. I woke up serval times during the night with indigestion."
3,Hotel’s Okay,"All along I thought it was a pretty modern hotel since the outside looks like it but it wasn’t. The rooms are pretty outdated and the facilites inside as well. Asked for 2 double beds but there wasn’t any available so they gave us a king bed with a roll away instead. Asked for a decent plastic/paper bag but they gave me a shoe bag since they said it’s the only thing I have (perhaps the laundry bag is better?). We left an item in the room and waiting if it can still be retrieved, hopefully they find it since it’s a special item that my daughter needs. So far the guy we called is helpful but we haven’t received any update yet. Incidentals and other details on check-in and check out weren’t really told of informed which I think they should."
1,Worst bed I have ever slept on,"Save your money! This was the absolute worst bed I have ever slept on. You will get the same bed quality at motel 6 for a fraction of the cost. Shameful! The lobby is gorgeous, the location good, the room is ok. The bed just ruined everything. Thankfully we only stayed for one night. We really wasted our money. I am extremely disappointed."
5,"Great location, friendly staff","Modern clean hotel 2 blocks from Congress Street. Very helpful concierge who recommended activities and good restaurants for our first time in Austin, when our bathroom door was broken it was fixed immediately. I recommend this hotel"
5,"Quality Hotel, ideally located downtown, with excellent service.","On a recent trip to Austin, we chose to stay at Omni Hotel, which turned out to be an excellent choice. The hotel is of very good quality & reputation, with very friendly & courteous staff. the hotel is ideally located close by (within 2 blocks) of the dining & entertainment quarter (6th Avenue). The rooms are quite spacious, and the hotel represents very good value."
5,Girls Getaway,Great location! Excellent service. Club level lounge is amazing! They have breakfast and afternoon beverages with Tapas! Walking distance to great sites in Austin including the Capital building and Sixth street. Very nice business center to print your boarding pass.
1,Boo!,"Valet stole money, breakfast never came, engineer never came to fix cold water issue, champagne that was promised never came, and guest services never did anything about any of this. Bed was comfortable. All suites are not the same. Last one I stayed in was much nicer than the one I was out in this time."
2,Not impressed,"I’ve stayed at several Omnis; this one is way below average. Very dated; beat-up furniture, HVAC very poor. The bed was hard as a rock; more like something you’d find in a dorm room. The iron didn’t work. The hotel parking is very tight and very expensive. The atrium roof leaked badly.The area around the hotel is somewhat sketchy. There is a large homeless shelter a couple of blocks away, and there are homeless people and panhandlers on virtually every street corner begging for money. Austin has a significant homeless problem that they hope you don’t know about.I was here on business. If I return, I will stay somewhere else."
5,Deserves higher ranking,From the time we pulled in we couldn't have been treated better. Breakfast coupons and a note from the frequent guest program were waiting for us. I was in my workout clothes waiting for our room to be made up and I was approached by and employee offering a bottle of water. Also love the nespresso machine in our suite.
5,Great location beautiful rooms,Beautiful stay with great amenities in a great location of the city. The rooms were nice but the drink delivery in the morning was a highlight. Those small touches make staying at this hotel something I will seek out in the future when I travel
4,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel, not much of a view but the friendliness of the staff made up for the lack of a view. We enjoyed the location of the hotel, close to 6th street and within walking of most areas that we wanted to visit."
2,Service not up to standard,"Iron and hair dryer missing from the room, had to request a hair dryer twice before receiving one. No maid service for the first two days had to ring down to reception to request maid service. WiFi also not up to standard considering you charge for it."
3,Parking,"I visited and was pleased with the room, the nice buffet luncheon and the staff was adequate. What I did not like was paying the self park fees for a blooded garage where we had to walk through high water to get to and from the elevators. I thought management should have given some consideration on their parking fees."
2,Old & Outdated,"This hotel should be torn down or heavily remodeled, not just cosmetic. Thin walls, bad plumbing, loud HVAC, and loud freeway noise too. You feel like you stepped into the 70’s. 10 minutes to DT Austin"
2,BATHROOM,"The bathroom had trouble with Hot Water, lighting and Mold. The room was loud, I could hear music all night and the people next to me. I didn't like that they provided earplugs... So you know about the issue and earplugs are your solution? The room did not feel clean."
5,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel for a convention and it was very nice with lots of glass and a contemporary feeling. The staff was great. The room was very nice with a big King size bed, great pillows, desk, refrigerator, Keurig, snacks, ironing board, robe, hair dryer, granite counters, flat screen tv, great view, and very clean. Great towels too. It was $239/night, so not cheap, but nice. The pool on the roof was small, but nice. Of course, there is a bar in the lobby, and they have a kiosk for drinks and some foods, plus the restaurant with breakfast bar for $23."
2,Not much for the money,"The room was very small but close to the action. I asked if they had a free breakfast and got laughed at in my face. Not impressed. Won't stay again. Other hotels within two blocks offer better rooms, service and FREE breakfast. Cost me and my wife $53 dollars."
2,Out of Date and Overpriced,"I stayed at the Omni for 8 nights during SXSW this year, and was extremely disappointed in our stay. The hotel is woefully out of date for its price range. While it's clean and the staff is incredibly friendly / helpful, the level of the hotel is about that of a Hampton Inn from 10 years ago. We did not have working wi-fi for our entire stay (something simply not acceptable in 2018), we had no hot water one morning, the shower pressure was terrible, and the room lacked basic modern amenities like bedside outlets and a TV less than six years old. The hotel was perfectly fine, but it is priced and marketed as a much nicer hotel. They either need to cut their rates in half (even during SXSW) or they need to gut renovate. was extremely disappointed in my stay at the Omni for SXSW. To begin, the hotel is in desperate need of renovations, particularly for its price point and positioning as an upscale hotel. The room lacked basic amenities like bedside outlets, a television less than 10 years old, and a non-beat-up shower. Compared to a lower budget option like a Hyatt Place or even a nicer Hampton Inn, it was woefully out of date. On top of that, the wi-fi in our room did not work for our entire stay. I was told repeatedly by the desk staff this was because of the crowds for SXSW, which is a ridiculous excuse. I have stayed at the Omni and other Austin hotels for many past SXSWs, and I have never had this problem. There is no reason a large hotel of this price range shouldn't be able to handle something as basic as working wi-fi when it is full. No excuse. One morning, we had no hot water, another unacceptable situation at a hotel of this price range. Last, three different days we returned to our room at nearly 3pm, after having been out since 9am or earlier, to find it had not yet be cleaned or serviced. If the Omni is going to price itself as a luxury hotel, it needs to significantly improve the quality of its service and rooms."
3,Bathroom could have been more clean,The bathroom had hair on the floor and a used contact lens upon arrival. Pretty disappointing for such a large hotel. We loved the area but the bathroom needs to be more clean. I didnt eat or drink at the hotel so cannot comment on that.
1,"Gross room, sparse amenities",There are piles of brown dirt in the corners of the bathroom from many bad mop jobs. The edges of the tiles in the bathroom are STAINED BROWN. If this wasn't a required work trip i'd move hotels right now. And Wi-Fi? Don't ask. I'll do my 2 days and won't come back. I've stayed in classier motel 6s in the middle of Kansas. $69/night rooms for $240 basically.
3,First visit to Austin,"We chose to stay at the Omni during our first visit to Austin to be within walking distance to downtown. The hotel was nice and the rooms were clean. I would have given the hotel four stars if it wasn’t for the added charges to our bill. When we checked out we had two separate charges worth $75 from the bar. We did buy three drinks for $33 but chose to pay with our debit card instead of having it charged to the room. However, when we checked out the same charge plus another charge for $42 was on our bill. After complaining they did remove the charges but I would definitely review your bill before leaving."
2,"good structure, terrible service","Omni is a big hotel with nice rooms and structure but i had a terrible experience with the service. I asked to change my reservation stay and shorten it one day and they agreed (this was 3 days before i left), but at the last time they charged me a penalty charge. After that i was charged in my credit card for a different value, that was not in my receipt, even more than the penalty charge, and it's extremely hard to talk to someone there that is willing to help."
4,Great place to relax after ACL,"This place was great, felt like real elegance from the minute you walked in the doors.The desk staff were very friendly and informative about the hotel and surrounding area.The room itself was nice and spacious with a king bed and bathroom with shower and bath.All amenities were available (gels, shampoos etc, robe, safe, ice machine, mini fridge). All the home comforts away from home.The only downside was the lack of soundproofing between adjoining rooms, I heard literally everything next door was discussing - not helped by them being extremely loud. Due to the hotels noise policy (which perhaps only applies to big weekends like ACL), my neighbours were escorted out of their room one night by hotel management and a police officer due to the number of complaints they had generated. I have to complement the way the hotel handled this, promptly, professionally and with minimal fuss or bother to neighbours. I’d stay again purely for how impressed I was with how they dealt with that."
3,"OK, but lacking Coffee and Wi-Fi","I read the reviews prior to my stay, and frankly I was a bit scared based on some of them. But overall I had a pleasant stay from a Sun-Wed. My timing was likely part of that as I likely missed the weekend party crowd that seems to draw the ire of many guests. There are some pretty dire signs near the elevator warning of loud noise and guests.Overall the room was quite nice, and clean. I had an inside atrium room and found it to be plenty quiet. The bed was very comfortable and everything was reasonably up to date and clean.On the downside, coffee and wi-fi. The staples of any business traveler. They have a Peets coffee in the lobby, but it doesn't open until 6:30 am. When I asked about coffee at 5:30 am I was told there is a Keurig in my room. Then the wi-fi. Pay for wi-fi? Come on the year is 2018. Even if you join their select traveler program, unless you book direct with the hotel you can't use it.I didn't have an event there so I can't speak to it as a meeting place. The location is fantastic, but if you need wi-fi and early coffee like me, you should look elsewhere."
5,First Visit to Austin,"The Hotel was located in a great location for walking downtown and even over to SOCO. Rooms and staff were fantastic. Food, especially breakfast was well above average and loved the Club floor amenities."
5,Highly Recommend,Omni hotels are so comfortable and the customer service is outstanding. The location was perfect for this visit and was within walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Very impressed with the staff.
5,Perfection,"Our experience at Omni was flawless. Every interaction with staff was exceptional. We could not have had a better experience. My plan is to refer our business associates and friends to use an Omni while traveling. When planning our vacation destinations, I'll definitely check to see if you have a resort in the destinations we choose."
5,Customer service excellence,"Very nice location, clean rooms and customer areas; quiet hallways; convenient bar and restaurant areas; business center is efficient and well stocked with supplies; staff is very visible and accommodating. Concierge is knowledgeable and experienced. No problems at all."
1,Complete Deception,"Where do I even start? This is my first and last time ever staying at an Omni hotel. Deceptive trade practices here I feel. I booked this site and I thought the rate I was quoted was the rate I would pay-wrong! I received an email confirmation stating my total rate for two nights would be $428.14 taxes included. Upon checkout I received an email of my final bill and it was $497.42 unbeknownst to me I was charged to park in their garage as a hotel guest at $32 a night plus tax! There was nothing stating that guests would also be forced to pay to park at their hotel. Nothing on the website, nothing at the front desk, and nothing in the garage. In fact, the garage is totally deceptive and a separate card swipe is for guests to swipe their room key making it appear as if parking is free for guests. My final bill that was now to be $497.42 was NOT, when I checked my bank account they actually took $528 with no further invoices as to why the price just keeps going up and up! Is Omni this desperate for money they deceive their guests financially? And, on their website once you reserve a room there is no going back-no cancellations so I could't back out if I even tried. The wi-fi can we talk about that? The website claims wi-fi is included, yet another deceptive act by Omni. You cannot get a single page to load with the wi-fi they claim is included. They want you to pay more money for wi-fi, a service that other hotels and even McDonalds gives to it's customers for free (parking is given free too by these other entities). The rooms are not glamorous or luxurious, we could have stayed at a Holiday Inn for the exact same layout and room we got! It wasn't worth ""$187"" a night (which is really $264 a night because it's all deception). No warning on the website that there is a street called 6th Street a block up and every night you will be awakened by the sound of drunks yelling, screaming, and blaring their horns. Every night from 2:00 am to 3:00 am we were rudely awakened from our sleep from the loud noise coming from below even though we were 8 floors up. They need to sound proof their rooms better! The water pressure from the shower-there was none. We left Omni angry, feeling ripped off, and deceived over a weekend get-away that was supposed to be relaxing and fun exploring the Capital and recreation areas of Austin."
4,Very good location and service,"Nice downtown location close to restaurants and 6th street. Good business meeting room. Hotel bar was a bit expensive, and good service. The room overlooked the atrium and a bit strange to look into other offices and atrium. Room was okay and had staples, however, nothing spectacular. Nice touch to have robes in room. Cleaning service was fine, and not consistent."
5,"Great Hotel, Great Omni","The Omni Downtown--As always, This is a very special Hotel- The Club Level is The Way to go. The room and bed are perfect for a great night sleep, Great Location for walking, Breakfast excellent. Grandkids Loved the Stay"
5,Quality All Around,"I was in Austin for a medical procedure, and needed a quiet, restful environment. We had a suite for a week, and had a uniformly positive experience. The rooms were comfortable and quiet, staff were courteous, prompt and helpful, and fulfilled our every request with a smile. Room service (much needed for a couple of days!) was prompt and the food was great. We especially appreciated the housekeeping staff. Also the Omni's commitment to providing a quiet, restful environment."
5,Great room with a view,"Alexis really surprised us with a beautiful suite during our stay over the weekend. We had to come in for business and chose to stay there and though we had no reservation, she was able to get us a room and she was so pleasant to work with. Loved the patio view from the living area and the spacious bed and bath area."
5,gracious and spacious,Excellent staff both at front desk and conference catering – they really seemed glad we were there and wanted our business. Food much better than one would expect from conference catering. Excellent beds. Sign up for Select to get free coffee.
5,Downtown Austin,"Within walking distance to 6th St, the Warehouse District, 2nd St. the Capitol and more. Park and Walk to these areas. Also a good base for the University of Texas, the Hill Country, Lake Travis, the Salt Lick Bar-b-que and more."
3,Omni Austin,This hotel is in need of a remodeling the rooms are dark and it was loud when I was there. (they were rerouting traffic due to the marathon). The elevators take forever so I was not sure if all were in service. The staff was nice and all else was adequate but there are nicer hotels in a better part of the city.
5,Austin stay,"Hotel is very nice, however the rooms are a little outdated. You will receive quick service in a very clean atmosphere and a good nights sleep. Would use them again. Gave a 5 star because it is the Omni the location is great close to food, business and cultural activities."
2,Not worth the price...,"Extremely unimpressed and disappointed at the service and my overall experience at this hotel. The service was not what you would expect at an Omni hotel. The front desk staff was short, hurried, and not at all helpful. The room was in desperate need of some love and some upgrades after hard use from hotel guests. There was never anyone waiting at the entrance to help you with your bags or open the door for you. This is not a luxury hotel, by any means."
5,Five days in Austin,"I didn’t know what to expect as the reviews were mixed but if you booked this hotel, you will love it! First of all the customer service is amazing! We arrived on Valentine’s Day and were greeted with champagne and chocolates in the lobby. The customer service reps and manager were there to greet and welcome everyone. Then the concierge, Miles, did not steer us wrong in helping choosing local music venues and restaurants.The location is perfect if you are exploring the downtown area, close to everything. So that also means you are close to 6 street parties..... which is loud and can be heard in the room. That being said the hotel recognizes this and offers ear plugs, as the noise is out of their control.Honestly can’t think of any draw backs about this hotel......book it! Enjoy.... I know I’ll be back."
5,Austin Marathon traveler,"Very nice , professional staff. Ready to answer questions or help with bags. Room was very clean with plenty of shower towels. The parking garage was easy to maneuver with a convenient elevator making access from the hotel easy."
5,Awesome Place,"Fabulous room with an excellent location. The hotel is grand and luxurious and within walking distance to famed sixth street and all the action. The rooms are clean and the staff was warm, friendly, and very helpful. The restaurant in the lobby has a delicious breakfast and there is also a nice bar located in the lobby."
5,Had a great stay,"Everyone was very nice, it was very clean and people were very helpful. The building is upscale and half office professional office space with which it shares an atrium/common area with a restaurant and bar. It's a cheap Uber ride to Rainey St or 6th St.Room was very nice and clean."
5,Great business hotel,"This hotel is modern, clean and located in downtown Austin. The club floors have a good breakfast layout that’s nice before early morning meetings. Rooms are quiet and easy to work from. There is a cab stand at the front door for those that don’t Uber."
3,Just okay,"Depending on what your purpose is for coming to Austin, this hotel may or may not be your top choice. For me, it was close the the convention center which I was in town for a conference for. My preferred hotels were booked by the time I knew I needed to make reservations to come out here, and being that Omni was a big chain as well with a loyalty program, I felt like I'd try it out. Booking and check in was fine, hotel employees are just ok, they weren't chipper or rude, but they didn't exude a hospitable attitude. Front door guys are a bit robotic and expressionless. Hotel itself is nice and rooms and clean. It is kind of situated near 6th street to keep in mind the noise levels at night. There is a coffee bar that stays open to the afternoon, and some dining options, but nothing to write home about. I guess eat there if you have no other options, but if you have options, spend your money elsewhere. The food is lackluster but surprisingly doesn't have hotel prices footed onto the bill. the prices were reasonable. My main issue with my stay was the fact that the hotel staff gave me bad info about transportation services that was being offered from the hotel to my convention (which was advertised on their hotel lobby marquee as well as multiple sources online). This resulted in me having to get a taxi when one of the selling points of staying here was the shuttle option to kind of justify the higher cost of staying here versus the other options I had. Secondly, I left something at the hotel and they shipped it to me and charged me, without me authorizing them to do so. It was not cheap by any means and for me spending as much as I did, I would appreciate a reduced shipping charge or it being free for the amount that I did spend staying here. Maybe I'm spoiled by other resorts but the principle is, don't charge my card when I didn't authorize for you to do so. Also, my jacket came stained, so it's pretty much not wearable anymore. TL:DR - I personally won't stay here again if I had to come back to Austin. Aside from the clean room, there are better options when it comes to hospitality, dining, proximity, etc. The service here was not worth my stay and I am disappointed with my first experience as an Omni guest."
5,Great hotel close to nthe action,"The Omni is part of a glass-enclosed office complex - pretty - and very close to 6th street (bars and clubs) and Congress (main thoroughfare). You can walk throughout downtown, or to the Capitol and the university. Comfortable beds, coffee shop down in lobby, rooftop pool."
5,Good central location,"Property is clean and up to date as always. the room was very nice and the views are good. the staff is very friendly and the check in process is very fast, no waiting in line. the only suggestion for the hotel is to lower the valet parking rate as I personally think $42/night is very high. I didn't see that when I booked the room so the savings I thought I was achieving was lost to the parking fee. It is $32 if you self park which is still very high with the local garage market being $15/day. just a suggestion."
5,My Favorite Hotel in Austin,"I love this Hotel. I love the way the staff treats me and I like the overall architecture of the building. It's in a fabulous location. Pickup and drop off, when friends come to get you, is really easy. I find the staff to be very attentive and they seem to genuinely want your stay to be perfect. And they allow you to bring your dog (size limit). That makes them perfect for me."
4,"No jacuzzi, no breakfast!","The room was nice, the staff always friendly and helpful. However, if you are there for a convention be prepared to be tired and sore! When you get back to your hotel (all uphill from the convention center) don't expect to be able to relax in a jacuzzi! There isn't one. Also, with the price of the room, you would think breakfast would come with it. No breakfast, no free evening drinks, no extra amenities at all! Just not what you would expect from an upscale hotel! On a good note, the bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel was very clean and quiet!"
5,Downtown Austin Omni,"Beautiful hotel with excellent customer service! This hotel is located in downtown so you will hear more noise due to downtown night life/ rowdy hotel guests. My stay here was enjoyable nonetheless. Thanks, Omni staff!"
5,Nice!,"Front desk was super nice in trying to place us near our friends, but unable to... bed and pillows were comfy and soft.. room was spacious with a nice mini bar... which we didn’t indulge in d/t price🤨 Bathroom nice and roomy.. would def stay again! Oh and parking is $30+, but across the street is $10."
5,Excellent Experience,I just spent the weekend at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. The service was superb. It was evident everyone we encountered wanted to make sure our experience was excellent. I highly recommend this property.
4,Stellar service team and location,+1 the many reviews that focus all kudso to Omni Downtown's team. From the doormen to housekeeping they are service-oriented and execute well. Shoutout to CJ at the door who rescued a week-long business trip by retrieving a backpack I left absentmindedly. Add location as a benefit - walk to Congress and 10-15 mins taxi ride to Penn Field and Domain commercial areas. Area for improvement: investment in updated furnishings especially the bed.
1,Terrible Experience,Nothing i paid for in the romance package was delivered hence i did not finish my stay with the hotel. The manager was unable to provide any resolution to the issue as well. I would have rather stayed at home than wasting my time at your hotel.
4,Omni does not give free wifi,"Overall my experience was good at the Omni, However I was greatly disappointed when I went to check out and found that I had to pay for wifi. In almost every hotel I've stayed at whether it was within the states or during international travel for business wifi was always a complimentary add. Not so at the Omni"
3,Expected better,"Pleasant service, but dusty room, no refrigeration or microwave, mediocre breakfast, no turndown service (expected with the upgraded club room). Thin walls (could hear conversations and groaning from adjacent rooms). This hotel will not be my preference for future visits."
5,"Wonderful location, superb service",Great location and every employee treats you so kindly and with respect. I always felt tended to and never ignored. The atrium view hotels are fun and give you a great view. The space on the lower level was very generous and comfortable.
3,Beautiful Hotel,"The hotel was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. However, there were drawbacks to the location. Entrance to hotel was difficult due to Austin traffic. Austin traffic is the worst and hard to navigate due to one way lanes going opposite of where you want to go. Being town town we were awoken in middle of night by sirens and we were on 11th floor. I was also shocked to find our parking was not included. Cost us an additional $45 for parking. That was my fault for not asking. I assumed since we were paying $250 a night the parking was included as there wasn't anyplace else to park. Hotel itself was beautiful and clean but I would not stay here again due to location. Location is why I gave it a 3."
5,Terrific Service and experience,Everything at the Austin Omni was first rate --the service was exceptional. We would recommend it highly. Our overall experience was outstanding. The training of the staff very good. We will stay here the next time we come to Austin.
5,Had a Blast!,"Visited Austin for my birthday weekend (Jan 20-21, 2018) and as a Employee of a Omni Hotel in San Antonio, I was definitely treated like an employee! Originally had booked a double queen due to having two other guests with me. Then when I checked in, around 8:45-9:00pm I received a upgrade to the one of the Executive King Suites on the 18th floor! Gorgeous room/view. Wish my hotel looked like this! My two other friends and I decided to use Uber all night for transportation. Very convenient for being close to 6th St and Rainy St.Before booking this hotel, I read some really nasty reviews about people being kicked out of their room for no reason when they weren't in their room and after reading those reviews, I was debating between this one and Barton Creek Resort. But after talking to some co-workers, I'm glad I chose this specific one. I had heard Barton Creek was/is undergoing renovations.Staff was excellent! Very friendly. I want to thank the ladies at the front desk (Wish I could remember their names) that checked me in, were super sweet and kind to me.Parking- underground parking garage. If you're a hotel guest, you can use your room key to let you out instead of paying the parking fee *** just a heads up!To summarize my stay, I'd definitely come back! Beautiful hotel! Loved the staff that I interacted with. Location. Everything was just right! Thanks for helping make my birthday weekend/getaway so special!"
4,Plus & Minus,"Great location - to enjoy & walk around Austin. Rooms nice & large......Had a k-cup & express on room. The food on the 14th floor was fresh, tasty, and the room was kept very clean. The staff is very friendly & helpful.. Needed a new mattress & the Valet parking was absolutely too expensive. Elevator are a problems when the one to the 15-19 floor is not working."
5,"Great Location, great hotel","Very friendly staff, great location for getting around and seeing music and so close to all the amazing shopping and restaurants. The room was really comfortable and they were completely ready for us when we arrived. They were clear ahead of time that they might not be able to accommodate an early check in but they did and when we needed to change rooms (because of our error) they did that no problem. Would definitely stay there again"
1,Bad experience,"Bad experience, initial service was bad. When I checked inn there was no valet personnel outside of the hotel, so I had to park my self, on a very uncomfortable garage. Went inn checked inn, didn’t really feel greeted by the staff. Went inn the room finally, only to find out that the beds on my room where extremely small, I wish I would have known that. Finally I saw a fridge stacked w goodies such as wine and a few drinks and I said to my self well that’s nice from them at least something good in the room. When and try to grab a drink only to find out the fridge didn’t work and everything Inside of it was warm. I don’t think I will ever spend another night at a Omni hotel. And I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. As my first experience at a Omni hotel was very bad. I do have to mention something that I really like was the valet personnel when I checked out and departed, they were the nicest gentlemen out of the entire crew. And where very helpful."
4,Good stay wish it had windows to the outside,"My 50th birthday my husband took me to Austin for a relaxing weekend. He didn't think to ask if the hotel windows looked outside ( they looked over the inside of the hotel and the offices across the way)!When I got out of the shower, I grab a towel that was full of hair. Disgusting!!! My husband called down and housekeeping Manager, Jenny Gutierrez came to the room. She was extremely apologetic and interested in making sure we felt accommodated. She gave us coupons for breakfast.Breakfast downstairs was amazing!!!We would consider staying here again, but will definitely check the towels."
5,Amazing,I usually go to Omni Downtown Austin hotel. People are very warm and professional. They listen to my needs. They are very consistent with their service It is an area that we have everything close. I highly recommend this hotel
3,This is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed in.,"The hotel was extremely loud and we didn't get any sleep from the running and screaming in the hallways. Every floor should have a monitor between 2:00-3:00 when the bars let out. We were absolutely exhausted in our training class. We love to have a great time too, but we don't run up and down the hallways to have it."
4,Outlet inconvenience,Everything was nice exception of not being able to find the phone plugin outlets to charge our phones conveniently .. had to take in and off trips to the bathroom to charge our phones and iPads ..I hope this can be fixed soon otherwise I’d still recommend this to my business partners and other people
4,Very Nice!,"Overall the experience was a pleasant one. My wife booked us a room there as a surprise for my birthday, she got a package deal that included breakfast the next morning. We stayed on a Saturday night till Sunday morning.Check in could be done online but we couldn't as she booked the room but used a card in my name. If the names don't match, no online check in. We were still able to check in before 3 pm though.It has a parking garage. $32.00 plus tax to park yourself as an overnight guest. $42.00 for valet. Both allow unlimited in and outs and valet has a text feature.The staff was very nice. The room was comfy and clean. The view was just the office space across the way. The hotel bar made good drinks and we had the breakfast Buffett which had a decent spread. Lots of fruit and cold meats. Cereal with Milk and Soymilk. Eggs, pancakes, an omelet making station, several types of sausage, etc.Now the two downsides. One the room never got cool. We had the cold air running the whole time but I couldn't use the sheets while sleeping as it was too warm. 2nd was breakfast package, we talked to 4 or 5 people on the phone Saturday about how it worked and finally got told you could order to your room or go and eat downstairs and it was included in your bill up to 50 or 60 dollars.We got home Sunday to find a charge of 47.00 on the card we used. I called the Omni and had to talk to 2 people and then a manager to find out they messed up and charged us for the breakfast. They returned it right then but of course I won't get the money back for a few days. They were friendly about it but it is annoying how much effort we had to go through to figure out this package deal.Overall though it was a nice place and a fun visit. I enjoyed my birthday."
4,Enjoyable stay while attending a conference,"Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Omni Austin Downtown. The hotel was very nice, and I found the staff to be extremely courteous and helpful. Although I didn't get to use it, the rooftop pool area looked very fun and provided a great view of the city. I did have issues the last couple days with the water pressure and temperature of the shower in my room. Otherwise, I found the room to be comfortable and spacious. The location is great for those people wanting to experience 6th Street, and the convention center was a fairly easy walk each morning. It is worth noting that the surrounding area had a lot of homeless people, although I didn't notice as many immediately near the hotel property."
5,Professional service and wonderful rooms,"Stayed at Omni Hotel Downtown. I was there for meetings at the convention center. About six block walking distance. I was able to check in 2 hours early and had a late check out while waiting for a late afternoon flight. King size bed in guest room was very comfortable and roomy. Turn down service was very much appreciated after a long day of meetings. Walk to/from convention center less than pleasant, with many homeless people and smelly streets."
4,Beautiful with friendly staff,"The Omni at Downtown Austin is beautiful. My husband and I had a ""child free,"" weekend and we could not have chosen a better place to stay. The staff was friendly and helpful in every way imaginable. It's central location to all the best restaurants and activities makes this a desirable hotel. We will be staying again!"
3,Just ok,"I'm disappointed. Omni is usually a safe bet. There was a whining noise in the room, so I ended up checking out at 7am. It was New Year's so the hotel was booked with no other rooms available. The hotel bar was fabulous! The bartender was mixing magic. My group has discerning tastes. We ordered a variety of drinks and she nailed it every time. The lobby and bar are open so it's cold in the winter and I assume warm in the summer. So dress to accommodate."
5,Perfect Location,The staff was friendly and helpful. We were within walking distance to all the fun spots we wanted to see on our trip. If we needed directions the staff was quick to give us easy to follow instructions with maps and recommendations. We would definitely stay here again.
5,3 night Stay in Austin with grown kids,"I can’t say enough about how cool this hotel is!The lobby, the restaurants and the funky views!We will be back EVERY time we head to Austin!!!I gave my kids the King beds and I took the pull out couch.It was better than most beds you sleep in!!!"
4,Fine for business but that's about it,"We booked this as a couples' weekend away. The location of downtown is fine during the week but more deserted on weekends. Our room had an awful view of the internal atrium and offices across the atrium--thankfully it was a weekend and no one at the business seemed to work on the weekends so we could get some light in our rooms. The wifi never worked; I had to call repeatedly for tech assistance where they added each device manually. But everytime we left our rooms, we had to ask to reconnect. I have stayed at other Omnis and was underwhelmed. Fine for a business trip and that's about it."
5,"Fantastic stay, close to everything","Loved this Omni, the location is fantastic we were able to walk to everything we wanted to do or a short Uber ride away. Beds were really comfortable and the room and amenities are what you would expect with an Omni property. Staff were awesome, we stayed over New Year's Eve and they beefed up the security to keep down parties which was nice."
3,New Year in Austin,"I have stayed at this hotel in the past, knew the location and didn’t want to try something else. The location is good, staff is friendly and valet is on point. Several things we didn’t like,felt they were unnecessary like $40 per night for parking, shouldn’t over charge customers, of course we did it anyway for convenience. The room is just ok nothing special. Had an issue with our room but they were fairly quick to fix, there were a few other things that just left us the feeling they didn’t care if we stayed there or not. I like the Omni Chain but with all of the options in Austin now, it’s time to move on."
3,An Underwhelming New Year's Experience,"Don't expect to use anything other than plastic cups when renting a $1,500 per night Owner's Suite at this location. Front desk will also threaten to kick you out of the hotel if you use the world ""party"" to describe your gathering. Hotel outside view from rooms is the slums of Austin with a homeless shelter displaying their porta potties proudly on the street. The office tower on the opposite side of the building got the beautiful downtown view. Don't waste your time at this poorly planned and run property."
5,Beautiful Hotel!,"Perfect hotel in a perfect location. There are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. We parked our can when we arrived and didn’t have to use it again until we left. We loved the hotel, it was clean, comfortable and the staff was very friendly. They are pet friendly and actually mean it, unlike some hotels. We didn’t get a chance to check out the pool (just not enough this time) but it looked amazing and we can’t wait to come back."
3,It was ok...,"We stayed at the Omni the week between Christmas and New Years. Set back from 6th street, it is a great location. They give you ear plugs in the room in acknowledgement of the loud street noise that can obviously happen. Which was very nice. We found most of the noise came from what seemed to be incredibly thin walls. Every time someone played music or moved around in their room, you could hear it. The running down the halls and slamming of doors didn’t help either. Everything was just ok. Not great, nothing went the extra mile. Just ok."
1,Price Gauging,"Over charged and charged for products pre-ordered that never received.... AND actually refused to take it off the bill, but chose to argue with me even after admitting that I'm right. He seemed to become upset when I asked for the GM."
4,"The stay was very good, staff were really welcoming and helpful from coming to leaving. Very clean as well. Happy there","The stay was very good, staff were really welcoming and helpful from coming to leaving. Very clean as well. However they should do a better job at fixing that elevator or at least put a sign out by it to let others be aware. The thing was working improperly and it was frustrating. Happy experience at Omni and would go again"
5,Beautiful Hotel Would Return,"I stayed here for just one night for work and wish I had stayed longer. The hotel setup is unique - the lobby connects to the lobbies of adjacent office buildings and it is all in the ""open"" with a very high glass ceiling over it. It gives the illusion you are outside but you aren't So my room faced this atrium and was so quiet, more so than if it had been facing a regular city street I believe. People were friendly. The room was very attractive and the bed super comfortable. I love hotels with robes, and they had robes so that was a plus. I got Texas Eggs Benedict for breakfast, delivered to the room, and it was delicious - the eggs were cooked perfectly even though it was delivered via room service. The service was very fast - faster than they said even, which was appreciated. We had a work meeting there and the woman in charge of setting it up for us, Jamie, was a pro. I'd highly recommend having work or personal events there, if that's what you are considering."
5,This is my favorite,I love staying at this hotel. The attention to detail is truly amazing. The attention of the staff is impeccable and their friendliness is an added bonus. The perks of being a member of their frequent guest program are first class. I am highly recommending the Omni chain and in particular this hotel.
4,"Stay at Omni, Austin","Overall, I was very satisfied with my week long stay in the hotel. The staff is extremely kind and helpful and the hotel is ideally located. Room was clean and quiet. The service is also excellent. Many restaurants nearby."
5,Very good to excellent hotel,Rooms were great. Loved the minibar. Bathroom was OK. Service was great. Breakfast buffet could be better. Food was not fresh and it was expensive. Meeting rooms were good. Location is great. Carpets need to be replaced.
5,Excellent High Quality,"Omni Hotels are consistently the Best in Class- The Hotel Rooms, Location, Food, Beds, Fitness Room- were Clean, High Quality, and it made our Business Trip a memorable experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a great place to stay in the heart of Austin Texas."
5,Excellent service,It is pricey but you can clearly see what you are paying for. They staff was excellent. Always willing to help. Only thing I didn’t like that much was the breakfast. We paid for the buffet and the food was just ok.
4,Omni downtown Austin,"Beautiful hotel, great location, and great service at check in. Room was spacious and clean. Price was affordable. Limited outlets in the room and not quite enough space for coffee maker but other than that, great experience."
4,Good experience overall,Most things very good. Food at Restaurant was not very good. The time it took in the morning to get a cup of coffee and muffin was to long. There was only one attendant at the station. Valet parking was great and fast.
5,Hotel is very comfortable and service is great!,"My husband and I stayed several nights for business. We were greeted warmly. Our room was nice size and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom pretty, a nice size, in good condition and very clean. The restaurant and bar was great to have in the hotel. Service was wonderful and the food was good. We will be back again when business brings us to Austin."
5,Great service,"The Omni Downtown Austin has a great service staff that made me feel special. It's always the little attention to details that are nice - whether it is remembering your amenities, a personalized letter or just making you feel special at the front desk."
3,This was a pleasure trip to Austin to meet up with a friend.,"Upon arriving we were given keys to elevator and room. Several times we had to replace them as they did not work. Our room had a great view and the beds were comfortable. HowEver,Upon arriving at the hotel we were given keys to work and elevator and room. They had to be replaced several times as they did not work. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. However, the drains in the bathroom backed-up and the carpet under the air/heater vent was damp to the touch. Coffee needs to be improved as Austin is known for such great coffee. In the morning we choose to leave the hotel for out coffee."
1,Management needs to empower staff to fix problems,"Billing inaccuracy, availability of someone other than the desk clerk to speak with, promise to fix the problem and failure to do so. It's a shame, the food service staff, quality of the food and the bar was very good. There are too many hotels of similiar quality close by to stay here again. Very dissapointed."
4,Great downtown option,"Rock solid option in downtown Austin. Excellent location, reasonable rate, good services. If you are looking for Four Seasons pampering, then go down the street. This Omni is for the business and price conscious consumer that wants a near 5 star stay without the $400 price tag."
4,Great Hotel,"We stayed there for 2 nights. It was a great experience. Most of the places to see in Austin are nearby. Some are at walking distance and others are also not that far. Staff there is friendly & helpful. Room was clean, quite & comfortable."
4,Love Austin!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent business/pleasure trip to Austin and our stay at the Omni Downtown. Easily accessible to downtown amenities, and provided a professional meeting place for colleagues. The meals were well prepared and provided variety for all dietary needs. One of my more favorite features of the hotel was the central gathering place in the Atrium ~ whether meeting in small groups, working remotely, or just enjoying a glass of wine, it was a wonderful multi-functional feature of the hotel."
5,Business trip to Austin,I traveled to Austin for a conference at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. It was my first trip to this wonderful city. The location was perfect for walking and exploring this capitol city. Hotel service was terrific. Staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable.
2,Don’t leave early,They punish you for early departure where they charge you for the room and charge you for leaving early. I feel they were not concerned about me leaving early but only what extra fees they could collect.
5,Great hotel stay,The hotel was very nice. It is conveniently located. All staff were extremely courteous. They were very helpful as well. The hotel room was nice and very clean. which is always important. Noise was not an issue at all. Room was quiet.
5,Great place!,"Very comfortable, quiet, clean - I would definitely stay there again. Great beds! Great location right in downtown Austin. Check-in and check-out were really easy. Even with parties going on in town, I didn’t hear it in my room."
4,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel in downtown Austin. Nice bar and restaurant and very close to lots of places to eat or get a drink.They have self and valet parking, the parking lot is very tricky to get into.You have to climb 3 flights of stairs to get to the pool (we were told there is no elevator to the rooftop pool) but once there the views are nice. The rooms on the outside of the building look directly into the office building next door.Alexa at the front desk was very nice and helpful."
4,that's good,"everything is good . Just my car parked in the parking lot was hit, the front desk attendant and the manager gave me a great help. Especially, Ms. Joy, at the front desk. Because my English is not good, she helped me call my insurance company and the police station."
5,Wonderful stay!,First time staying at an Omni Hotel and this was terrific! The price was very reasonabled. The staff in all areas were very cordial and accommodating. Rooms were well decorated and very comfortable. Recommend this hotel very highly and we would stay here again for sure.
5,Enjoyed it,"Nice, clean hotel. Friendly staff. Centrally located with plenty to do within walking distance. Stayed for two nights on a business trip and found the property very accommodating and enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone traveling on business or pleasure."
5,Great Stay for The Running Event,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay during an industry trade show. A very well run hotel. Clean. Updated facility. Friendly and helpful staff. Well trained and knowledgeable about the area. Very good business center. Convenient to all attractions in Austin. Music and restaurants are a short walk.
5,Great weekend.,"Have a son living in Austin. Omni will Be our future place to stay from now in. It is a wonderful place with wonderful people working there. Clean, comfortable, great food, very nice bar. All employees extremely helpful."
5,Omni Austin,The nice simple little things from Housekeeping made all of the difference. From the valet service to the bar and dining areas made the stay fabulous. This was a fabulous facility but it was the people who made all of the difference.
5,A plus for impeccable service,"In our recent trip to Austin’s Downtown Omni we found everything to be as good as it gets. The location is great for live music. The hotel provided great up to date entertainment options for out-of-towners. Staff were professional, friendly and knowledgeable."
5,Thanksgiving,Everyone was so helpful and kind. They really made us feel at home. This is our third time to stay at the Omni and we their service is consistent and rates a 5 star from us. The location and service can't be beat
1,Expensively,"Pay for parking and breakfast and WiFi. Think about the whole trip and price after the room. It said $149, this is before the extras. $30 more parking and $15 more for WiFi and $20 a person for breakfast. And a smelly humid room"
4,Great hotel! Needs some modernization and cheaper parking.,"The staff, common areas, and rooms are incredible! However, there was literally ONE outlet in our room that was accessible to plug phones and things in and it was nowhere close to the bed. Most hotels at least have outlets built into their lamps if the layout does not provide access to the wall ones. I was also disappointed with the expense of parking...."
5,OMNI Downtown. HOOK EM HORNS..,Came in for a UT football game and to visit friends for 3 days.. Spent much time in the hotel and facilities. Location to Town Lake was excellent for walking/ running; enjoyed going to the Capitol and surrounding area. Uber to UT game and cab back. We will be back!
4,Houston,"Nice hotel. Staff is friendly, food good, service good. Bad mattress and loud noise. Stayed there for years and this is the first time it has happen. will stay there again but certain don't want the same mattress or all the noise."
5,Thanksgiving Day Stay,"Excellent experience. Upgraded my check in staff to suite floors due to availability. I did not formally request this upgrade, so the comp was a pleasant surprise. I had booked the room for the Thanksgiving Day Holiday due to visiting family in Austin. Will stay again at the OMNI Downtown Austin. I recommend."
5,Omni - Downtown Austin,"We love the Omni brand and particularly this property. The people are great and accommodating, the food service is excellent and the rooms are awesome. We stay here whenever we have activities and/or plans in the downtown Austin area. Good job!"
4,A Good Place,"The service was good, and I hope it will be better whenever Omni has its new electronic system set up fully. There were some issues whenever my company booked my room where only the first night was payed for even though we requested three nights, leaving me to pay out of pocket at first. However, some phone call reconciled this and I am glad the hotel staff went the extra mile to see it done properly."
3,Not what was expected for high end property,"House keeping non existent. Luke warm food. 30.00 a day to park, 10.00 a day for wifi service. A VERY disappointing week long visit. Normally I would not be this critical, but this the Omni. I would expect this from a lesser caliber hotel."
5,Omni Downtown Austin,I was there on business and was very satisfied with the staff and hotel. The lobby bar was nice and architecture of the building much different than most hotels. It was quite convenient to the convention center and 6th street.
5,First Experience at Omni Hotels,"Great service, clean and luxurious rooms. Food quality was awesome. Check out was a breeze! Just wanted them to wash the new towels before they put them in the bathrooms though. The ""new towel fuzzies"" suck on the way to work."
5,Great business hotel,"I stay at the Omni Austin Downtown at least three times per year. While it is an older hotel, the amenities, like the Club Lounge are great. The staff is very helpful. It is clean and well laid out. Feels like a home away from home. Highly recommend."
5,Conference,Attended a conference at this hotel and the staff was extremely efficient and courteous. The food options at the conference were excellent. One morning we had the breakfast buffet at Ancho's which had excellent choices including a chef making fresh omelets.
4,Pleasant Business Trip,"I was in a business trip to Austin for 3 days and at OMNI Hotel I met great people, great service, great Food,good overall rooms the only minus was the fan in the bathroom did not exist Everything else was very good."
5,"Excellent Staff, Great room, slept great the whole time!","We had a wonderful experience at the Omni. The bar service was great, the food was fabulous, and our room was nice. The beds were very comfortable, and I could not have slept any better than I did during this stay. I would highly recommend this hotel."
2,Too noisy!!! I did not get any sleep!,"I recently stayed at the Omni for one night during a business trip. The hotel seems a bit old, but it's well maintained and very clean. I would highly suggest ordering room service during your stay as everything was delicious and the room service staff was courteous. I don't really understand why the hotel adds a ""tip"" option to the bill when a 20% tip plus a delivery charge are already added to the room service bill - IMHO it's kind of tacky.Before checking-in, I contacted the hotel and requested a quiet room, I also asked for all bedding to be washed (if possible) as I have allergies, when I arrived my room wasn't ready (it was supposed to be a corner room - in their defense I arrived at 2:00 PM - but I had mentioned this in my reservation) so I agreed to stay on an atrium facing room on the 8th floor. The front desk staff seemed a bit bothered, and did not ask me if I was an Omni special guest or discuss any of the benefits of the special guest membership (free internet/complementary coffee). Upon requesting a late check-out (for 2:00 PM), I was told that it would be the half the room rate! I mentioned that at other Omni locations you can pay $50 for late check-out (and it's even available for those specific locations on the website).The room was well decorated and clean, being able to face the atrium was pretty cool, additionally, the fact that there were so many TV channels available (including a turn-down channel) was awesome. BEWARE - the offices facing the atrium can see inside the hotel rooms! The internet connection in my room (which I believe I paid for - and stopped working at exactly midnight) was horrible, I was hardly able to check my work email, I ended up tethering internet from my cellphone. The hotel was extremely noisy, I was awoken by a loud sound which was made by my door throughout the night (and the slamming of other guest doors). Every single time a guest in the vicinity closed their door, the lock on my door would make a LOUD clanking sound. Additionally, in the morning the hotel pipes (well, I assume they were the pipes), made a very loud sound which resembled that of a boat horn. Thankfully, because I was on the 8th floor I wasn't bothered by the noise in the atrium.Speaking of the atrium, I had a drink at the hotel bar, the waitress was horribly slow and had to be flagged down in order to acknowledge myself and a friend (also, the tables were dirty). The echo in the atrium is horrible, I can't imagine how all that noise would sound on a lower level atrium facing rooms.Upon check-out, I felt rushed by the front desk employee who repeatedly told me I would receive my final bill via email (still waiting for the bill - was it too difficult for her to print it out for me?), she also did not tell me the total amount of my stay. The employee also mentioned they would be adding my select guest info to my reservation, but the specific stay is still not showing up in my account (I tried to do this myself, but I think because I booked through a third party website that it is not possible to use your membership benefits) - this is probably related to the Omni special guest program, and not the actual hotel.I read the reviews in detail before booking, but as I'm a loyal Omni customer, I decided to ignore the warnings - I was wrong!!! I should've booked a room at a hotel room where I would've at least gotten a few hours of sleep for my important early morning meeting.As other guests mentioned, there are a bunch of homeless people around the hotel, there's nothing the hotel can really do about it, but be street smart when you're around the area."
5,Visiting Austin,"Wonderful hotel, has it all. perfectly located, beautiful lobby and amenities. I will return, 100%. I usually stay at the JW but the Omni lobby and rooms are just as good. I didn't eat in the hotel, will do so next time."
4,Good stay in Austin,"This hotel is centrally located near 6th St and all nearby restaurants. It is a very good location and would recommend to all visitors. Staff are very helpful and courteous. There is really not much need for a cab to get to places unless you want to stretch out your reach or hit malls, etc."
4,very nice place,"great place, very clean and pleasant, and close to 6th street for good food and music and drinks. Parking is expensive but you can't park in a hotel garage in any downtown area in the US for free that I have ever seen. The lobby bar is very expensive as well but no surprise there either."
2,Football/Parents Weekend,"Our overall experience was definitely less than average. Our toilet in our room wasn’t in working order. Neither was the safe. Three different maintenance people had to come to our room. Even after the toilet was fixed it ran off and on all night. The overall look of the hotel was sub par for the price we paid. The hotel needs a major over haul. I️ will say the dining experience was good. Also, we stayed here two years ago and had a much better experience. Maybe management has changed. For whatever reason the hotel has gone down. We won’t be staying here again anytime soon. Maybe after I️ hear it’s been remodeled."
3,Average,The Omni Hotel is old and needs some updating. The location was good but the hotel is overpriced for what you get. Valet parking couldn’t find my keys and had to wait for them to find them. There are much better options to stay in Austin.
4,Great hotel but not for price,"The hotel was in a great location great service but way overpriced for the quality of the rooms. You can hear every conversation in the next room and in the hallway. However, the bartender makes a mean Bloody Mary!"
3,"Nice location, but needs updating","I was happy to find this location for hotel and Omni brand, but this hotel is very outdated. The only great thing about it was the rooftop pool- very nice, especially at night. The carpet in hallways and rooms was so run down and you could see paths. More electrical plugs need to be at bedstand(s) instead of across room."
5,Wonderful staff!,"I can not say enough about the staff at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown! I have stayed there twice in the past year and have been very impressed both times. We were in one of the Club rooms and greatly appreciated the Happy Hour. Our concierge, Ally, was especially exceptional! She was always smiling, quick to greet us and very personable. It is people like her that make Omni such a special brand. We will definitely be back!"
