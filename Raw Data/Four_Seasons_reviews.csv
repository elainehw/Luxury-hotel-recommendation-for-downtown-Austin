5,"Excellent, but pricey","The service, the rooms, and the common spaces are all excellent. We have an annual work event here and the staff and accommodations are always top notch. Of course everything here is pricey, including the parking that clocks in around $40, maybe $45."
5,Four Seasons - Austin,Great place to stay in Austin. Great facility & very friendly staff. Near restaurants and entertainment area of downtown Austin. It is also great to be so close to the lake and walking path. The spa is first class but pricey as you would expect at Four Seasons. The bar has lots of indoor and outdoor seating so you can enjoy the wonderful Austin weather.
5,Four Seasons Halloween Wedding Stay,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful the staff at the Four Seasons Hotel Austin is. We had a very small intimate wedding on Halloween and everything was just amazing. Beautiful room, wonderful dinner. Mauricette Rodriguez and all the staff helped us put together an unforgettable evening:)"
5,Awesome customer service!,The team at this hotel is awesome. Even when you check in after mid night everyone is smiling and making you feel like you are at home. We have stayed multiple times here and always have a great experience. It is a must stay for a great weekend.
5,"Beautiful, classy & comfortable.","Our 9:30 PM flight from NY to Austin was delayed an hour & we got to the hotel about 2 AM, exhausted. We had called earlier to confirm the reservation & tell them we'd be late. The 2 front desk clerks couldn't find our reservations, seemed inept at using the computer, and check in took about 20 minutes getting us to our room at 2:20 AM,, only to discover they'd given us the wrong keys.Also, maid service was slow & twice I had to ask for the room to be made up in the middle of the afternoon.BUT....Victor Aviles, General manage & Levi, front desk clerk did everything they could to ameliorate the problems & make sure there were no future ones.AND...the rooms are beautiful, they gym is great & the food in the restaurant is outstanding."
5,Another great stay at Four Seasons Austin!!,Great Hotel located in the heart of the city. Everything you would expect from a Four Seasons!! We are live music lovers and have stayed here many times over the years and they have never let us down! We will be back
5,4 Seasons Austin,"Great hotel, I have not stayed at any other hotel in Austin for the past 15 years. 4 Seasons never disappoints... The location is unbeatable, right on the lake and trail. The staff is very attentive and friendly."
5,"Beautiful resort, immaculate grounds & rooms!","I recently stayed here for a business seminar....immaculate rooms, beautiful grounds, great food, extremely friendly & helpful staff! Staff gave us commendations for restaurants, tips for good areas, very helpful."
5,Very appreciative of your friendly genuine staff.,"We enjoyed our stay at Four Seasons Hotel Austin, the convenience of staying at the hotel where our event was being held and the excellent food presentation was very appreciated. The view from our room and the ambiance at the outdoor luncheon with the cold front was welcoming. Look forward to our next visit."
5,Great Experience!,"Wonderful stay. Quality throughout, best rooms, awesome friendly staff. Rooms were very quiet and the bed mattress will guarantee you a great nights sleep. Perfect location to see a great city, Ask Kristi the concierge the best spots to hit, she was 5 for 5 with us."
5,Four Seasons Austin,"Well appointed and located on the River at the heart of downtown within walking distance to Rainey St, 6th Street and the Congress St ""Bat"" Bridge.. Comfortable rooms, great service staff and delicious food. Spend warm days laying pool side and evenings in the lounge."
5,Worth it.,"Had a wonderful stay at Four Seasons Hotel Austin. Great service, hospitality, food, and people. Unlike any hotel I've stayed at before. Conversations are genuine and easy, which helps if you're prone to get homesick. If you have the opportunity, stay here when in Austin!"
4,Nice hotel,"A lovely hotel, in a great spot with refurbed rooms and great service. The pool area is okay, however this is made up for in the service in other areas and the rooms. The service is also second to none in true FS style!"
5,"Outstanding service, friendly staff & amazing hotel","I stayed here for 3 nights in October and i couldn't be happier with my experience, the hotel is gorgeous and the staff are even better. They are beyond welcoming and super friendly, do their absolute best to ensure you have the best experience during your stay."
5,You get what you pay for.,"The only way to get true four star accommodations is to go to a truly four star hotel. The Four Seasons in Austin is a quintessential four star experience. Pristine public spaces and rooms, ultra-friendly service, plush towels, comfy bed, crisp linens, beautiful views, beautiful grounds, spotless carpet, robes and slippers...you get what I'm saying. Personally, for the same money, I'd rather spend fewer nights at a Four Seasons than more nights in a questionable hotel. For me that's money well-spent."
5,Excellent Hotel,"Customer service at this hotel is outstanding. Nice little touches help along the way. People recognizing you and addressing you by name. Staff asking if you need assistance, valet and doorman are nice touches"
5,Austin Texas,"I had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons in Downtown Austin, Texas. Rooms where clean and very comfortable. House keeping was excellent, room was attended to twice a day. The location was great and convenient location for activities downtown."
5,Comfort and convenience,"The Four Seasons Austin is the perfect place if you want luxury, comfort and easy access to the city. Everything is within a short walk or quick ride to all that Austin has to offer. But the thing that will keep bringing you back is the people at the Four Seasons Austin."
5,Great Hotel,"Staff was friendly and welcoming, Sunday brunch was over the top, room (suite) was excellent! Room was cleaned perfectly, amenities and decor modern and impressive. Free coffee, iced coffee, and flavored water, a nice touch. I wish the use of the spa facilities was included in room rate. Thank you for a great experience!"
5,Four Seasons - Austin,"Great place to stay in Austin for business or pleasure. A lot of new hotels in Austin so competition for guests must be intense. Service is top-notch and rooms are comfortable and supplied with slippers, great soaps, lotion, etc. Turn-down service a pleasant surprise, they even left a new tube of toothpaste for me."
5,Loved it!,"We only had a weekend stay, but it was great. Our room had a lovely view of Lady Bird Lake, from the 9th floor. The whole hotel, with the exception of the pool area has been completely refurbished and the new style works well. The pool is being done later this fall.We eat in the hotel both for breakfast, but also for dinner at Ciclo. The Exec Chef came to say hi as we had dinner and then produced a wonderful surprise with a special intermediary course made just for us. I like that man’s style. Nice food.We also made extensive use of the concierge service and Kristi was super helpful.All in all a beautiful, classy hotel in a great location."
1,poor management,apparently this place is some sort of hangout for drug-dealers. I was in the bar waiting on a $20 salad and some gentleman in a suit tried to sell me narcotics. He had a russian accent. I just said no.
5,No Surprise,"The Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, Texas has been one of my favorite places to stay for business or pleasure for over 20 years. I started going there for meetings and seminars after graduating from law school and the quality of the service has been consistently excellent. There is excellent, personalized service from the first step in the door to the moment you drive away. The food service is excellent, the bar is a wonderful place to socialize, and the management is always looking for ways to improve the experience, whether business or pleasure."
5,Nearly perfect,"The hotel is beautiful and very clean. All the staff were friendly and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoyed our stay. My card key failed to work once, and the fr9nt desk staff took care of it in about 30 seconds, We will be coming back."
5,Austin Star Hotel,"I return to the Austin Four Seasons each August to meet with a Distance Learning group. I would not stay at any other hotel. The service is A+ from booking to departure. The hotel has recently been renovated and is a gem. Rooms look out onto Ladybird Lake. Relaxation and pleasure envelope you once you have arrived. Service, dining, spa and all amenities are top notch!"
5,Best in town,"Likely lobby bar from 5pm - 11pm+. Seems to be a bit of a destination still it’s classy and you could feel very comfortable asking a friend for a drink, or meeting a mixed crowd.Location 4/5Hotel food - very good, Service also very good.Rooms are top notch with all the amenities you expect."
5,Best Hotel in Austin,"We always try to find a Four Seasons whenever we travel and when we do, we are never disappointed. It happened again. The check in was simple, the room was great, the view of the lake was delightful, the fitness center is like a brand name gym/club, the spa with massage therapists, and facial techs was wonderful. The restaurant was the best. Try the Chilean Sea Bass when they have it. The GM and their team went out of their way to make us feel valued. This is a keeper."
5,Four Seasons Austin is AMAZING!,"I live in Austin but one of my favorite things to do is staying at different hotels around town. Four Seasons Austin is always my absolute favorite places to staycation! The new hotel remodel is stunning, the friendliness of the staff is unmatched and each time I stay, I can't wait to return! I love you Four Seasons Austin!"
5,My Second Home,"I stay at the hotel 2-3 times per year and it never disappoints. The location is perfect, the new outdoor bar and restaurant is a great addition, the staff is fantastic at making guests feel comfortable and go out of their way to satisfy any request - no matter how random. I would highly recommend booking one of their lakeview balcony rooms -- I always set my alarm to watch the sun rise from the balcony."
5,Beautiful hotel with gorgeous views and amazing staff!,This wasn't my first stay with the Four Seasons in Austin and it won't be my last. Everything is just so well done there. My room was a great size and couldn't be quieter. I slept so well! I also loved being able to watch from my room the bats take off from the bridge every night! Such a treat! Food was great. Service fantastic and the hotel gym is well appointed and rarely had anyone in there whenever I used it. Definitely recommend this hotel!
5,Beautiful and convenient,The four seasons was beautiful and so close to the convention center. The door men greeted me every time with a smile and hello. Check in and check out was swift and painless. The bed was incredibly comfortable and gave me a good nights sleep every night.
5,Excellent Hotel Experience,Most enjoyable accommodations at the 4 Seasons Hotel in Austin. GREAT nights sleep - has to be about the best experience in the comfort of the bed at 4 Seasons - far above all other hotels I have ever stayed at. The level of the hotel room overall was tip top in all respects. Most enjoyable.
5,Thank you for thinking of the female traveler,"As always, Four Seasons delivers a great guest experience, AND they continue to exceed my expectations. As a woman, I really appreciate the low shelf in the shower that allows me to comfortably shave my legs. Sounds silly, but I wish more hotels did this. My firm's training facility added these to their rooms based on a ton of feedback from our female professionals. They also include make-up remover in the jar with the typical cotton products and the blow dryer was of decent quality. Glad to see that Four Seasons considers the needs of the female traveler.Other pleasant surprises also appreciated like providing me with a mouse pad and white noise machine was perfect. My room service breakfast was great, egg white fritatta also very good.All around great experience."
5,My Favorite,"My favorite lodging in Austin. Comfortable room, attentive staff and 5 star food and beverage. The remodeling for the hotel is all complete and beautiful. I don't hesitate to recommend the Four Seasons to my business connections and to friends for a vacation stay. The river location at sunset is outstanding!"
5,Awesome,"There is no other place I'd stay in Austin! The staff is incredible! Friendly, fun, and if there is anything you need, they are right there for you! The hotel is magnificent in itself, excellent location, beautifully landscaped, right on hiking biking trails, but it's the staff that makes this hotel wonderful!"
5,Owen Is AWESOME!,"Owen and Four Seasons (AUSTIN) has the most amazing customer experience we have ever had!! Saved the day numerous times going over and beyond all expectations, across the board, throughout our stay! THANK YOU for every thing!"
5,Four Seasons (AUSTIN),"OUTSTANDING Customer Service professional. Staff is always anticipating the guests every need - friendly, courteous and definitely prioritize our comfort, enjoyment as guests to the Hotel. A staff of superstars!!"
5,Fantastic stay,The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay and of course the condition of the hotel was impeccable. The location of the hotel was a plus too. We will definitely be back. Kristin at the concierge was impeccable with her guidance and recommendations during our stay.
5,Wonderful view of river! Best of all the staff provides true Southern Hospitality- Wonderful staff=wonderful stay!,"All of the staff were so nice! Great place to experience Austin and the lake. Swimming, boating ast the hotel or just do spa!We got a little tired of the restaurant food - needs more choices but good restaurants everywhere in Austin! The hamburgers were notable and don't miss the fingerling potatoes that could go with everything!"
5,Grateful for the excellent service!,"I showed up at the Four Seasons after my site tour at another hotel was a BUST. :((( Rene from events took EXCELLENT care of my and I really appreciated that because I was very discouraged and had no plan B. The rooms are very pretty and newly renovated. The service at the lobby bar was great and our breakfast downstairs was delightful. The downtown location is really fun. The hotel is right on the ""lake"" and we did some paddle boarding and walked along the lake. This Four Seasons did not disappoint and I'm grateful for the high caliber service!"
5,Amazing Four Seasons in Austin!,"Everything from the decor to the customer service is excellent at the Four Seasons in Austin. We only stay there when in Austin. The location is perfect,on the lake, and the views are beautiful, the rooms are pristine, beds are so comfortable, and the whole experience is excellent! Highly recommended!"
5,A wonderful Stay,"Whenever my hubby and I stay at a Four Seasons resort, we know we are gonna get excellent service. And we Did!!! Beds are soft and lovey, room is cold in the July heat, quiet, and the food is always excellent. Everybody is willing to help in any way. The pool was nice and busy - but a great way to cool off. The concierge was so good at helping us with restraunts close by. I can’t say enough about these hotels! We stayed 4 days...Bravo!"
2,Four seasons ATX service sucks,Service sucks at four seasons ATX. We will not be returning to this location. Had over 6 waiters hovering around us with only 5 tables on the back patio restaurant and we had to request service. Took another 10 minutes for somewhere to even bring us water. We left and went to hotel lobby bar. It was terrible
5,Four seasons,"Beautiful hotel, nice rooms great location. Property well maintained,clean. Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful, nice tioletries. Nice view of the water from the rooms. Security thru out the hotel was great."
5,Austin Four Seasons,The newly remodeled Four Seasons in Austin is fresh and modern. I spent 3 days there for a work conference and they made sure I had everything I needed. Service was excellent and the food was better than ever. I can’t wait to go back!!
5,"Wonderful amenities, picturesque views, perfect night sleep!","I don't know why anyone would give this less than 5 stars - I wish I could give it 6!I had a 3-day, 2-night stay here for a work conference and wish I could've stayed forever. The amenities are flawless (the bed to die for), the views of the river unbeatable, and the ambience and service perfection. One of my favorite elements during my stay was that in the early afternoon, they offered a variety of free perks -- one day was an elaborate espresso station (complete with all cream options, flavor shots, etc.). Another day they offered complimentary margaritas with a candy station. The service was phenomenal and everyone who worked here seemed truly happy to assist and provide for their guests. Highly, highly recommend and am already hoping to plan my next stay!"
3,Overpriced,"Very average rooms for price. In addition, the pool area is extremely outdated and not up to luxury status at all. Lobby and staff are very good. The greatest value in this property is the grounds area giving a natural feel to a downtown location."
5,Recent Four Seasons Experience,Fantastic experience at the Four Seasons. Great location with fabulous views. Staff was wonderful and very accommodating. Facility was excellently updated and very clean. I felt welcomed the second I walked through the doors.
5,Gorgeous Lobby!,I was recently in Austin for a friends birthday and we celebrated at The Four Seasons and the staff and lobby bar was perfect for catching up! The fresh flower display in the lobby was amazing and smelled terrific! Kudos to your florist!
3,Outrageous Parking Fees,"My sister and I were meeting for a fun 3 night stay in Austin. I was shocked when I was told the self park rates were $45 per night. Since we had two cars, that was $90 a night for a total of $270. Totally ridiculous especially since their communication with me confirming my stay made no mention of these additional fees. Since these parking rates are so high, I believe they should be disclosed up front. Have to say it ruined my weekend!"
5,Excellent stay at beautiful property!,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Would have loved to stay longer outside of work conference to really enjoy to hotel amenities. The extra touches like kids bathrobe, kids bath essentials and stuffed animal for my son were so appreciated!"
1,Disappointing,"Stayed here for one night on 6/21/19. I hate having to write this review. I love the Four Seasons and have stayed at the Four Seasons in Houston, NYC, Chicago, Orlando, etc. and have always had a wonderful experience. I can't say the same for the Austin location. A few things really stick out about my sub-par experience. Upon arrival we walked over to the reception desk. The women working the desk appeared friendly but I soon realized she was not trained to run the front desk. The best example I can give is when she said ""sorry I'm just not that familiar with reservations"". It all went downhill from there. She kept apologizing- literally apologized 7-8 times. It was overkill and made me uncomfortable. After a brutally long check in experience my boyfriend and I were ready to go upstairs with our luggage. The bellman had placed our luggage on a cart. They pushed the cart into the building from the valet and expected my boyfriend to bring the luggage cart upstairs himself. Weird. Having just had such an uncomfortable experience with the front desk I didn't want to deal with them again so my boyfriend and I just pushed the huge cart upstairs by ourselves.I should mention we had a great experience at the pool. The waitress was friendly and kind- she was wonderful. Brought us water without us asking. Also a great experience with the valet and breakfast service at the restaurant.Later that night we ordered dinner for 2 to our room. No waters were brought up for us. The kids pizza was not good, tasted like it had been made hours before and just recently reheated.No turndown service.Just overall we had a crummy experience. Such a shame especially for paying 600+ dollars for a room per night."
2,Mysteriously missing sunglasses,"I stayed at the Four Seasons in Austin from May 29th - June 2nd for a business trip. The room, the service, the food, the location were all exceptional. However, my expensive Prada sunglasses mysteriously went missing and that is the reason I am giving a poor review. I realized I did not have my sunglasses ten minutes after I left the hotel while in a cab to the airport. I immediately called and told them exactly where I left them but somehow they weren’t there. This is extremely disappointing as I would never expect that from a Four Seasons."
5,Amazing Hotel and service.,"While in Austin for work, I stayed at the Four Seasons Austin and it was everything I have come to expect at this chain. The service was second to none and the rooms were very comfortable, especially the bed. They have remodeled it since I was here last and it is absolutely gorgeous. The convenience to downtown and the conference center is a big plus as well."
3,Not the Four Seasons experience,Staff and property were at the leave of average to poor hotel. Fitness area is old and tired. Half the time knowone answer phone for room service. I would suggest looking at a diffrent Four Seasons hotel or another hotel.
5,Our Place in Austin,"We really liked our recent stay at the Four Seasons, Austin. The location is superb! Not only can you easily walk to many wonderful restaurants and music venues, but Ladybird Lake and its many water activities and trail paths are right at the hotel’s rear doorstep. The hotel charges a princely $45 per night parking fee so if your activities are downtown centric, you may want to eschew having a vehicle. Besides parking cost, another vehicle issue we had was valet wait times. Even though we called ahead by 15 minutes to request our car be retrieved, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes once we arrived at the hotel entrance for its delivery. This happened several times. The young men retrieving the cars were basically running non-stop so the hotel simply requires more valet staffing. That being said, everything else regarding our stay was perfect. The artwork and open lobby are very appealing. The rooms are easily accessed. We were very pleased with our room looking out upon the lake and I much prefer this view to that of the city. The bed is very comfortable and the room itself amply spacious. The toiletries are L’Occitane and good quality. We both loved our bathroom artwork of a horse coming out of the mist. Nice touch! As always, the hotel staff is exceptional and welcoming. We will definitely stay here on our next Austin visit."
5,4 seasons in Austin is a must!,The four seasons is such a beautiful property in the best location. You can explore the Colorado river right out off of the back lawn of the hotel. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. The bar and restaurant are wonderful.
5,Wonderful Long Weekend,Loved our weekend away in Austin. The hotel was impeccable - centrally located but away from the noise of downtown. The concierge helped us put together a memorable weekend and was careful to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Thank you for a great weekend!
5,Favorite hotel in Austin,"I have stayed at the Four seasons twice within the past month and have absolutely loved it both times. The first time I was in town with my mom visiting my sister and the second time was for a couples trip. Would highly recommend this hotel due to the extremely comfortable rooms & very kind / attentive staff. Everyone is super welcoming and helpful. The happy hour is one of the best parts of the hotel, the back patio area is beautiful and we had great $20 bottles of rose. The queso at the bar is also very tasty. For people who like tequila, the margarita cart that comes to your room is a fun touch."
5,Great Property,"Great property within walking distance of 6th Street and other restaurants/bars. Fitness center has been upgraded. It's not huge, but nice for a hotel. Very dog friendly too. I understand they intend to renovate the pool in the near future. That will really transform that area of the property as the pool area is a bit dated."
5,"Classy as always, even better with the renovation!","Always stay at the Four Seasons when I am in Austin. Clearly it has been a while since my last stay. The hotel has been renovated, both public space and guest rooms. Love the new design of the lobby, where they relocated the front desk. The restaurant, bar both look beautiful, fully taking advantage of the river view and privacy of the trees. Rooms are finally updated, a much needed face lift. Great linen and very comfortable bed. Love the design of the room. Wish there is coffee machine in the room or in the lobby. This remains my go-to hotel in Austin despite the new hotels like JW Marriott, Fairmont."
5,Luxury Service!,"Hotel sent text immediately after I on-line checked in to confirm our early arrival, really set our minds at ease! And we were blown away that the valet knew us by name and had our key waiting for us the second we pulled up in our vehicle!!! Plus the pet friendliness was outstanding!!"
4,Casual Week End!,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at the four seasons. We made our reservation via AMEX and received a complimentary upgrade to the lake view room, which was great. The room was very clean and well maintained. Housekeeping did a wonderful job. Bottles of water are a nice touch. Everything was working in order. I would have loved a bathtub with jets. Usually for this price range you can expect to find them. I’m sure they are available in suites though. I was shocked to not find a Nespresso machine?! Or Tea Kettle?! Hopefully they just forgot to put it in our room, that happens. Our check in was professionally done. We had cocktails at the bar, then headed downstairs for happy hours. Amazing food for very low prices! Great deal. We then had dinner at Ciclo, everything was delicious and wonderful. Highlights on Megan who was amazing and wished us a great anniversary. We received amenities both in the room and at the restaurant. This was memorable. Our only deception with this hotel was the spa. The relaxation lounge was extremely tiny with only 4 lounge chairs. Magazines were torn out and used. Even though nobody was present in the lounge, there were coffee cups and wine glasses everywhere. Not a big deal, we moved them ourselves however nobody came to buss for a good hour at least. The spa is really lacking a hot tub and sauna, prices are higher than competitors and yet no wet areas. The only steaming room was in the locker room, very noisy, not so warm and kinda filthy to be honest (again, lots of coffee cups not cleaned for the entire time we were there). I know these are all details but I would never expect that of a four seasons. I love high end hotels for these reasons. The George V in Paris is flawless on cleanliness. There were three staff members talking at the front desk as we left and we were barely acknowledged. I missed the “aggressive hospitality”. I really appreciated the fresh infused water pretty much everywhere in the hotel. Super nice to stay hydrated. Avoid the swimming pool. Looks like a holiday in pool, they badly need to get rid of that orange color and at least put some greek status for the decoration or God knows what. Staff was well trained overall and paid great attention to details, from calling you by your name to making sure you have everything you need. Cheers to PBX who was very knowledgable and did not need to transfer our call. This was impressive. Expect pens. There were no pens in our room. We had to grab the one in front of the elevator. Fitness center was great, breakfast was outstanding as well with our waiter Benjamin! We will definitely come back if the spa is renovated, it will be worth the price. At the moment it may be a little overprice for what it is! Still very enjoyable though!"
5,Always Happy at Austin FS,"The recent renovation perfects what was already an extraordinary hotel! I’ve spent countless days and nights at Austin FS and have always been treated like family there. It’s why I’ve chosen to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, graduations and even had a couple of my children’s weddings there."
5,Best Four Seasons and service!,"Amazing property. Amazing service from bell staff to front desk to room service to the restaurant? The grounds are stunning. The Hotel is immaculate and beautiful with attention to service detail. We were diverted to Austin due to weather. We had never been to Austin so didn’t know what to expect. The Four Seasons Austin was so welcoming. We want to come back and stay at the property again, and we plan to visit Austin just to stay here!"
4,Good hotel but not 5 stars.,"I’ve stayed at the Four Seasons Austin a number of times. The staff is first rate and the service very good. That said the rooms are ordinary (no coffee maker and no ice bucket liner). This time there was a musty smell like wet rags. They send an air freshener to my room and offered to move me but one of the employees confided that all the rooms have the issue due to persistent rain and wet weather. If that’s the case, you’d expect the Four Seasons to have it sorted. Apparently they haven’t. I believe the HVAC is left off when the room is unoccupied. While that may save electricity, I suspect in the long run the hotel will spend more due to mildew issues. Keep the a/c on to keep the mildew at bay.Food was very good. Rooms, as I indicated above, are good, but they’re fairly small for a Four Seasons (and I received an upgrade).I think this location has lost a bit of focus but the staff is first rate so likely an issue with the owners pinching pennies."
4,Outstanding Staff and Otherwise About as Expected,"The highlight of the hotel was the staff. They were exceptionally polite and courteous, as seems to be the difference between nice and very nice hotels. The hotel restaurant, Ciclo, was a pleasant surprise. The meal was excellent and the service was also very good.The hotel facility and the room were adequate. The lake view from the balcony was a bit disappointing as would have been the construction views from the city view rooms (but perhaps we'll try that view on the next visit).It seems that the additional cost of nice hotels primarily delivers exceptional service from their staff - and that is the value comparison left for the guest."
5,Third time a charm,Wife and I just returned from 3 day weekend at the Four Seasons of Austin. Think they have the best location of all the major properties of downtown Austin. We love the location for walking path along the River. They have a terrific patio restaurant we we used for breakfast and dinner. Have an upstairs balcony/bar outside with even better views if sunsets. Don’t forget the “ bats are in season “ for watching at dusk nightly. Many people are in boats and tour ships to view. But we never saw any. Rooms are remodeled. Always clean. Get 4 th floor or higher for river view. Our favorite. Also many restaurants and bars within walking distance. It’s. 4 Star in our book !Bob & Cindy Dallas
5,Perfect,"Perfect in every way. Clean. comfortable. A staff that cared. In a rarity to most hotels. I didn't experience even one slight issue; not a stray piece of dirt or hair, not a missing or non working item from my room, nothing."
3,Pay up for the lake view,"Great location, very nice lobby and grounds, good A- staff. My room was on the small side for a luxury hotel. If you book here, it's worth the ~10% upcharge for a “lake view” room (request floor 4 or higher). Otherwise you'll get a “city view” which overlooks the parking lot and a construction site. Worse yet, there are several tall buildings just a few feet away, and it seemed like “city view “ meant “city views you.” I don't understand why rooms don't have a set of sheer drapes to afford some privacy while letting light in— the only drapes are the heavy ones.Also, the FS seems to host lots of outside events (weddings, benefits, etc) which can pose an inconvenience to hotel guests.There are lots of good hotels in Austin."
5,Well Executed Property and Service,"Nicely finished property from the rooms to the lobby and bar to the outside patio area. Service is excellent from check in to check out, and the property's location is especially nice right on Lady Bird Lake, with nice outside bar areas, pool, hammocks, and fire pits. A resort like setting right on the edge of the business district, best of both worlds. Take time to go to the nearby boathouse and rent a kayak or SUP."
5,Another great stay and newly renovated,"We had another great stay here over Easter weekend. Our first since they completed the renovations. The rooms have been nicely updated and the lobby area, bar and main restaurant have all been completely updated. They also added a large balcony from the lobby bar which is great for outdoor seating and views of Lady Bird Lake and Four Season grounds. My favorite is the back lawn area were the kids can run and play and you can dine casually out here. They are also dog friendly which is a huge plus. Staff was Superior as always. Thank your FS Austin for another wonderful trip!"
1,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE,"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE!!!!!Unfortunately I have to give this place a 1 star rating. Privacy is NOT at the top of their priority list. The reservations manager Laura intruded into my husbands LinkedIn profile to gain personal and sensitive information. When brought this up to management (David) they tried to cover they're tracks by saying she was simply seeking for an email address. Really? You take it upon yourself to just go into your guests personal online pages to look for information without asking? What happened to a telephone call? Leaving a voicemail??? Furthermore our email address is listed in the reservation or we would not have received correspondence regarding confirmation and reservation info etc!!! I have NEVER in the history of staying at this property or any hotel for that matter for employees to investigate or research their guest information online unless they have a reasonable doubt to. We both understand that LinkedIn IS indeed public info. But only for the intent for those in a similar industry to network. Not for the personal enjoyment or pleasure of hotel staff to be looking into because they are being nosey and intrusive!! I tried to make a complaint but got nothing but the run around and excuse after excuse! Hard to get anyone to return a call, email or simply take responsibility for their actions without lying and covering it up! Four Seasons Austin is very sketchy!"
5,Exceptional stay,"Hotel staff provides excellent customer service, upon check in the agent explained where things were, such as resturant, lounge etc. When calliing for in-room service it came promptly, when asking questions the staff was always helpful and greeted me with a smile"
5,Weekend in Austin,"I loved staying at the Four Seasons in Austin! I was there visiting my daughter who is a student at UT. The room, with a view of the lake and the Bat Bridge was awesome! We enjoyed in room dining, time at the bar as well as the restaurant. Top service as you would expect from the Four Seasons."
5,Easter Weekend Getaway,"This Hotel represents the impeccable quality and service the Four Seasons is noted for. When you couple this with a beautiful city such as Austin and the gorgeous property along the Colorado River that the Hotel is on, it is wonderfully relaxing and a joy to stay at!"
1,Horrible stole money,"Didnt apply my deposit and charged my card numerous times without permission. After countless emails very little done to make up for this. Understaffed, no pool attendants, not enough capacity in restaurants to handle guests of the hotel cared more about people that were not guests."
5,your in the wrong place if your not here,Went down for the Easter weekend. The staff along with the hotel is second to none. We have stayed in just about every luxury hotel Austin has to offer. We have found that four seasons stands along. You have everything at your finger tips. Its walking distance to everything or a short urber ride. You have the river view along with a city view. This is a great place to stay as well as a memorable one .
5,Not to be missed!,This review is about the outdoor restaurant. Many friends said its incomparable and they were correct. I’m staying at nearby hotel and walked over for glass of wine and easy dining. Sat outside looking at the river and the atmosphere was very peaceful yet vibes. Excellent wine by the glass and had fantastic fish tacos!I was alone and felt totally comfortable. ILiked it so much that I’ll venture back tonight!
5,The Four Seasons is still the Four Seasons,"It is everything that the name has come to mean. Service is perfection. Food is great, drinks are great. The rooms are a true getaway with comfort and everything that you could possible need. It really holds up the end of the bargain that is expected from The Four Seasons."
5,Great hotel with spectacular service,I love this hotel and so does my dog!! The location on Town Lake with access to biking/walking trails is great as are the service and personal touches. Its just too bad it has gotten to be so expensive. :(
5,"Gorgeous Views, Luxurious Stay","The Four Seasons in Austin is a treat! It's nested next to the lake and is a slice of serenity in downtown Austin. The view of the lake is stunning and while you are in the midst of the bustle of downtown Austin, they've done a fantastic job of making it feel quiet. It's worth upgrading to a lake view to wake up to such a gorgeous view!I would also highly recommend brunch at the Four Seasons. They have a variety of options spanning from sushi to your classic breakfast dishes and the service is unparalleled. Plus, you get $1 mimosas and a fantastic view of the lake!My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding and they did a fantastic job of making the evening feel extra-special."
5,Luxurious Stay,From check in to check out and everything in between my stay at the Four Seasons Austin was wonderful. The concierge was knowledgable and helpful. The grounds were beautifil and the drinks were strong. Waht eslse could one ask for
5,Put Four Seasons on Your List,"The Four Seasons truly provided an ""individual"" feel to my stay and the quality of the experience was fantastic. The rooms were exquisitely appointed and the fitness facility was top-notch. Will absolutely stay again at this property!"
5,quick business trip,"quick 3 night business trip to four seasons austin in february. hotel was redone on the inside but not ultra-modern. outside, especially pool area, needs a major refresh. bed was very comfortable, room was spacious."
1,Definitely not 5-star quality,"Below is an email I sent to Assistant Manger, Sara Thompson, about my experience at the Four Seasons Austin. I did not receive a response. Is this the experience you'd expect from a 5-star hotel? You decide. We found much better quality elsewhere at similar and lower prices.Sara,The following was our experience at the Four Seasons in Austin:1 – When we reserved, we were assured our room would be ready for us in an hour. When we arrived, three hours later, our room was not ready. In fact, we had to wait a half hour while it was prepared.2 – A staff member told us a room had been prepared for us, but that room had given to someone else.3 – When reserving, we explained the importance of a firm mattress. We were assured a special topper would be put on the bed to make it firm. The “topper” turned out to be a thin foam pad which did absolutely nothing. I had to sleep on the floor because the bed was too soft.4 – The following day, the manager at checkout told us the procedure for making a bed firmer was to flip the mattress. The manager said he was surprised we hadn’t been told this and this hadn’t been done for us.5 – The manager at checkout denied our room had been prepared and then given away. Therefore, either the Four Seasons did not live up to its promise of having a room ready for us or someone on the Four Seasons’ staff deliberately lied to us.Your response to our recent experience at the Austin Four Seasons suggests you and the Four Seasons believe it is to some degree acceptable that the Four Seasons failed to deliver on a promise, a guest was put in a position where she had to sleep on the floor, and the manager made it clear that staff was poorly trained and that someone was lying about what had happened. Is this, in any way, consistent with the Four Seasons’ brand? If so, the Four Seasons’ standard for guest care, comfort and satisfaction is well below that of similarly priced hotels and, frankly, of lower price hotels as well. Is this what you and Four Seasons believe and is this how you want to leave it?"
5,EXCELLENT HOSPITALITY IN THE HEART OF TEXAS,"Four Seasons Austin always seems to meet my particular expectations regarding quality, service,comfort and value. Very attentive and unobtrusive staff and management. Beautifully sited on the banks of the Colorado River. Great experience there!"
4,Very nice hotel...but,"Stayed one night meeting up with family. Hotel is very nice, service is first class but honestly for what you’re paying it should have a bigger “wow” factor. Room was nice with view of town lake but for the $750 it really was overpriced. The room is honestly nothing special. It’s comfortable and has a good bed but not $750 nice. The bar is good but again at these prices it should be amazing when it is just merely nice. Location is great and it was a short Uber to everywhere we went. My suggestion is...unless you just have money to burn, stay somewhere else downtown and spend the savings on dinner."
5,Top notch hotel,Came for a college visit for my son. Fabulous hotel. Great location. The lounge area is nice inside and out. Will definitely stay here every time we come to Austin. Nice quiet room with great view of the lake.
5,One of the best Four Seasons Hotels in the world,The lovely four seasons hotel in Austin Texas is hands-down one of the best properties that I have ever visited. I’ve stated five star properties all over the world. What stands out at the Austin four seasons is the amazing service and customer experience. The food as well as the room comfort were sublime. The leadership team as well as all of the staff at the Austin four seasons should be congratulated on their amazing accomplishment!
5,Recent remodel necessary and makes hotel excellent,"Lobby redone, rooms redone bringing up to Four Seasons standards. Right on water so ask for view of it. Pool I presume will be redone next - its small but works. Brand new workout area next to spa. Central location right off trail for walking or running is a bonus."
5,Always awesome,"Our only choice for accommodations while in Austin! Beautiful property located on Lady Bird Lake. Great food, rooms always perfect, walkable to all restaurants and downtown Austin. Staff is second to none!! Friendly and professional always."
5,Right on the water,"I stayed in room 711 with a beautiful view of Lady Bird Lake and the trails around the lake. On a summer evening it would be a perfect place to watch the bats!!This is the fifth hotel that I’ve stayed at in Austin and I have to say the location is perfect. A couple blocks north to SIxth street, a couple of blocks east to Rainy Street but when you look out your window you see the lake and park. I loved it.I only wish they had their own bikes to rent. Being from Canada getting the Uber bikes wasn’t always easy"
5,Texas Living,"I would recommend the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin, to anyone seeking a relaxing stay with excellent accommodations that is centrally located hotel with easy access to all the cultural & flavorful venues the city has to offer."
5,Awesome staff and great hotel.,"Loved being in Austin Texas and the hotel and staff were great! There is a wonderful path right by the hotel and was perfect for a walk or run. Rooms were extremely quiet, and the bed is the best that I have experienced in staying at other 5-star hotels."
5,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,I stayed at the Four Seasons for the SXSW conference and was wowed by the close proximity to all of my conferences and the beautiful room that I was placed in. Highly suggest staying here for any traveler - quiet and comfortable for any stay.
5,Fab!,"This hotel has gone through and is still going through a renovation, although you don't hear or see the renovations.As one would expect the service is exceptional at the Four Seasons. The location is perfect in every way, the staff go above and beyond. Sitting in their restaurant overlooking the lake (partial view) is very serene.The actual room was spotless and had all amenities that you would expect, but no tea/coffee machine, come on now, some of us live on coffee. L'occtaine products in bathroom are really good.Gym is great and spa services are exceptional. One major downside is the access to the outdoor heated salt water pool; you have to walk in your robe from the spa which is on one side to the other side as there are no separate changing facilities such as a pool house to change into your swimsuit. That was a little odd.The bar and restaurant are your typical hotel fare. Bar has some rather loud bands playing, but this is Austin, music capital of the world!Enjoy!"
5,excellent hotel,I would recommend this hotel. Excellent service staff and the room and business conference rooms were excellent. My room was awesome with a view of the river. Service to the room was impeccable. Overall excellent experience.
5,Perfect Hotel,"Gym has brand new equipment kept in perfect condition. Room was quiet, spacious, and comfortable. Food is exceptionally good, and consistently so, at this hotel. I stay here often and this hotel delivers a perfect experience unfailingly."
5,Massive Improvements,"I reviewed this hotel awhile back and called it a Two Seasons. It was very aged at the time, but the service was good.Having now stayed at the property several years in a row, I must give credit where credit is due. The property has done major remodeling, with a gorgeous new lobby and much improved rooms and fitness center. Once again, the service was typical Four Seasons outstanding. Bravo to the team in Austin for all their efforts to improve their hotel!"
5,Great Hotel in Austin on River,"Stayed at the Four Seasons in Austin and had superb experience throughout. Room was spacious and view of river was really nice. Food at breakfast and lunch was delicious with many choices. Service was great throughout hotel, with concierge being one of the best we've had in US. Made great suggestions and took care of getting what we were told would be difficult reservations. Overall an excellent place to stay giving easy access to most places within downtown Austin."
5,The Best Customer Service,"My husband and I have stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel Austin on two occasions. Both times we've stayed in a river view room, which had a beautiful view of the river and the trail where you can take a run or go rent a kayak or paddle boat. The hotel is modern and clean, in a great location, right on the river, close to shopping, restaurants, the capital, and the absolute best customer service we have experienced in a long time. Everyone from the front desk to the valets know your name and are so helpful and warm. There is no pretension or snobbery to be found in this hotel. And if you need anything you can text them and your wish comes true. We won't ever stay anywhere else when we go to Austin!"
5,Very nice hotel with outstanding service,"First time visitors to Austin. We drove down from Dallas after attending a wedding and stayed three nights in a lovely suite facing the street. The room was beautiful and well appointed. Parking staff, front desk and bar employees all had that great 4 seasons training and hospitality. Concierge helped us with some local knowledge and confirmed that we had made good choices for meals/activities. Overnight parking was expensive."
5,Classic for a Reason,"Subdued, maple toned and utterly Texas, the Four Seasons Austin is a robust luxury property right on the river. The lobby cocktail bar is always hopping, and the restaurant downstairs offers a sophisticatedly restrained take on American cuisine with a strong Texas undertow.The rooms continue to the butterscotch palette. The beds are firm, the linens luxurious. The bathrooms provide plenty of room for two people to get ready at the same time, or one person to have an unwinding time before getting ready to face Congress, Sixth Street or the State Capitol.Beyond a state of the art workout room, there is a walking trail along the river that passes by the hotel for a beautiful run/jog/hike. There is also a boathouse within easy reach. AND at sunset, watch the bats fly from under the bridge.As a respite from Austin's go-go-go pace, this is the old school brand of luxury. Many newer properties have been built, but none matches the Four Season for elegance that's as cozy as it is sophisticated."
5,Excellent experience,We had a great experience staying at the Four seasons Austin for their special Valentine's day package. It was definitely a memorable experience and the staff went out of their way to personalize the visit. We will definitely be staying there again.
5,The gold standard of Austin luxury and relaxation,"The property and the people make this Four Seasons a destination of tranquility. We found that the staff at this beautiful hotel, go out of their way to ensure that each guest receives the kind of personalized attention that makes one feel like they are the only client in the hotel."
4,Great Austin wedding,"Very nice place to stay for a wedding in Austin, Texas. The restaurant had great breakfast options. The service in general was very good. The bar late evening was busy with some delay in service. Austin is a growing city and great destination for a weekend."
5,consistently great,I love this hotel. Great service and fresh condition. Everyone at the hotel is helpful and courteous. Great service. Room service is superior. Room service was delivered promptly and the staff was courteous and unobtrusive.
5,Superb stay at Four Seasons,"My husband, son and I recently stayed for three nights at the Four Seasons in Austin. Although we frequently stay in high-end hotels, I cannot say that we’ve ever received better customer service. Absolutely everyone was super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Juan at the front desk was a gem and knew that we would have more comfortable accommodations after the first night and showed us different rooms to meet our needs. We did end up changing rooms and had an incredibly pleasant experience. We will absolutely recommend it to our friends and stay there again, especially if our son attends UT. Thank you for making our stay amazing!"
4,"Four Seasons, Austin","A very nice place. They are service oriented, and very pleasant and helpful. They have amenities I would have used, but it was a short stay and I only found out about them too late to avail myself of them. It pays to research a bit in advance."
5,Outstanding Four Seasons in Austin,From the moment I opened my door I felt at home. The view of the lake was outstanding. Being able to complete my day on the back lawn overlooking the lake with a great glass of wine couldn't be beat! The staff is always friendly and the hotel looks great!
5,Great Time!,"Hotel was family wedding destination. Facility, Food and Staff 5 star!! Easy to walk around downtown. Staff handled all our needs promptly and efficently. Food in Restaurant and Bar was great. View over the lake/river spectacular."
5,Customer Service Done The Right Way!,"Stayed here for two nights during the AWBD conference and it was an excellent experience.Everyone from the bell-men, front-desk, house-keeping, valet-parking and management, were very accommodating and professional.The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and had great pillows, the bath-room water was hot, and the lake-view was great!On Sunday morning, they have a brunch unlike any where i have ever seen!It is a smorgasbord of quality foods, drinks and delights that has something for everybody's taste, and some!Our waiter, Oliver, was on top of his game as he provided top-notch service for our experience!We will be coming back again soon!!!"
5,Perfect,My spouse and I spent 3 nights at this hotel because she had a conference here. The service was outstanding; our room had a beautiful view; and the location was perfect. I would absolutely return to this hotel if I were in Austin again.
5,Everything Done Well,"Visited Austin for a friend’s daughter’s wedding. The wedding was held at the Four Seasons. The hotel excelled in all areas. Beautiful room overlooking the lake - they gave us an upgrade on arrival- VERY comfortable bed, immaculate room, quiet . Every staff member was helpful and polite, Lovely public areas , great location. We did not eat in the restaurant, but had delicious breakfast from room service - pancakes were fabulous- and coffee was located in the lobby area but right by the elevators , so you didn’t have to troop thru the lobby in your morning disheveled look. Excellent bar service and we heard some great music by 3 very young musicians there one night. The wedding was a seated dinner and they pulled that off well. Four delicious courses. The hotel is in a great location. You can’t go wrong here."
5,"Stellar Service, Beautiful Location and Top Notch Hotel","You cannot get better service than that provided by the staff of this Four Seasons hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable and my view of the lake and sunset were amazing. The meeting facilities were well designed and best of all, the banquet and A/V staff made our event run smoothly. I highly recommend this location!"
5,My Stay at the Four Seasons,Excellent hotel! The staff was very attentive and friendly. Sunday brunch was phenomenal. My 4-year-old loved her gifts! The recreation in the area was plentiful. The fitness room was well maintained and clean. We will definitely stay there again.
5,The Good the Bad and the Ugly,"Fastastic hotel in the best location in downtown. Hotel is a classic Four Seasons experience.My review is a bit “tongue in cheek” homage to the Sergio Leone classic Clint Eastwood movie. On the first morning of my stay this past weekend I discovered the painting in the hotel restaurant of “Angel Eyes” I had to pay homage to one of my favoritesThe Good (which really was the entire experience) “for a few dollars more” we upgraded two rooms to the Lake View Suite on the east end of the building (ninth floor) and the City View Suite that was adjoining. Since we were traveling with a nanny it made the rooms work so much better. The remodel has brought the property up to a more modern style yet still maintains that classic Four Seasons timeless style. Loved our suites. My wife said the soaking tub was amazing. Welcome fruit plates, chocolates, and pecans, were delicious. The stuffed animal Bevo lookalike, T-shirt, and small robe for our two year old daughter was a nice touch.Special thanks to Ricardo Perez for wisking us (on time) to our Saturday night Eddie V’s dinner reservation, in the Four Seasons house car.Location is perfect, service fantastic, food was wonderful. Afternoon snacks and cocktails at the bar, and on the patio, were hard to beat. Alas we ate too early for the Sunday brunch at Ciclo because of our departure time. Cannot comment about dinner because we ate off property both nightsNow only because of my title and because if I don’t mention it the review doesn’t help the hotel...The Bad (incredibly minor and did not at all take away from our enjoyable experience and makes me feel a bit nitpicking): The breakfast menu I got a Ciclo had a cover only (which was quickly remedied when I called it to the servers attention) and the server’s assistaant gave the wrong order to us (first someone else’s order entirely. Then my order to my wife and hers to me). Again, totally innocent mistakes and did not affect our enjoyment of the hotel (we loved it).And, finally, (only to complete my title) The Ugly:The construction of the new building, across the street and to the north of the residences, is a slight eyesore (that is totally not the Four Seasons fault and there was no construction noise on the weekend)Great Four Seasons! I can’t imagine a better place to stay in Austin!"
5,Lovely convenient Hotel in heart of Austin,"Large room, clean and comfortable with amenities. Newly renovated and tastefully decorated. Staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant had good menu - great bread! The bar was large and comfortable with nice deck to outdoors where service was available too."
5,visit to Austin,"Hotel is beautiful, staff is extremely helpful, location is great- walking distance to downtown, We had a great couple of day stay in Austin at the Four Season. Can't really go wrong with Four Season."
5,Great Hotel,"Proximity to Walking Trails was great. Hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to everything downtown. Hotel bar was a bit pricey, even at Happy Hour. Hotel was recently remodeled. Crews were still working in some areas."
5,Fantastic family trip,"Favorite hotel,stayed with my family in two rooms. Very good location next to Town Lake. Service, and food was excellent. Every need was met with great Texas hospitality. Rooms were comfortable and well maintained"
5,Great clean hotel with excellent customer service,"Came here over New Year's Eve and was blown away with the hospitality and customer service at the hotel. I stayed here for 3 nights and every step of the way it was fantastic. The room was pristine, the bed so comfortable and the hotel was quiet!! I got worried that it might get loud over New Year's Eve, but it wasn't at all! Also, the STAFF! Wow! They went above and beyond and were overly courteous! Bravo, Four Seasons Austin! This is officially my fav place to stay while in Austin!"
5,Incredible wedding venue,"The Four Seasons Austin is an extraordinary property. From the customer service to the charm and newly renovated property, I would recommend anyone stay there for business and/or pleasure. They went above and beyond to make our wedding weekend magical and treated every one of our guests with the kindest of care."
5,Austin trip,Austin trip for pleasure over New Years holiday. Hotel was exceptional. Service was exemplary. Food and bar service excellent. The music in their bar was better than generally available in music venues. We will stay at another Four Seasons soon
5,OUTSTANDING HOTEL,"The Four Seasons Brand is well represented in Austin, Texas. The rooms, staff, restaurants, lounges and grounds are all exceptional. Their attention to detail is everywhere. In a city of luxury hotels, this is the best of the best."
5,Excellent Stay,Excellent experience all the way around. Even housekeeping personnel went out of their way to greet me every time I encountered them. Concierge personnel were knowledgeable and provided excellent information and recommendations every time I needed them.
5,The BEST hotel,This hotel was over-the-top. Really enjoyed our stay. The bar and food is exceptional. The bed and linens are the best. The staff is helpful and friendly. You will not be disappointed if you choose this hotel.
5,Four Seasons Austin,This was my first time to stay at the Four Seasons Austin and I was completely blow away with the room and overall service. I travel to Austin on a monthly basis and are planning to make the Four Seasons Austin my primary choice of hotel when coming to Austin.
5,Even better after the renovations,"First stayed here a couple of years ago and the recent visit was even better as I very much enjoyed the renovations, particularly the bar area and the outside balcony space which was perfect overlooking the river walk.The room and the service are still top notch and the staff was very friendly. My only regret is that I couldn’t have stayed longer."
5,Hot spot with great spa,Had the best massage I’ve ever had! Just thought my LomiLomi from Hawaii was the best. Can’t wait to return. Love the lobby bar. Great cocktails and people watching! It’s within walking distance of lots of fun sights in Austin.
5,Amazing staff!,"Every single person on staff that I interacted with were friendly, personable and helpful. So impressive to have that level of service and professionalism across the board. The facilities were beautiful and well maintained."
4,Overall very good but standards slipping,"I stay here a few times/year. They renovated recently but the renovation seemed lackluster. Some decor changes but they kept the old (scratched) phones in the rooms and old power stations. Given I’m here fairly often, then provided an amenity — a small box of chocolates. They box has a sticker for a seal — when i opened two of the four chocolates were missing! The box had been pilfered. Also no laundry bag in the room (I looked everywhere), sparse furnishing (must be struggling financially) and they never performed turndown (I was out from 6 pm until 8:30 pm). The rooms now seem more marriott than four seasons. I’d try again on the renovation and upgrade the service (check for missing items and find out who is stealing chocolates!)."
5,Amazing stay!!! Just what you expect from this awesome group.,I stayed at the four seasons in Austin in Nov for 4 nights whilst attending a conference. It was a beautiful hotel which offered an oasis of calm and impeccable service. My room was very special overlooking the water but what made my stay was the attention to detail and the service withs a genuine desire to help. I will definitely stay there every time I visit Austin.
5,Business Travel to Austin,"Beautiful property with courteous and professional staff. Well appointed, clean rooms with all the amenities one would desire. Well located to explore and enjoy Austin. Relaxing views of the river and access to trail complement the newly decorated lobby and restaurant."
5,Excellent property in heart of Austin,"Stayed at the Four Seasons in Austin on business and the experience was excellent from start to finish. All the individuals I encountered from the valet, to the front desk to the wait staff were all top notch and professional.The suite was clean, simply massive and well appointed. The bars we went to were also full of energy and fun.I highly recommend this property if you are visiting Austin!"
5,WONDERFUL PROPERTY & STAFF,"This property and its staff certainly meet all Four Seasons Hotel requirements and standards. Location is simply perfect, beautiful loung and even nicer yards were to enjoy drinks near a fireplace. Will stay at this property again 100%."
3,No bath tub,"Most rooms do not have bath tubs and for the high price and brand this was shocking especially considering I had an executive suite. When inquired, I learned this is the case for most rooms. I was offered to upgrade to a room with a bath tub for double. No thank you."
5,"World Class Hotel in Austin, Texas","Finally there is a luxury hotel with world class service in Austin, Texas. The Four Seasons has been totally upgraded, including the staff. Every aspect is superb. We travel frequently. Most of the time stay in luxury properties and expect a world class experience. The value of the service and accommodations in relation to the cost is an important consideration. The Four Seasons in Austin is worth the cost and I highly recommend it as a luxury hotel. It is ideal for a weekend getaway."
5,Austin's Best,"First class hotel, service, staff and rooms. If the minimum number of required characters is 200 for a review, then I guess I will make up some stuff to augment what I have already said. First class hotel, service, staff and rooms."
5,Lakeview Luxury,The Four Seasons Austin is by far one of the best properties in the portfolio. I have been visiting this property for 15 years and am never disappointed. The rooms are sophisticated and comfortable. The staff is superb. And being situated on the Lake is a plus plus.
2,Disappointing,"The inflated rate for USGP was one thing - but not including $12 ""premium internet"" is petty. The room had a closet that was no more than 12"" wide with a bar next to it that was twice the size! Toilet paper was 1-ply - for a 5 star hotel - that's a crime. Room Service breakfast never showed up until the following day. Check your bill carefully - as they rush you at the desk as there are others in line checking out. We now have to call to sort it out."
5,"❤️ Four Seasons Austin. , Texas. .","The Four Seasons Hotel in Austin is the only place to stay for personal or business. From the the time you pull into the valet are to the time you drive away every aspect of your stay will be perfect. The service and employees are the best part of this Four Seasons. They make you feel so welcomed. It’s the only place to stay in Austin, Texas."
5,Great Property,"Stayed at the property while I was attending a conference in Austin. It was a great experience from the start. Great location, beautiful rooms, comfortable beds. Will happily stay again. The food at the lobby bar is also very nice."
5,"Very nice hotel, superb staff","I was in Austin at the Four Season for business seminars for a couple of days. Without exception every staff person I encountered greeted me with a smile, a ""good morning"" or ""good afternoon."" They always asked if they could help me find something or get something. When I asked for directions they didn't just point and explain, they accompanied me until there was no doubt I'd find what I was looking for. I'm not a guy who looks like he needs a great deal of help. This was just exceptional courtesy."
5,Another great Four Seasons Property,Always stay at Four Seasons if there one in town. Been here before years ago and since then the property has been refurbished. Ultra fast check in as the valet had my keys. Room was spacious and comfortable. Staff were so friendly and my stay was very pleasant. It’s right on the lake walking distance to mostly everything.
5,Welcoming Hotel,"The Four Seasons is well appointed and maintained. Nice lobby vibe with a bar view of the river and hike/bike trail. Convenient location and clean, spacious rooms with comfortable seating and office space. The staff is welcoming and helpful. Attended for a small conference and the event staff and rooms were very nice. I enjoyed the catering meals which was a good touch for a conference given the great food in Austin. The little things are the reason to stay at a Four Seasons and they do take care of guests with refreshments, lovely linens and amenities.The city view is fine, but ask for a water view to enjoy the patio and grounds."
5,Beautifully redone gem,"I have stayed at the Four Seasons in Austin May times over the last decade. It was always the ‘place to stay’ in Austin. However, new high-end hotels have opened in Austin, making the Four Seasons out of date. Like others, I had ‘moved’ on these more modern accommodations.This was my first stay for several years and was delighted by the updated lobby and rooms. The design is modern and very functional. The service was as good as always, polite and attentive. And, of course, the location is beautiful along Lady Bird Lake.I urge everyone who has ‘moved’ to other hotels in Austin to give the Four Seasons another chance. It is back to the high quality standard we took for granted years ago."
5,Friendly staff,"I stayed at the Four Seasons in Austin for three nights and was really satisfied with the overall service, the cleanliness of the rooms and the creative vegetarian food options. Also, the hotel is within walking distance of the city center."
5,Always love this place...,"...lots of happy memories through the years. The enduring message is simple but rare: welcome guests and help themcreate their perfect experience.Example: awake 4:30am to prepare for a meeting. A cheerful ( cheerful at 0’dark thirty??) person sent coffee up in five minutes.Example: special food requests ( no bread, no potaoes, tomatoes instead of fruit?) consider it done.Example: desire for private convo on the lawn with drinks and dinner? Easy peasy snd perfect.For over 20 years this has been my most favorite hotel. Ever."
5,A Piece of Heaven,"in DT Austin. My husband and I stayed 3 nights when we came in for my niece’s HS graduation held at UT. It’s crazy, non-stop graduations. We walked and were back enjoying cocktails on the lawn before my brother & family made it out of the parking structure. That lawn with the chairs and cocktail service is the best! Little squirrels come around begging for the delicious mixed nuts the Bar serves with drinks.May I suggest a Lake View Balcony Room above the 4th fl? (there’s an electrical wire that cuts across the windows 3rd and below.) You can watch the bats at sunset from your room, or from the lawn. I’m smiling thinking, Life is hard, isn’t it?While we there, an ‘older’ couple were getting married in style with a capital S. Beautiful people and attire, so much fun to see. I spoke discreetly to the Front Desk people, they told me their guests had taken approx 1/3 of the guest rooms. 😳 Wow, that’s a big wedding. Sit down dinner, band, dancing, then breakfast. 👍"
5,Beautiful view!,"The service at this hotel was outstanding, personalized and a genuine pleasure! Valet parking was very professional and courteous! We will be staying at this Hotel again and again! The details in the rooms are amazing, the view was incredible!"
5,New lobby bar,Nice atmosphere and great new bar locationGreat cocktails and bar Snacks served up by expert mixologist Paul from DublinOf course with lots of banter to go with it all a nice evening was had by allThe bar food menu is new and delicious
5,Can't go Wrong Here,Overall this was everything that one expects from Four Seasons. The hotel was just lovely. The room wall bright and well appointed and the staff could not have been more helpful. Also the restaurant was excellent.
5,They are a step up,"I have been coming to this hotel a number of times a year for over five years. There are now a number of newer hotels in town that are trying to compete, but at the end of the day, the competition just does not do all the little things that make this hotel special. Other places are no longer offering turn down service or slippers (unless requested). These may seem like little things, but it carries over into the culture of the entire location. They are finishing up a remodel that they have been working on for a few years---the rooms are redone and they are finishing the restaurant, bar and the check-in area. Do not allow this to put you off---the Trio restaurant is up and running in one of the ballroom areas and the food and drinks are as good as ever. I am anxious to see the final redo when I go back again in early November."
5,Familia trip,"I like this hotel a lot. The location, the food, room service and all the personal is great!I’ve stayed in a suite with a city view. And also in a standard room with the river view which is beautiful!Even though now they are remodeling the hotel, we had a pleasant stay. They made us feel at home.I can’t wait to see it finished!"
5,Great hotel,"The staff is always so accommodating, Though they are in the process of renovations I did not feel it affected my stay at all. The location is perfect walking distance to great restaurants and night life."
5,Good location & Good views,"Excellent location very close to downtown Austin.Brilliant Views from the hotel.Strangely all staff were new and do not have a great deal of knowledge including concierge.Breakfast is not that impressive.Good rooms , however currently the hotel is under going through construction and we see builders moving around in the lobby etc . Which I think it’s poor !!Not worth paying $ 1500 a night for all this.The rest the outdoor swimming pool is good and spa is is worth a visit.So mix review and will I stay again is a question I ask my self but hard to decide ..."
5,Top Notch All The Way!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin. The hotel staff are top notch! The property is in a lovely setting on the lake. There are some renovations going on but it is not obtrusive and we found our room to be quiet. The city suite is worth the extra investment one level more than a King room because there is a lot of space and it is well laid out to make the most of it. The fitness center is first class with the latest new equipment and spotlessly clean. It is also easy to walk to all the restaurants, live music and events in downtown Austin from the Four Seasons Hotel."
5,Beautiful Property,Austin Four Seasons is a wonderful oasis in the downtown area. Close to UT and AT&T Center as well as other sites. Easy to walk to shopping and dining; rooms are super comfy. Typical Four Seasons quality.
5,fantastic across the board...no complaints,"fantastic across the board...no complaints. nice rooms, seems to be recently redone. some construction going on in the lobby but it was not intrusive. really thought the staff was top notch. all in all, very impressed and pleased."
5,Impeccable Hospitality!,I can't rave enough about what a wonderful time my family and I had at the Four Seasons Austin! Every detail from knowing about feather pillow allergies to a sweet surprise for my little girl to the top-notch customer service was perfect! We can't wait to come back! MANY thanks for making our stay extra special!
5,Special stay!,"My professional Association has annual meetings scheduled at the Double Tree and its a business trip I look forward to attending. The work is always accomplished and the stay is always excellent. Four star food service for our banquets, business meetings are well serviced and the rooms are immaculate. Always an anticipated trip for business and pampering!"
5,great staff,Customer service at this hotel was best I have ever received! Newly renovated rooms were beautiful and comfortable. Lobby remodel was barely noticeable. Very quiet! Food was quick and delicious. I would highly recommend this hotel.
5,Come for the balconies and the bats 🦇,A perfect location in downtown Austin. Within walking distance of all the main bars and especially Congress bridge - where the largest colony of Mexican free tailed bats live! Every evening on the dot at sunset they fly out for the evening’s feast - and hundreds of tourists flock to see them! (Excuse the pun!) The hotel staff always friendly - rooms spacious and nicely decorated. Love the view of the lake!
5,Sevice that addresses all the needs one might have.,"The most recent event they handled for me was my wedding, inclusive of a fabulous dinner and housing 18 rooms for guests over 4 nights. Everything was handled to perfection in spite of some remodeling that was being addressed."
5,Expectations Exceded,Even though much of the hotel is in current renovations. Our room was great. The service was TOP NOTCH. And the atmosphere was splendid. My small dog was met with acceptance. Even offered us bowls for his water and food. A dog sitter/walker was offered if needed. The concierge was absolutely wonderful. The map was easy to follow to all the places that were suggested.
5,Excellent service and outlook,"The staff are friendly and helpful. They cater to your every need and always willing to help. The view from the rooms were spectacular, overlooking Lady Bird Lake and the Congress Ave Bridge. This was my second stay at this hotel and I would stay again if given the opportunity!"
5,Love it here!,"We had another great stay here in Austin! They had complimentary cookies for our 2 girls and a nice set up of Moscow Mules for my husband and I. Rooms were renovated about a year ago. The main bar, lounge and restaurant are being renovated which we were made aware of prior to arrival. We were on floor 9 and did not hear any construction in our room. They have done a nice job of working around the renovation. Trio has been moved to the ballroom and they still have nice outdoor seating for dinner or drinks. It is just a little closer to the pool area. Pool is fully open and service was excellent. I had a massage which was wonderful! It is always nice to see so many employees we have gotten to know over the 10+ years of visiting."
5,"Great hotel, super friendly staff!!","Stayed for one night at the Four Seasons on a business trip, I checked in around 11pm and the front desk could not have been nicer - the guy was joking around and made me laugh so hard, made my evening. It’s the Four Seasons so the rooms are amazing obviously. The staff here truly makes this hotel stand out!!"
5,4 Seasons Hotel - Austin- still in a class of its own,"Notwithstanding the renovation process, the 4 Seasons Hotel is the top end in luxury accommodations and high end customer service. If you want to know that the room and arrangements are impeccable and will likely exceed your expectations, your only option is the 4 Seasons Hotel. Once renovation is completed, it will be above reproach, as it generally has been in my prior experiences of staying at the 4 Seasons."
2,"wouldn't honor group rate, room filthy, and very condescending.","My wife and I love to travel and we stay in four seasons all over the world. This one is not up to par. I was there for a sports tournament and provided my confirmation email for the group rate. The manager seemed puzzled and said he would look in to it.There were at least 10 others on the same group rate. They were unwilling to extend to me and most of all, the little man on the phone was quite condescending."
5,Home away from home feel,"The hotel carried a quiet, cozy atmosphere and modern, elegant aesthetic. I experienced highest quality customer service and stay. The employees embodied genuine and amiable spirits, which really stood out to me."
5,Fathers Day in Austin,"Excellent stay at what I believe to be the only true luxury hotel in Austin. From check in, in room dining, greeting when leaving and returning to the hotel to check out the service was impeccable. Though the property is currently undergoing a major renovation you don't see or hear any of the actual work being performed. I was there on a weekend which could have played a factor. The Lake View Suite is elegantly appointed and offers serene views of the Colorado River."
5,Fabulous Four Seasons Austin Texas,Just came back from three fabulous days atThe Four Seasons in Austin TexasThe grounds are spectacular and my room on the 9th floor had the most amazing view..From the bellmen to the concierge to Armand the manager and the wonderful pool people everything was just perfect..In room dining was fast and tasty.. the restaurants are child friendly and the entire staff wants each guest to have a happy experience..Can’t wait to go back...
3,Under construction!,"I know it’s the Four Seasons, but the main lobby, restaurant and bar area are under complete construction. As soon as you walk in, there are construction walls throughout the lobby that only allow you to get to the reception desk and the elevators. The staff is great as always and the rooms have been updated, but I can’t get over the price for a room where the amenities are limited. I’m sure when they are finished with the remodel it will be worth it, but for now it’s too expensive."
5,Travellers' favourite,"Clearly not a cheap place to stay but this must be one of my favorite places to stay at. Has been the third time now that I visited for business and hope to once return for leisure. So what it is it that I like about (Four Seasons) Austin; the laidback feeling, both the city (6th Street only few blocks away) and Lady Bird Lake very close by. Basically, the very nicely appointed gardens of the hotel sit directly on the lake/river so enjoy a beer in the garden, take a swim in the pool or go for a run early morning when the heat is not too oppressive yet. The rooms are truly perfect, great bathrooms and beds, all that one could wish for. Also the lobby and restaurant are very nice although under construction as we speak. Hope they don't do the casual, laidback feel of the place any harm. And that they do keep the garden in its original state (as they were cutting down some trees). Anyway, if that's all guaranteed I'll certainly hope to return!!"
5,Best place to host a wedding,The hotel staff made this a wedding to remember! From the champagne welcome to the personalized snack table on our own floor! The staff was very visible to meet any needs you might encounter. They even set-up a dvr in the bridal suite for the bridesmaids to watch personalized movies while getting ready!
3,four seasons below oar,"Under construction and not aware. Pool chair saving policy is idiotic. Way too much money for the embarrassing amenities. Would not stay there again. Value was not there.Rooms were redone, and we were told. However, no one said anything about restaurant and lounge being under construction. A small ballroom was used as the restaurant and lounge. Pathetic. Hopefully, they get this fixed soon."
5,Despite construction still great,Great personal attention . Always enjoy the four seasons . There doing construction in the lobby all summer of 2018 so that may bother some people .. otherwise they never lack customer service .. enjoy
1,WARNING! Massive construction at the hotel right now.,"WARNING! The entire lobby level and the level below are under construction...and yet the hotel is still charging full price for their rooms! I find this obnoxious. When we complained, they didn't do anything about it, which is even more obnoxious, especially considering the ""restaurant"" at the hotel is in the basement in what is normally a conference room (we felt like we were in makeshift poker room at a Holiday Inn i Reno). At these rates there are many better options in the downtown Austin area. I've stayed at this hotel many times and think the rooms are getting tired, too. We generally like the Four Seasons product, but they can do better."
5,Beautiful property,"Always elegant and well-done, the Four Seasons Austin does not disappoint. They are undergoing a major lobby renovation, so noise level is high during weekdays. The staff has accomodated around the project well, and even called me twice before arrival to"
5,Lake View weekend,"We chose room with full lake view. Lovely. Room service exceptional, towels alway adequate. We had breakfast in lovely Trio space, had dinner elsewhere. Before we arrived, emailed concierge who helped us to use weekend visit fully with reservations for tour and restaurant. Good restaurant recommendations."
5,Four Seasons Austin was a wonderful getaway.,"The hotel staff was very attentive to our needs. While the lobby was under construction while we were there, the staff made every effort to ensure that there was no disruption in service. They offered a wonderful free breakfast to make up for any inconvenience (there was really no inconvenience). The room was clean and modern. Recommend Four Seasons to others, be sure to request a water view room. Only complaint was that the drink prices at the bar and at the pool seemed unreasonably high."
5,Beautiful Wedding,"Well I first want to alert anyone reading this to get room reviews. I attended my niece’s wedding and didn’t stay over night but the actual wedding was on the premises as well as the reception. This property is very pretty that’s backed up to lake Travis where you can rent all kinds of water gear. The nuptials were performed outside by nice trees with a view of the lake. It looked whimsical (I have photos). Just a heads up.....if your wedding is during hot weather and longer than 20 minutes, I advise you to go indoors. The sun sets right on the seat area and it was 96 lol. Ok moving on...Cocktail hour: First, you need to know that this hotel offers several cocktail packages and ours was the prestige which includes top notch from Cuervo Gold to Glenlivit 12 yr but also trays of popular drinks were passed like Moscow Mules and flutes of champagne. This part was located in a common area by the reception room doors as well as outside. Very roomy and the staff were attentive. Hors d’oeuvres were plentiful and delicious. We opted for the following: bacon wrapped quail, fried shrimp balls (but made fancier), lollipop lamb chops and mushroom caps stuffed with artichoke. I can’t even think of words that even gets close to the flavor description. I’m a foodie and felt my body leave and go to heaven LOL, let’s leave it at that!Reception time: Fantastic room, decor and food. ( i have pics). Now of course flowers are up to the family as well as color scheme, silverware and plates so I won’t go into that stuff. There were 150 guests who all fit comfortably. The ONLY thing I would of suggested is a bigger dance floor, but who knew that the 10 pc band was so talented that everyone wanted to dance to every song. I’ve never seen so many people dance for so long at a wedding reception,it really was incredible. The dinner chosen for the guests was a spring mix salad with goat cheese, strawberries in a citrusy vinaigrette, Chilean Sea Bass AND filet mignon, this small olive oil potato dressed with whipped potato’s on top and asparagus spears with glazed carrots ( I got pic). Again, no words to describe what this genius of a chef made for us. I will show a pic of the cake but no sense in getting into it since it came from a bakery. OH, not done yet.......besides the two cakes, about an hour after dinner, they put out a make your own sundae area with both vanilla and chocolate ice cream, almond slivers, marshmallows, both caramel and fudge sauces, maraschino cherries, granola and crushed Oreos. I am not going to talk about the band since it’s not hotel related. Valet parking $16In closing, I cannot imagine this hotel having anything but nice rooms. My niece loved her suite but that’s not a room. If you go to Austin and want to treat yourself and splurge a little......so worth it!!!"
5,Always amazing,The Four Seasons in Austin never disappoints! The rooms have been redone and they are beautiful. But the service is really what makes the difference. No detail gets overlooked! All the special treat for kids were much appreciated. And the beds and sound machines makes for the best night sleep. We will be back!
3,World’s Smallest Closet,"The hotel has a great location along the river. Staff is very well trained and I think on the high end of the Four Seasons spectrum. Seriously, the staff quality alone is worth the stay. They just completed an extensive remodel program for the rooms and got a lot right and some misses.Since I was only staying one night, they put me in a room near the elevator and with a connecting door. What was really odd, however, was the size of the closet. At first I actually thought they forgot to include one. I was provided with two hangers and once I hung my jacket and suit pants I didn’t have room for my shirt. They promptly brought me an extra, tho the shirt had to hang off one of the bathroom hooks. Again, fine, but just flat out odd. (See picture below). Given the closet there was no traditional “luggage rack” so my suitcase enjoyed one of the chairs in the room.Another miss was the lack of a “soft close” toilet seat. I think the standard for “four star” hotels should include this feature to avoid the infamous clang noise at night. In any event, again something minor, but surprising choice.Things they did well? Very comfortable bed, nice white noise machine (which I had to run all night due to the elevator noise), very nice seating area of a semicircular couch and table and ample charging areas. The views of the river were worth giving up the closet!Would definitely stay again, but would call in advance to avoid getting a “connecting room” and the closet situation."
5,Elevated experience!,"This hotel must have an excellent employee training program. Every employee we came in contact with was genuinely helpful and friendly. And even though there are many new hotel options in Austin, the Four Seasons is still my favorite. The location is still the best, the renovations are beautiful and restful and there is no other outdoor patio I would rather be on. The attention from employees is an added plus."
5,Modern Luxury,Rooms are newly updated and are lovely. Service and amenities are 5 stars and the restaurant offers a view of the lake. Food is excellent. The property also backs up to a lake which forces you to walk or run or you can visit the newly renovated exceptional spa.
5,Great property on a great location with superb service,Your experience will be perfect\ from arrival till the moment you check-out... The rooms have been recently renovated. The park and river surrounding the property are unparalleled... do I need to say more?
3,weekend trip in Austin,"For what you pay , you can do a lot betterThe rooms are nice, but not spectacular. The review is above average , but you must get a river view and that will probably cost you moreThe pool is average for a 4.5 star hotelTake you money and spend it elsewhere"
4,Nice property but lower level service,"My room was lacking. The phone, sink and TV did not work properly upon check in. Three hours after the call was made, nothing had been done.Manager was very attentive and responsive to my needs after the foul up.Also lovely pool with no attendant or waiter. i had to call for service.Pretty hotel but not up to Four Seasons standards and certainly not for what they charge."
5,Great location,This is a beautiful hotel within walking distance to great Austin downtown restaurants and bars. The grounds are beautiful with a nice walking path along the river. Rooms are on the smaller side compared to other Four Seasons locations that we have stayed in. We had a room facing Cesar Chavez St. and it noisy at times due to construction across the street. Hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. Rooms were serviced promptly each day as soon as we placed the service request on the door.
4,"LOCATION EXCELLENT, NOT THE USUAL FOUR SEASONS YOU EXPECT","Views of the river, and the surrounding grounds are lovely. And the location is right down town. Plenty of great restaurants walking distance. Service first class as usual.The drawback is that the rooms are smaller than you expect for the most expensive rooms ( not suites). Restaurant in hotel is not for fine dining in my opinion. Really is perfect for a businessman traveling."
5,Four night stay in Austin,"Wonderful cordial helpful staff at a beautiful hotel. The concierge, bar staff and restaurant staff were all extremely friendly and helpful! Would stay at the Four Seasons when we visit Austin in the future."
1,Stay at a Motel 6 you’ll get better service....Worst Hotel I’ve ever stayed in.,"From arrival to departure the entire hotel did everything possible to ruin our weekend stay in mid February while we were on our way to MDAnderson in Houston to see a doctor about my wife’s cancer. After waiting 10 minutes for help inloading the I unloaded it my self...as I rolled the cart to the front desk the bellman ran in from outside where he had been chatting with a cab driver the whole time I was doing his job...we had asked for early check-in, 2:00pm, it was now 5pm and we were told it would be another hour...to speed this up..room service deIivered the wrong food twice...when we went to the totally empty restaurant the morning we were leaving we were offered a table behind a post, when we asked for a table with a view we were told it was reserved, no one entered the restaurant the 30 minutes we were there, all tables remained reserved and empty,,,the night before we put up two do NOT DISTURB signs, the maid must have been a blind women because she came bursting thru the door at 8:15pm and woke my wife up....so there are the highlights...stay ata Motel 6 you’ll get better service."
5,Great hotel in a great location,I love this hotel and it's location. Everything is within walking distance or a short drive. The hotel is very clean and updated. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. I used in room dining a few times and they were awesome! The food was great and very prompt delivery. Housekeeping was excellent too.Overall super great experience.
5,Great Reward trip for top 11 consultants from all over the US,"Great job by the team at the Four Seasons in Austin. Although you expect an excellent experience from the Four Seasons, this was above expectations. The food is excellent and the service was fabulous. Walking distance to popular dining and entertainment spots in down town Austin. A premium experience. Take advantage of the work out facility on the ground floor with a great view of the rive and a fabulous green area."
5,Four Seasons Austin,"The Four Seasons in Austin is perfectly located to venues, shopping, restaurants and the Town Lake bike/walk trail. The staff are exceptional as is the property. The restaurants in the hotel are very good and the patio is awesome."
1,Spectacularly overpriced,"For the first time, we spent the weekend at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Austin at a rate of upwards of $715 per night. The property is located on the banks of a large, brown river and has a pretty garden setting. The staff is attentive and the beds are extremely comfortable. The hotel has a pleasant appearance, not spectacular at all. The pool is small, with no exceptional features and there is no life guard on duty. The pool area is hopelessly understaffed, with the two servers running themselves ragged trying to serve everyone and no one to help with the chairs. The rooms and bathrooms are nice but small and unspectacular, there is no coffee maker, it has to be requested, and the light attached to the vanity mirror does not work. The food on the room service menu is unappetizing with practically no healthy options available, except for a salad, which consists almost entirely of greens. The hallways are draughty and for a very high price tag, breakfast is not included. If you order room service, a plain mushroom omelette is almost $30. There are no extra touches or features to remind you you are in a luxury facility. Parking is, of course, $45 a night extra. You get the impression everything is done to cut corners and save money. We will not be returning."
5,Quick Weekend Getaway,"Fantastic location in the heart of the city. Typical Four Seasons service does not disappoint. Came to Austin for a guy’s weekend with my father and chose Four Seasons for location as we did not want a car for the weekend. Entire downtown area is walkable from the hotel. Safe and quiet location as well. Many thanks to our esteemed travel agency, WhataHotel for their help in securing upgrades as well as an awesome welcome amenity!"
5,Outstanding Customer Service,"The Four Seasons hotel in Austin has outstanding customer service throughout the hotel and particularly at the concierge desk which was most helpful with local restaurant picks and business services, the check-in desk which is efficient, and the doorman who are very helpful. The hotel also has extraordinary floral arrangements."
5,Amazing!,All hotels were booked that weekend we got to Austin but we found a room available here. The room was great and spacious with the city view. A couple of blocks away from 6th street. Staff were friendly and helpful.
5,Intelligent Design in any Season,"The hotel sits in an enviable downtown location, adjacent and notably open to the riverside park and trail system that is heavily used by locals and visitors. It is a very urban oasis. Highly recommended!The Four Seasons is a standout for its remarkably well conceived room furnishings. Our Lake View Balcony Room is essentially a long rectangle like many others but the space has been put to remarkably good use. Built in fixtures along one long wall provide excellent storage in drawers and open shelves and an excellent top surface for organizing possessions. USB and standard outlets are in all the right places, and a small round table with a comfortable chair adds practical desk space without taking up much real estate. A curved two person couch (with its own round table and foot stool) softens the corner while lighting appropriate to the likely use of each area is close at hand. The bed is comfortable, with soft, fresh linens and excellent pillows. Bedside tables include drawer and shelf space and a white-noise machine, although we haven’t found the venue to be noisy enough to warrant its use. A neutral palette and attractive materials add texture and a pleasant sense of quiet.As all rooms have been recently renovated one would hope that the freshness and cleanliness of our room is ubiquitous at this property. Another outstanding attribute here is the prompt and thorough housekeeping service.The bathroom, although lacking a bathtub, also contains ample counter space around and beneath the large single sink. There is a generous and functional shower with a corner step built in. All fixtures are clean and in excellent working order. Amenities are by L’Occitane, and a glass end wall doubles as art.The staff is accommodating and gracious here. TRIO restaurant serves excellent food indoors or out, and the bar lounge frequently has live music. The pool is fairly small and can get busy during weekends. We are always delighted to return to this property in Austin where excellence has come to be expected."
4,Great experience,"Four Seasons Austin Texas is an awesome atmosphere. Valet, front desk, room attendant to concierge...all great. Superb location too. Just expensive to stay here. Living in luxury for a few days is a nice treat..."
4,Still a favorite but...,"We have been staying at the hotel when visiting Austin once or twice a year for the last 10 and continue to enjoy the location and overall experience.Having said that ,our last visit surfaced some service issues which we had not encountered previously.Outdoor Service in the beautiful gardens was unavailable until 3 PM so we had to go into the hotel and get drinks ourselves.Similarly,Service at the pool was nonexistent, we had to call from a poolside phone to get service and a chaise lounge next to us stained with bird droppings was left as is all day.The weather was fine all week with temps in the 80s so there was no excuse for either of these service issues.We hope they do not reflect staffing cuts or other efforts to manage costs at the expense of the overall guest experience."
5,Four Seasons Reputation Maintained!,"Stayed her for a conference and I was very pleased with the hotel. Location is ideal and right in the heart of downtown, yet set off from street enough that you feel secluded. From check in to check out the hotel staff were amazing and attentive. Great recommendations for restaurant and sites to see. Housekeeping was wonderful, they even replaced my nearly empty tube of toothpaste with a new one. Nice touch! Workout room was spacious with plenty of machines and weights to choose from. Back patio and pool area is nice and secluded from the path next to the river. Room was well appointed with an extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Amazing technology points with power plus and usb connections both at the table and both bedside nightstands. Would absolutely make this my home base on my next visit."
5,Stay Here!!,Very convenient to walk everywhere and beautiful view of Lady Bird Lake. Also great viewing here for the Congress Ave. bats. Room was divine and always superb service and friendliness from the staff. Loved the man doing the flower arrangements in the lobby. What a gem!!
4,My favorite local destination needs help,"I love this property, it brings together land, water, the best food and eclectic shopping. But this visit was a little disappointing with customer service, I hope that it was a busy weekend, hence the distracted staff. Trio was understaffed, the front desk seemed really"
5,Luxurious Leader,This was the place we got married years ago and today still very elegant and luxurious. We were here today for a SXSW 2018 event and greeted as we entered the lobby. Apparently they are slowly renovating this hotel to keep up with the newer upper scale hotels in downtown Austin. If you did not know you would not even notice it was going on. One of the major upcoming is redoing the pool area.After talking I headed to my event which was located outside sort like the backyard of the hotel. The landscaping was perfect and awesome view of Lady Bird Lake. The staff here was very professional and made me feel welcomed.This hotel during the holidays has a yearly tradition of creating themed gingerbread houses. And even had special events for every holiday in the year.As we left the event the hotel concierge thanked us as we headed out. This is definitely in the best top three hotels in Austin.
5,ITs been too long !,Just stayed at the Four Seasons last week on our way south. We usually stay at Omni Barton Creek but this time we came back to the Austin Four seasons. Wow ! This has been updated to First class. We had a spectacular room on the 4 floor facing the river and town. IT was Terrific. The room goodies were sweet. IT was just a wonderful experience ssince our last visit 3 years ago.
5,AUSTIN LOOKS BEAUTIFUL FROM YOUR LAKE VIEW ROOM,"The service and accommodating staff make this a respite during your time in Austin. Concierge made everything happen for me easily as I needed flowers ordered and delivered to a client and also needed assured car service to the airport at 4AM, along with nail glue, overnighting packages and a good cup of coffee to set me on my way - all within about 16 hours total. Great job with professionalism. Thought the cleanliness and upkeep of common areas fell short (lobby bar, lobby restroom) and needs improvement but is easily rectified with minor attention. Wish I had more time there."
4,"Great customer service, but VERY pricey.","Was here for a corporate event and the staff was extremely polite, helpful and accomodating. The property was lovely for our event and the rooms were very clean. The blackout curtains were appreciated. Full disclosure: Had the company not been picking up the tab, I would not be staying here, as it is VERY expensive."
5,All Good for Us,"Visied the hotel as part of a private conference and found everything was to a high standard; my colleagues all agreed. Set by a nice lake and with surprisingly pleasant walks, hotel is also within an easy stroll of most of downtown Austin - a really good location. All the staff I met were pleasant and helpful and the cleaners did a really good job in the room."
4,A nice hotel in awesome Austin,Three nights in this hotel in a great location. Easy walk to much of the Austin downtown and club scene. Walking to the University of Texas might be a bit of a hike. Also one can easily rent a bike to peddle around Lady Bird Lake. Plus you can view the bats flying at dusk right in front of the property.
3,Some serious flaws in an otherwise great property,"The recent interior renovations are “A” quality but the bones of the hotel are “C+“. The bathrooms are TINY!Also check your bill! Booked through Amex and did not automatically get the free breakfast or dining credit - had to ask/have my bill corrected. Also the spa incorrectly transferred the bill, so had to correct that too. Note that valet is $45 a night - better off using Uber while in town."
3,Nice but not friendly or courteous,"Busy weekend with a number of groups having parties, but in my estimation and experience, that is not a valid reason for not having courteous, helpful people on staff. The hotel is expensive for Austin and we checked out early and stayed at a Hilton which was half the price and seemed to be happy that we were there."
5,Four Seasons in Austin is top rate,"It comes as no surprise that the Four Seasons in Austin continues to provide warm, comfortable, luxury accommodations for its guest. That is the Four Seasons brand and it is alive and well at this location."
5,The best in Austin,"Once again, the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin created another typically excellent experience for me. The service was friendly and excellent and the facility (I was there for a meeting) was everything and more that have come to expect. The staff was knowledgeable and the event came off without a hitch."
1,A beautiful Fairmont hotel opened next door to the Four Seasons; I recommend you stay there.,"A beautiful Fairmont hotel opened next door to the Four Seasons. Stay there, at the Fairmont. Or any other hotel really. The service and staff at the Four Seasons in Austin were as bad as can be imagined, only worse."
5,"Best Four Seasons Property, Hands Down","I have long held the Austin FS property as my standard when traveling. From service to cleanliness, they never miss a beat. The staff is incredible and always helpful. I've stayed at several other FS hotels along with other 5-star places, but Austin's FS is far and away my favorite."
4,Great spot for downtown concerts,"Close to trail on lake, great access to downtown, went to ACL live - great to be able to walk to the venue and easily walk to Rainey and great restaurants. Only complaint is that this place turns into a zoo at 5 pm in the lobby bar area, and ordered a Martini that tabbed out at $22. I get its the Four Seasons - but $22 for a cocktail?"
5,Wedding night treat,"Wonderful place to stay for our wedding night. Staff was wonderful (very kind in congratulating us), city-view suitesuite was amazing, and in-room breakfast was delicious, and taken care of perfectly."
5,Nicest Place in Austin,"Great location: easy access to all the great dining and nightlife downtown, and walk out the backdoor to get on the trails at Town Lake. Fantastic food at Trio and at the lobby bar/lounge, also love the live music in the evenings at the lounge. Very comfortable, clean, luxurious rooms. Warm and inviting staff in every position. Can't wait to go back!"
5,great service & clean property,"we stayed for 4 days 3 nights in march 2018. the staff were friendly and helpful; they somehow remembered my name even though we've never met, which was impressive. the property was clean but looked tiny compared to the surrounding skyscrapers. the swimming pool was a let down...not very big; we jumped in one evening around 5:45PM and the water was cooooold which didn't help because that day was particularly windy and gusty. it's located within one block from congress bridge where the bats are located, which was convenient. overall location was nice but parking was not cheap $45/night and hotel was not cheap either. the mattress was incredibly comfortable, not lumpy like a lot of other hotels"
5,Four Seasons,"My favorite Austin hotel. Great service and facility. Austin traffic is worse than most anyplace I've ever been outside of Chicago and LA. And downtown traffic is the worst of all. But, once you arrive at the Four Seasons downtown, its easy to unwind out back among the oak trees, along the river, in the bar or in the room. Well worth fighting even Austin traffic for this hotel."
5,Good visit,"We can enjoy not only the guest room, but also watching bat from the room window without going out. What a nice location for tourist! This hoteo locates very quiet environment and also very convenient for running and dinning or business."
5,We moved from the JW and couldn’t be happier,"Guitars available at the desk, Nicholas the Lounge manager made us feel at home every day and always went the extra mile. Angela, and the rest of the team were always happy and attentive. Modifying food and drink to meet our needs. The music was great every night. We will be back next year! Appreciatively, Neil"
4,Great location on Lady Bird lake,"Service is over the top. Lobby, bar and Restaurant great too. View of lake from balcony rooms is nice. However, the rooms are more akin to a HYATT than what you would expect from a Four Seasons. The rooms are way overpriced for their small size, dated very small bathrooms- without a tub."
5,Four Seasons Fantastic!,Stopped by the lounge a couple nights while I was in town for the interactive portion of sxsw. Manager nick and his lovely staff took great care of me each time. Service was prompt and beverage selection was excellent. I am always weary when going to a hotel bar I'm when I'm not a guest of the hotel. But they made me feel like I belonged. Thank you!
5,Great location and amazing service,"Spent 2 nights here during Spring Break with the family. Great location as we were able to walk to SoCo district and also shops and restaurants on the North Side of town. The hotel staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, rooms were updated and very clean, and the views were amazing. Highly recommend staying here if visiting Austin!"
4,Incredible Staff,"The hotel is great, very clean and nice as expected. I will say it is not the nicest Four Seasons I have ever been to, but still a luxury hotel. The pool and pool area is a bit small however the back lawn is so beautiful and relaxing. Its the perfect place for a late night wine session.The staff on the other hand, is absolutely INCREDIBLE. The nicest people who are just so accommodating, everyone from the bellboy to the banquet staff. I have never stayed anywhere that had better staff than at the Four Seasons Austin.TRIO, the hotel restaurant, is also delicious. Very tasty lunches and dinners."
5,Fabulous Hotel,"We held a very high-level customer meeting at the Four Seasons and everything was great. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel special and to make sure our meeting went well. Liz, the Concierge, was fantastic. Anything I needed, Liz took care of it. The guest rooms were clean and comfortable. The food was awesome. We will definitely go back to the Four Seasons."
1,The worst Four Seasons.,"We are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin Tx. The service has been miserable. No turn down service on Sunday night; the staff left the room a mess. No turn down on Monday either. The staff took two days to address a broken and leaking air conditioner in our room. Leaking, as in a puddle of water in the room. I finally had to call the North American headquarters before any action was taken to rectify the situation. Only then were we moved to a different room with a working A/C. I've received many phone calls over the last 24 hours apologizing for the lapses in services. No actual plans for making things right, but everyone assures me that they are very really truly sorry for leaving us in a hot humid damp room for two days. I guess they think wasting my time with endless phone calls enhances my vacation. The staff here seems incapable to taking care of even simple problems. And please stop giving my daughter animal crackers! That doesn't make up for anything. Bunch of slack-jawed, inattentive clowns."
5,Conspicuous Consumption,"This is a luxury hotel with beautiful rooms, beautiful views, beautiful service, beautiful food and beautiful people at a breathtaking price. This facility is better shared with one you love but I was here on business so I didn’t lounge around in the plush robes provided. I didn’t have a massage or get room service while enjoying the 60” flat screen in my room. I didn’t swim in the sparkling pool, use the workout equipment or do some paddle boating on the river. I didn’t have time to take advantage of it’s location downtown. I hope you get to when you go. Just don’t forget your gold card."
4,Staff has your back,"The Four Seasons's location is sweet -- if you're not driving. Major construction going on across the street compounds the usual gridlock.My standard room was on the fifth floor and overlooked Ladybird Lake/Colorado River. Utility lines, however, put a quick end to thoughts of taking photos at sunset. Windows have a very necessary shade that cuts blinding glare nicely. Can block all light out if you wish.The hotel's service was great. The friendly staff went above and beyond to get me newspapers each of the two mornings I was there. Apparently I accidentally left the room's phone line ""open"" and I guess they couldn't reach me to deliver the backup wake-up call I had requested so they sent someone up to rap on the door.I did enjoy the ""ocean sounds"" from the white-noise gadget they put near the bed.On the second night, I apparently missed the turn-down service and didn't get the bucket of ice. Not 10 minutes later a friendly young woman knocked and handed me a pail of ice. ""Cool"" move!Not so hot was someone's decision to put the hot/cold faucet handle on the far side of the large walk-in shower, behind the glass wall making it impossible to start/adjust from outside. There's a high likelihood you'll be doused with a blast of cold water when you start your shower.I had an early flight so had breakfast in the room. My decision to try something beyond the usual ""all american"" breakfast since this was Austin, where good Tex Mex and BBQ are readily available, backfired. The dine-in menu's ""Enchildas de Migras"" fell below Austin standards, being rather ""flat"" (taste-wise). The breakfast plus a small pot of coffee came to about $45 once service charge and faxes are included. (the menu didn't have prices.)If you like your coffee strong, you may like Four Seasons' but I found the stuff they filled the small pot with bitter. (There's no in-room coffee maker but java is offered down in the lobby in the morning) The room has minibar and snacks.The WiFi for the hotel guests was easy to log on to; maybe too easy as there were no passwords required. The standard, free Internet was good for 2.09 Mbps downloading and 1.94 Mbps uploading when I ran it through SpeedTest. For an extra charge, the hotel offers a faster connection."
3,its nice but not as good as other four seasons,Its a nice hotel but not particularly special. Great Location and staff is generally tries to be helpful but lacks some knowledge. Its expensive but the price doesn't match the quality and service level you would expect for the money you pay.
1,bad,management very very poor!!! did not get to our suite until after 5 pm .. check in was at 3 pm..we had our reservations for over one month.. will never stay at a four season hotel again. Paid over 900.00 for this sorry room
5,Beautiful hotel,"Perfect hotel for weekend retreat ... the staff is extremely friendly and able to really go out of their way to provide the highest service. State of the art fitness center with brand new machines nice spa area and steam room. Highly recommend going for a drink at the beautiful bar overlooking river before going to restaurant. Rooms are normal size but great equipment provided: large smart TV, wonderful plush bed."
5,Amazing Service Sets it Apart,"We stayed two nights and it was beautiful. Cozy and comfortable room with giant TV and balcony. Be sure to get a water view. City view is not great. The service of each person that works here is what made it outstanding. Liz and Tony at the concierge desk went above and beyond to tend to our every need. We wanted to rent a car...they keep them right on the property and five minutes later we had one. We wanted a private tour of Texas...they asked what time and set it up for us. $90 an hour minimum 2 hours. Ask for Luis. He did a great job and was really lovely. The lobby was beautiful and smelled heavenly. It had a rustic vibe with fireplaces, stone, leathers, etc. a very warm elegant feel. The only negatives were no coffee in the room, hair dryer wasn’t great, and no personal fridge, microwave, or ice machine. They did fill our ice bucket every evening during turn down service, however. Speaking of turndown service, the housekeeping was perhaps the best I’ve experienced anywhere. We had a lovely stay and were sad to leave this beautiful place. It is situated in a great location where you can walk to many places."
5,Great hotel and location for business meetings,"Located near the convention center, the hotel is in the heart of downtown Austin. Of course, you get the five-star treatment of the Four Seasons, the rooms are nicely decorated and the screen on the room television is much larger than a typical hotel. Lobby area is a great place to see friends and business acquaintances as a meeting spot. There are plenty of servers to make sure that you have a drink in the lobby."
5,Great Experience!,"Met up with some friends at the lounge. Great ambiance, service and attention to detail! Manager Nick went out of his way to help us get situated. I had a last word and my colleague went with Nicks beer recommendation and both were great! I can’t wait to come back"
5,Great stay,"The staff go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is great. From the moment you pull in to when you're checking out, every detail is taken care of. The restaurant TRIO serves one of the best crab cakes and their Sunday buffet is the best in town."
5,Just like home,"There are plenty of lovely places to stay in Austin. The Four Seasons Hotel is my go to spot. The staff are attentive, the rooms are clean and very comfortable and any food and beverage is awesome.They always exceed my expectations."
5,January 2018 stay,"Service is amazing here. Staff goes above and beyond. Location was convenient and nice to be able to walk on the lake behind hotel. If you asked staff a question on where something was located, instead of telling you, they would escort you to wherever you needed to get inside the hotel."
5,Best place to stay in ATX,Amazing stay. The level of service and quality is unmatched by any other hotel in the area. Room was fantastic and modern. Super comfy bed with turn down service! Great location for access to the convention center!
5,Austin Trip,Outstanding service. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Beautiful facility. Can't wait to stay at another Four Seasons. The experience was so good I almost forgot I was working instead of being on a luxurious vacation.
5,Austin Visit,Wonderful experience at the Four Seasons Austin. Staff was most helpful and recommend places to visit. Spent an afternoon at the LBJ Presidential Library. Very interesting.Evening entertainment in the hotel lounge was wonderful!
5,Excellent Hotel in Good Location,The Four Seasons in Austin was a beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff was friendly and helpful and the property was luxurious without being ostentatious. Within walking distance of the downtown music scene and located on the river there's something for everyone close by.
5,Business Trip,"Beautiful hotel on the river. Some rooms have a great river view. Hotel bar is nice and has windows opened towards the river. Outside there is lots td of seating with views of the river and paths for running and walking . The Hotel room is gorgeous, spacious and very clean ."
3,"Pluses and minuses, lousy internet","I don't think this 4 seasons is worth the money. First the pluses - generally excellent, friendly staff. Rooms have been renovated, though not all that well. Excellent bed, and excellent blackout curtains. (Bed is the highlight I'd say, as good as my bed at home almost)Problems - main issue is for the price point. First, the internet sucks. This annoys me quite a bit at this price point. You can pay extra for better internet, but they could at least rise to the level of the holiday inn for what one pays.Second, insufficient power outlets. This is crazy. 2 people = 2 phones and 2 computers. So why 3 outlets available on the desk?!!! Prepare to unplug something or go behind the sofa.Hotel is surprisingly noisy. Bring earplugs. Lots of ice bucket noises, (wtf?!) elevator even though it's no where nearby, hall noises etc. etc. I think issue is that its an 80s building that is getting tired.Very little closet space. Very little drawer space. Barn door to bathroom is cute and all, but downright annoying - those things are for looks not use.All in, I'll explore the JW Marriott or some such next time."
5,Best Luxury Hotel in Austin,"The Four Seasons brand is solidly represented here. From the minute you check in, throughout your whole stay, to the second you are packing your bags, they are there as much as you need them...or don't. The newly remodeled rooms are gorgeous, and the bathrooms are perfectly suited for travers who need some down time. I cannot say enough how much I appreciate theFour Seasons Austin staff and their attention to detail."
5,Excellent Service and Amenities,It is always clean and fresh and the staff is always friendly. The bar is one of my favorites in downtown Austin with live music. The running trail is right out the doors and the updated workout equipment complete with a TRX system was a nice treat.
5,st gabriels gala night,"Outstanding facility and service. Worth the stay, The staff was very accommodating and the facilities sweep you away from the hustle and bustle of Austin. Highly recommend this hotel not only to travelers but also for a weekend getaway for locals to embrace all the city has to offer."
5,Love this place,"Everytime and every location the Four Seasons Rocks. From the staff to the amenities, the hotel in Austin is the best value for a high end experience. We have tried a couple of others, and none of them can compare."
5,Best hotel in Austin,This hotel has a culture of excellence and it shows from the moment you drive up into the parking lot. The entire staff is attentive and really goes the extra mile in every service from the doorman to the housekeeping. I highly recommend a stay both for business or for pleasure. The hotel grounds are also stunning and in a perfect location in the heart of Downtown Austin. You won't be disappointed by choosing this hotel on your stay!
4,High End Hotel,Amazing spot to view the Bats that literally flock to Austin From March - October that emerge from a narrow deep crevice underside the Ann W Richards Congress Bridge .... atmosphere of a High StandardThe eating dining Area very adequate & up marketCuisine & drinking options of a high Standard
5,"Four Seasons Austin, TX","I was blown away by the way I was treated at the Four Seasons Austin, TX. The amenities were fabulous. The area is beautiful with so much to offer guests of the Four Seasons in Austin, TX. Location is wonderful also."
5,Love the Four Seasons Austin,"Well, what can I say, for Business travel to Austin this is an awesome hotel.. I like it more than the FS in Palo Alto and more than any other US hotel I've stayed at. They have a great bar, great food, awesome gym and nice staff. I've stayed 8-9 times now and love it."
5,Amazing Staff and Beautiful grounds,The immediate access to walk the lake was heaven. Everyone on the staff including the restaurant staff knew our names. Soooo nice. Our dogs were with us and the immediate access to grass was greatly appreciated. The staff loved on the dogs too!
5,TRIO restaurant is GRAND,"TRIO restaurant is one of the finest of fine dining in downtown Austin.Staff is top notch and the menu is full of triple delights.Take a limo, taxi, or uber and go have a wonderful meal.You will love it. Evening dinner, or weekend brunch, you will love it."
5,Amazing staycation,"Service, experience, simply the best at the Four Seasons in Austin. From our room with lake view balcony to every detail of champagne, gift bag from spa, amazing food and service at the lounge, it was just perfect!"
5,Wonderful way to spend Christmas with puppies,"This is our second year to spend Christmas at the Four Seasons in Austin. We took our two small dogs with us & had a very relaxing time. The hotel is very pet friendly & is close to several restaurants in downtown Austin. The hotel's outdoor space is very nice & is a great place to walk dogs & get a beautiful view of Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake). The thing that sets the hotel above others is the service. The staff are(is?) all very professional, but very friendly. We had dinner Christmas night at the Trio restaurant t the hotel & ate on the patio since we had our dogs with us. John, our server, was very gracious in providing us with outdoor heaters that kept us comfortably warm in cold temperatures outside."
5,An oasis of calm and comfort,"This Four Seasons Hotel is a worthy member of the chain. The staff was warm and welcoming from the moment we set foot inside. The rooms are up to date and well-appointed, modern without feeling sterile. The restaurants had an interesting menu, the lobby bar was a great place to have a snack and a beverage, and the location is excellent."
5,Solid,"Great hotel like almost all Four Seasons. Really good food in Trio, super friendly staff throughout the hotel. Excellent location. Hot water is dangerously hot and it would be nice if there was coffee and tea in the room. Otherwise perfect."
5,Could not do enough for us!! Service with a Smile..,"After the initial mix up with the type of room we had booked, and the anxiety this caused us, everything was organised as we had wanted for the next day.The manager was amazing. They did everything they could to make us feel welcome.Business meetings with our clients went very well and we must say we were more than pleased with the efforts of the management and staff.On our next visit, we shall certainly stay at the Four Seasons!Thank you everyone!!"
5,Thanksgiving Buffet,"We were out of town this year for the Thanksgiving holiday to enjoy some TX Football! So we didnt have the comfort of our family traditional meal. We splurged for Four Seasons buffet -- and it did NOT disappoint!The service, food and atmosphere was simply amazing!Loved it and worth every penny!"
5,Father and daughter trip,"My daughter and I traveled to Austin for a trip in December for fun, where I used to live. Austin is a great destination with excellent restaurants, friendly people and a cool vibe. The Four Seasons is in a great location in downtown Austin along side Town Lake . It is the premium place to stay when visiting"
5,Always the Best!,"We had an amazing time staying at the Four Seasons Austin for a friends wedding weekend. The lobby was nicely decorated for Christmas and the newly renovated rooms were great. The beds were super comfortable, and the room service was timely as well!"
5,"Beautiful suite, service and view!","We splurged on a lakeside suite this time and it did not disappoint! Beautifully remodeled with a clean, soft contemporary feel to it. Everything was well appointed, laid out and comfortable and the view was spectacular. So glad the Four Seasons finally paid attention to their Austin gem! The staff was outstanding and the location within steps of Town Lake cannot be beat."
5,Great location,"The hotel is in a perfect spot next to Lady Bird Lake. The views are nice from the south facing rooms. The location is perfect in downtown Austin. The facilities are very nice. The staff is great. The rooms are average sized, very clean. It was a great stay."
5,everything you expect from 4 seasons,"clean, friendly, accommodating,great location and a great bar. It was great seeing the lobby decorated for christmas and also seeing the teddy bear tea with all the kids and parents. The location is great for a nice walk to Congress street and also close to all the downtown has to offer. Even 6th street, if you want to go there!"
5,GREAT EXCEPT THE LOCATION,"This is a first class property with outstanding service and rooms! In almost every respect it is a flawless hotel. My only beef is the location. It's actually great for runners like myself since you are right there on the shaded running trail along Town Lake (for us older Austinites) now known as Lady Bird Lake---and rightly so. If you want to be in walking distance to sixth street, to a UT sports event, or a one of the growing great places to eat in downtown, this is where it gets tricky. Just not ideal and at times not safe. I'm 6-3 190lbs and I've my moments to being timid to walk after dark. Too many shady characters hanging out and just too far and dark to walk to sixth street. The problem is that over time parking has gotten really difficult. Fine for Uber....I get it...but there are growing options in actual downtown where you don't have to use a car to get around. It used to be at one time this was the only luxury place to stay. If you want to experience the city by walking I would avoid Four Seasons....If you want to be pampered in luxury and don't care about walking you can't staff at a better property. One last tip....great bar!"
5,Fun time had by all!,"The staff bent over backwards to make our party feel welcome! They made sure my four year old granddaughter had her own robe and stuffed animal. Not having booked the right room, the guest check in staff made it work perfectly. We had a wonderful two days there."
3,Friendliness is no substitute for substance,"There’s a group of hoteliers who seem to substitute really enthusiastic staff for genuine service and good product and dare you to call them out on it. The Four Seasons Austin falls in this class. The rooms are small, especially the bathrooms and lack amenities like a bathtub and reasonable closet space. The staff at the concierge desk are young and enthusiastic, but aren’t actually trained concierges. Everyone who wants to shop is sent to South Congress St. The food is okay, but nothing exceptional. We ate breakfast there several times and were underwhelmed. However, it was substantially better than dinner. Not what you would expect from a Four Seasons. The spa was nothing more than a glorified fitness center. Nothing like it was represented on the website. And the pool outside is extremely small and outdated.The positives: Everyone was very friendly and the beds are comfortable. Worth the extra $$? Probably not."
5,Perfect,Is it possible to have a flawless hotel? This just may be it. Super comfortable and quiet with superb service. The bathroom was modern and felt as if it was new. Every one was super friendly too. Maybe it was the season or the training or both.
5,A truly remarkable experience,"The Four Seasons Austin always goes above and beyond. I travel for business, and coming back to the hotel after work is like entering an oasis. I can't say enough about this property - soft bed linens, calm, relaxing rooms, amazing restaurant food, and the friendliest staff ever. When I was sick and couldn't go into the office one day - a lovely employee brought me tea, lemons, and water, and made sure I was attended to throughout the day (at no extra charge). I travel a lot for business, and the Four Seasons Austin is the best hotel I've ever stayed at."
1,Fine Hotel,"Great stay, comfortable rooms, delicious beds, restaurant was excellent. Forgot an item in my room and they quickly located my item and sent to me by FedEx the next day. Staff was most courteous. I highly recommend Four Seasons Austin!"
4,Wonderful but overly expensive,"Perhaps the old refrain that you get what you pay for has application here. The concierge staff helped me though several problems that I had having nothing to do with my stay but might have adversely affected my trip to Austin to attend a wedding. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room was so Holiday Inn and unremarkable except for a Bose blue tooth speaker. The food at Trio was quite well prepared and tasted good.Overall it was a delightful and overly expensive stay. Fairly, had I been charged 25% less it would a fair price for the hotel and Trio, I just felt over-charged."
3,Not up to The Four Seasons' standards,"Poorly insulated walls in my room on the 6th floor. I could hear the conversations, coughing and TV blasting each evening/night. I got stuck in the elevator twice during my stay. The room had an old, musky odor to it. The smallest Four Seasons bathroom that I have yet to experience. Curtains are manual, which is no big deal, but they were not easy to open and shut manually. My worst Ritz / Four Seasons experience yet."
5,Gorgeous and Gracious,"Wonderful place to stay. Staff superb. Rooms beautifully redecorated. Great bar with live music. Perfect location -- right on Lady Bird Lake. Entire hotel immaculate. I look forward to my next visit -- hopefully, soon!"
5,Amazing Property,"I always love staying at this property when I am in town. Everything about it is excellent- the bar, restaurant, and service. The new room renovations have definitely freshened up the property. But the highlight of the rooms is the quality of the beds and sleep quality. This hotel is a MUST for Austin."
5,Truly Four Seasons Worthy,"My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons Austin for the first time in over a year on Nov 17-19.We have stayed there quite a bit over the years. My wife’s family stays there a lot as well.We’ve always enjoyed the location. It is one of best spots in Austin. However, we’ve stayed in other Four Seasons around the world and in comparison, the rooms in Austin always underwhelmed. They had become a bit dated over the years. While one always felt like the time spent in the lobby or out on the lake/lawn were Four Seasons’ exceptional, and the service unparalleled, the time in the rooms was fairly ordinary. Still, we appreciated the rest of the experience enough to continue booking, and we always had a great time.In addition, one other feature which we always found lacking was the gym. For a hotel of your size and stature, it always seemed a little small and lacking in features.So, I must tell you when we checked in on Nov 17, I knew something was afoot when we pulled into the drive and noticed the revamp on the ceiling of the front drive. The beautiful wood really stood out. As I stepped out of the elevator on our floor, I was delighted by the refurbishment of the elevator landing and the hallway. It almost felt like a Japanese motif/vibe. Quite beautiful. And finally, I was blown away when we checked into our room. The décor is STUNNING!! Understated, elegant, extremely well considered. BRAVO!!! I cannot tell you how overwhelmed both my wife and I both were. I immediately called down to the front desk to compliment them on the refurbishment.The next day, we visited the gym – and it is almost as if you read my mind. You made the gym the appropriate size, decked it out with those beautiful wood ceiling and walls, and put in amazing equipment.Add to that, new services (at least they were new to me as I don’t remember them): Champagne at check-in + tea service at night, and it was pure bliss.Anyway, you’re probably used to fielding a lot of complaints, so I hope this compliment makes you smile. You really exceeded our expectations. We will keep coming back. With smiles on our faces.You truly have a hotel worthy of the Four Seasons name."
5,Better than the Turkey this holiday season!,"Excellent all around! Highly recommend. Wonderfull with a great location. Perfect ""Stay"" cation if you live in the area. Just what we needed. Enjoyed walking to nearby shops. Great place to watch UT football or Talegate before the game."
5,Great service,We slept in and coffee was gone but they made sure we got fresh made two cups with all the extras we needed at noon! That was service to us. Who doesn’t still need their coffee. It is just the little things that matter sometimes and no other hotel would do this.
1,Four Seasons disaster.,"When a Four Seasons waiter spills an entire glass of red wine on your new white shawl and runs from the scene without an apology you are in shock. When you are left alone for several minutes to clean up the mess and when the manager arrives and asks what can I do for you? You are frozen in disbelief. The next day you decide to call the general manager before taking to social media and after a week he never returns your call...you are certain that service, hospitality and common decency are severely lacking at the Four Seasons Austin."
5,Perfect hotel,"This hotel has everything going for it. A convenient city location, yet serene park-like grounds, make it the perfect place to stay in Austin. The staff is too-notch and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The restaurant is great, and rooms were lovely."
5,A fantastic hotel,Would be difficult to find a better hotel. Staff was extremely helpful and very courteous. Room was very nice and was appointed really good. Bed was very comfortable. The bath and shower were also very nice.
5,Best Hotel in Austin,"Whenever possible, I stay at the Four Seasons in Austin. I have stayed here over twenty times and it never disappoints. The rooms have recently been redone are even better than before. The service and amenities are exceptional."
5,Great Hotel and Super service,"the entire experience for our weekend getaway was superb. The valet, bell staff, front desk and concierge were all friendly and helpful. Our room was great and the bathroom was roomy and really well done, loved the shower! The black out curtains were fantastic as it kept the room pitch black so my wife could sleep late. All in all I think the Four Seasons Austin is one of the best hotels we have stayed in over the years."
5,outstanding service and property!,"Outstanding comfort in and outside of the hotel room. Second time here, love it again! The food was outstanding and staff was very accommodating for setting up impromptu meetings. The beds were very soft and conducive to a good night's rest. Highly recommended."
5,Utkov Wedding,"We had wonderful service throughout the planning process. The Rehearsal, wedding and reception were perfect. The set-up for everything went smoothly and staff was excellent. The food was superior. My wedding planner worked side-by side with the Four Seasons event planner."
5,An extraordinary hotel!,the customer service at the Four Seasons Austin was fabulous. They seemed to anticipate my every request. Others in my group said the same. A wonderful hotel and kudos to the highly professional staff.
5,Great weekend at the best Hotel in Austin,"I have been fortunate to stay at the top hotels around the country and the FS is always excellent. The newly updated rooms were great, the bar is the best hotel bar in Austin and the exceptional service by Hotel Asst Mgr Hosea Eyob made it a perfect weekend. He went above and beyond to take care of our particular needs and made a lasting impression."
5,Great Oasis in Downtown Austin,Five star property with all the amenities in busy downtown Austin. With the lakefront property it is a great place to relax between meetings or gatherings with friends. The in room food was fantastic when I was stuck on a call during lunch.
3,Overpriced,So many hotels in the area that are way better. More food and dining options and more spacious. The room was really really small but very well put together. Sleep was great. Would be nice if they at least offered coffee. Super overpriced for a small hotel with few services.
5,Best Hotel Stay Ever,"I was in town to speak at the Texas book Festival. The Four Seasons staff could not have been more accommodating. The hotel is beautiful, and the guest rooms are large and nicely decorated. I was surprised to find a beautiful chocolate replica of the cover of my book created by the pastry chef on my bedside table! The fitness center is extraordinary, and there is a lovely walking trail along the river next to the hotel. I really enjoyed my stay at the Four Seasons and look forward to returning soon."
5,Wonderful location and fabulous hotel,"Fabulous location right on Waterfront, yet walking distance to downtown and great restaurants and music bars. Hotel seemed to be recently renovated and the overall hotel decor and the room was great. Lots of nice technology additions. (Loved the speakers and wind machine for sleeping!) Great outdoor areas with patios for dining and drinks. And service and staff were as great as you’d expect them to be at the Four Seasons. Lovely vibe to the place. Staff were lovely. Not at all stuffy."
5,Best Luxury Hotel in Austin,"We stayed at the Four Seasons for my wife’s birthday and thoroughly enjoyed our night. The updates, I️ think, make it the best luxury hotel in the city. Room 705 gave us a beautiful view of the river and the location is perfect for nightly activities. Love the spacious and cozy bar area with fireplace. The staff is very helpful and friendly."
5,"Superb hotel, excellent staff","Excellent hotel. Generous and beautifully appointed room and bathroom. Concierge superb, so helpful and pleasant. Nice foyer and bar/meeting area off the foyer. Good breakfast. Always taxis outside ready to go !"
4,Views and location make for a packed hotel,Spent several nights at the Four Seasons Austin while on business. The room were luxurious and seem to have been recently updated. Plugs/outlets in the night tables were great touch. The view of Lady Bird lake from my room was fantastic. The downside was that the hotel was at max capacity every night. The hotel bar was crowded each evening - no chance for a quiet conversation. Frustratingly- the 2 of the 3 hotel elevators were not working for my entire stay. Could take 10 minutes to get a elevator down to the lobby.
5,Four Seasons / Austin,a perfect weekend stay...great property on the river...great Trio restaurant (sit on outdoor patio) - nice Sunday buffet...rooms are all brand new 'contemporary design'....great massage @ spa...lobby and lobby bar w/ fireplaces
5,Setting The Standard,Had the pleasure to once again stay in a Four Seasons property. This hotel in Austin reflects the high standard of service and quality one has come to expect from this hotel chain. Quality is consistent across their properties in there U.S. and Europe.
5,Austin in style,"We stay at the four Seasons as often as we can. The staff is excellent, the valet's do a great job negotiating the traffic, and the bar scene at night is brilliant. The gym has been upgraded to reflect the true vision of a Four Seasons.. The Location on the lake is pristine and we enjoy the fresh bottled water at the end of a long run/walk... It is pet friendly, which I don't like but can deal w it... Pets are for the house..."
4,Exactly what you'd expect from a Four Seasons,"Entering the property you feel like you are in a lush country setting even though you are right in the heart of Austin. The hotel is right on the riverway park so you can take a short stroll or jog a half marathon. The lobby is inviting with a country club atmosphere. The restaurant has a bar with an inviting happy hour daily and a patio for dining out doors. The food was excellent in preparation, presentation and flexibility to accommodate restricted diets. The rooms very comfortable and relaxing. The gym was a busy place but there was enough equipment for all and and it was keep tidy. The locker rooms were spotless! Our spa services were excellent. There is a lovely outdoor pool on the property as well which, even though the temperatures were unusually hot for November, was practically deserted during our visit. Staff here was very pleasant and helpful. While our experience wasn't a WOW all in all it was exactly what you expect from a Four Seasons hotel. I would highly recommend the hotel and for all types of trips - business, friends, romantic getaway."
2,Fell Short of Expectations,"If you use American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program, choose another option in Austin. The features that accompany that program are outstanding, and are not all met or even mentioned here. The food is excellent and most of the staff is friendly, but elevators are loud and the noise effects sleep, especially if your room is next to an elevator, and at least eight on every floor are close enough for the ""ding"" to be a real problem."
5,My Austin review.,"The hotel staff were really great. All the staff we dealt with from the front desk, concierge, front doorman, pool and gym were very helpful. The grounds and pool are maintained so well. The location is perfect. Will gladly come again."
2,Not a Four Seasons,"I've stayed in many Four Seasons, and for the price, there is a specific level of service one expects. Unfortunately, all that this hotel has, is a name and overpriced rooms.We arrived on a Friday, as we pulled up, we waited for 10 minutes for valet or someone to come help us unload our car. We finally gave up and went and got our own cart to unload. As we unloaded the last bag, we finally had someone come ask if we needed help. We were fine by then. I should mention, if you bring your own car, it is an additional $45/night to park there, on top of tipping the valet.When we arrived, we asked to be placed on same floor (not even next to each other) with our friends. The best they could do? 2nd and 7th floor...When we walked in, our room view was the gravel rooftop. I failed to mention, we were hosting a $40,000 event that night; with approximately 200 people in attendance, of which majority stayed in the hotel.Our bathroom sink had ZERO water pressure; no matter if you opened hot or cold or both. You only had hot water or cold water, that dribbled out.I'm not sure when the coffee machines were taken out of the hotel rooms? Even Holiday Inn has Keurig or some sort of coffee machines in the rooms. You have to go downstairs to get coffee in the morning.The entire weekend, they only had ONE elevator running. I'm not sure if they reserve other ones for someone to come escort you out. You also couldn't take the stairs down because they led you outside to the back of the building, from which you had to walk around to get to the lobby.Upon check out, because we were on the 2nd floor, elevators were packed every time. We stood for 30 minutes waiting on an elevator that was semi empty. The solution that was given to us by the manager? We'll show you where the stairs are. I'm sorry, $600/night and you can't provide elevator service when we have luggage to drag down with us?! Unacceptable.During our event, which included dinner, the service was horrendous. I had to ask for water several times, no one came around to start serving our table with dinner until after I finally asked someone. I had to practically beg for someone to bring around the wine/drinks (which were payed for).This was our second, and last year, to host this event at Four Seasons."
5,Four Seasons was perfect for Fall,"Location, location and location with understated luxury thrown in. Would return in a heartbeat, just classy. Thouroughly enjoyed the hotel grounds with hammocks and fire pits for when it gets chilly. Trio was delicious, with a nice wine selection."
3,No coffee in the room,I was a little disappointed there was no coffee in the room so I had to go to the restaurant and pay $7.50 for one and wait in line so it took about 5 minutes. This isn't how I like to enjoy my relaxing morning. I also was looking forward to taking a bath and found only a large shower in the room which was also a bummer.
3,"Not the best experience, unlucky I hope","I was so excited to stay here, it is an amazing hotel but there were something that were frustrating for me. I happened to be leaving for a meeting at a time that a lunch function was letting out. I had valet parking and even though the staff worked hard to get every ones car, it still took 25 minutes to get mine and I was late for my appointment. If you are staying there you should get priority. Second the elevators were being worked on, and on several mornings, I waited as did many 15 minutes or more for an elevator. I am hoping that when I return in December things will be different as it is a great hotel."
5,"Amazing location, hotel, and staff","This place over exceeded my expectations. It was beautiful, clean, and the staff was amazing! Very close to everything and the restaurant is delicious. Highly recommended for business but also could see for family stays since the pool, fitness center, and shops are great."
4,Austin visit,Great location and amazing food. Lovely bar. Wonderful decor. Room views of town lake are breath-taking. My favorite place to stay in Austin. Easy to get in and out. Delicious morning free coffee bar.
5,Typically great Four Seasons experience!,"Beautiful hotel location with access to running/walking trails, nice pool, near Congress Bridge to watch the bats and the first class service you would expect. Plenty of great restaurants and bars within walking distance also!"
5,Four Seasons Austin,Newly remodeled and updated rooms at the hotel. Super clean and the staff is excellent as this is one of the best Four Seasons we have stayed at. You can't really call them staff at this hotel as they are more brand ambassadors and are willing to help you.
5,Awesome Experience,"One of the best vacations I have had in years. All the staff was great and was always available to help out or give advice. they were very well knowledge on places to go and eat. The hotel itself was amazing, highly recommend staying especially in one of the suites."
5,Luxury at its best,"When you think Four Seasin you think luxury, pampering, relaxing, a place to make you feel special, well there was no disappointment, if you owned your own hotel and walked into the lobby, staff would pay attention to your every need, this is how 4 days spent in the hotel felt."
5,Great Hotel when travelling with Children,"This hotel was excellent, especially traveling with my 1 and 3 year old. All the staff called them by name and went out of their way to make them feel happy and home like. They also provided tiny robes and slippers which my daughter loved. We even had a slightly imperfect arrival, to which i didn't complain as everything else was done so well. When i arrived at my room the next day they sent an apology note and cookies, which i thought was going above and beyond. I will definitely stay here again."
5,Always get what you pay for,"This hotel is our first choice while visiting Austin and San Antonio. Great staff, food, location and all around service. All food is great including restaurant and room service. The door people and concierge know their stuff!"
4,Luxurious...but I'm really bugged about the closets.,"The beds are wonderful, the bedding sublime, the Town Lake views are gorgeous and the service could not be more friendly and courteous... but... call me spoiled, but for $679/nt plus plus plus, I would expect to be able to hang a weekend's worth of clothes in the closet. The designers always screw up hotel rooms somehow, don't you think? The public areas are lovely, (if a bit dark,) but the closets are not tall enough for a gown nor wide enough for very few clothes! We travel with one carry-on each, but could not fit our clothes in this mini closet. And that horsey thing in the bathroom? CREEPY!"
5,Great experience,"The hotel has been recently remodeled and what was already a very nice hotel is now even better. The staff are courteous, helpful, and responsive. Check-in and check-out were quick and smooth. The valet was also very prompt."
5,Great place to stay in downtown Austin,"I enjoyed my stay here while I was travelling for business. The newly renovated rooms were comfortable and well done, with very nice technology touches worked into the design. The beds were wonderful and I slept very well. The service was outstanding and very personalized. As a business traveler, the only thing I missed was coffee in my room. I would definitely recommend - for the price compared to other hotels in the vicinity I thought the value was very high."
5,5+ stars,"If I could give more stars I would. I have been staying at the 4 Seasons in Austin since about 2011 and I have never once had a bad experience. Good food, great location, amazing spa and amentities, and excellent customer service. Also, the new renovations are BEAUTIFUL!! Sounds weird but my favorite part of every stay is walking in to the lobby because it always smells exactly the same."
5,Girls ACL weekend,"When in Austin, no better place to stay. The hotel and room renovations are very nice. Staff incredibly service oriented and friendly - what you expect from Four Seasons - they now how to do top shelf service"
5,First Trip to Austin,"Being my first trip to Austin for business, the group I was with had us all stay at this location. The facility is extremely clean and well kept. The staff was very helpful in giving me directions to some local and close attractions. Always very welcoming when the front door of the hotel is opened for you by the employees that are running the drive! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to the Austin area. The overall cost was a bit spendy but I am overall very pleased with my stay. All of the rooms have been completely re-done and are very clean. Thumbs up to the hotel and its employees. Happy travels!"
5,Fantastic,"From the moment I arrived I new this was going to be a fantastic stay!The establishment was clean, elevated and well staffed!The staff members were genuine, friendly and knowledgeable!I will definitely be staying here again.Top 3 hotels I've ever stayed in!"
5,Great trip to Austin,"Beautiful hotel, staff was really friendly and polite. Concierge gave us some great tips, we will definitely stay at this place again. We went for dinner outside hotel first night but it was totally unnecessary, next day we had dinner in restaurant that is in hotel and we had great experience...food, ambiance everything was top notch."
5,ACL Stay,"We hosted our grown-up kids for ACL weekend at the Four Seasons. It’s always been our favorite hotel, and it couldn’t have been more enjoyable. The staff always makes the guests feel special. And the renovated rooms are both beautiful and calming. Can’t wait to go back."
5,Great city views!!,Great location near night life! Restaurant and bar is very inviting but I ventured out to nearby spots with great food and drinks. Rooms are very nice with great big pillows. Very nice bathrooms the shower was really nice!
5,Best beds ever,"Very happy with room, beds, bathroom, location is right in the middle of everything. Front desk had a miscommunication with corporate regarding billing but resolved it quickly. front desk and concierge were very helpful"
5,An urban oasis,"Lovely renovation of hotel rooms, complete with a 'sleep' machine which proved to be helpful. Service and food at Trio (and in lobby bar) is always excellent! It's wonderful to be able to step outdoors onto the beautiful grounds and watch your grandchild at play with other children. Or to enjoy a game of 'corn hole' together! Staying here is always a delightful and relaxing experience!"
5,Best place to relax by Town Lake With a Glass ofvWine,"The back patio downstairs at the 4 Seasons is by far my favorite place to relax with a glass of wine by Town Lake. In fact, even though it’s in downtown Austin, it feels like a tranquil oasis with beautiful gardens all around and a great hammock too. Always stop here for a rink on any trip to Austin."
5,Take time to visit the bar,"It is a relaxing place to have a few beverages with softer music often in the 8pm range. Service is always great and it makes you feel and know what great service in a hotel is all about. In season, you can see the bats from there terraces at the Bar. It is my go to place in Downtown Austin to chill. It is a Four Seasons so no tank tops and beater tees shirts please!!"
1,Poo..Literally,"I stayed here for the weekend since my friend was getting married there. The first day, a maid barged in on me after giving me only one second after knocking to respond. Later, I come back to my things having been messed with. It was only a couple hours after check in, so I didn't think I needed the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign yet. Clearly I was wrong. The next day while I was downstairs getting ready for the wedding, someone decided to go in my room and take a huge dump in my toilet and leave it. I was only given a ""we'll look into it"" by the front desk. That's great and all, but that doesn't make me feel any less disturbed -now- or make me want to go back to my room to stay the remaining night. At the outrageous prices they charge, I expected more than ""we'll take care of it, but probably after you're gone..if at all."" The managers didn't seem too concerned that my privacy had been invaded, not once, but 3 times. You don't get what you pay for here..just a headache and special ""presents"" left in your toilet."
5,Still The Best,We had not stayed at this property for a few years. It is still outstanding. From the guys at the front drive to the front desk personal to the breakfast staff. They were all outstanding and eager to help. The location on Town lake is also fantastic. They are still finishing up the renovations. However it did not interfere with our stay. Rooms were quiet. Loved the white noise machine. Only issue was slow elevators. I think might set might not be working yet. However that should be fixed soon.
5,Texas Business,Four Seasons Austin is a beautiful hotel that is very comfortable. The staff is very accommodating and courteous. The hotel is newly remodeled and gorgeous. It has a great location. The concierges are very friendly and informative. They know the surroundings well. I highly recommend it for the price.
5,Great stay!,"Close to the active trail that parallels the Colorado River, making for a quick and easy walk to see the city. Also very close to the ""bat bridge"" for easy sightseeing. Very well-maintained hotel with beautiful amenities, modern, well-equipped fitness center, and excellent food!"
5,University of Texas Game,We had drinks in the bar where the service was fantastic. The drinks were well made and the view of the river was magnificent. You have a great view of the bridge the bats come from in clouds of black each evening during certain times of the year. The hotel is a wonderful hotel and has great people to assist you.
4,Four Seasons Austin,I enjoyed my stay at Four Seasons in Austin. The staff is professional and cordial. The hotel atmosphere is cozy and inviting. When staying at this property beware of the consequences for needing to leave early due to unforeseen emergencies. They will charge you for the original number of nights you booked regardless of your circumstance to leave early/abruptly. Such was the case with me as I had to pay for unused nights.
4,"Clean & comfortable, friendly staff","I stayed here for one night with my sister in order to visit Austin.Booking was easy. I booked online, via my airline's website, using airline miles. I called Four Seasons directly a few days later to confirm the booking. I also called Four Seasons to request early check in and late check out, and they kindly agreed to accommodate both (for late check in, they said they could only confirm that after I had physically checked into the hotel).I was also looking at the W Hotel, but ultimately chose the Four Seasons because it was on the lake and because it seemed more peaceful. I selected a lake view room, even though it was a bit more, because reviews said the view was worth it. Some reviews stated that there was construction noise. So I requested a room far from the construction.Check in was easy and the front desk staff members were friendly. Across from the front desk was cold ice water infused with fresh fruits and herbs which was refreshing.Our room was clean, comfortable and the view was beautiful. We could see kayakers and paddle boarders on Lady Bird Lake. The decor was modern while still maintaining a comfortable, cozy feel. We received a lovely chocolate and nut board upon arrival in our room including a realistically shaped white chocolate cowboy boot. We slept very well on the two double beds with fluffy pillows. L'Occitane bath products were a treat. The room as quiet and peaceful and we didn't hear any construction noiseThere are hammocks outside for use, but be careful sitting in them as they can flip easily. I took a swim in the pool. The hotel's website describes the pool as saltwater, but when I swam in it, I didn't feel especially buoyant. The pool wasn't as gorgeous or luxurious as I'd hoped for a Four Seasons but it was fine.Valet parking worked well. At $45 per night, it's a hefty price I would expect in New York City or Chicago but not in Texas. However all the luxury hotels in downtown Austin seem to charge about the same amount for valet without offering a lower priced self park option. I didn't see another easy option for parking. The hotel billed my room account for the valet parking. The parking attendants were prompt and friendly.We didn't dine in the hotel nor use the spa services. I saw live music playing in the lobby area where people were having drinks. We walked about five minutes north on San Jacinto for breakfast at a small crepe cafe (Cafe Crepe) and enjoyed tasty breakfast crepes.I would certainly stay in Four Seasons Hotel Austin in the future."
4,"Great stay after renovations, terrible valet experience","I've stayed at this property a few times and this is the first since the renovations. Check-in was great, the upgraded room was lovely (I always love the L'Occitane products!), and almost everyone I came in contact with was wonderful. The only issue I had was with the valet guys, who were extremely rude to me. I had asked for my car to be kept in front as I would be back downstairs and needed to leave in a few minutes and they agreed - unfortunately, they neglected to do this, which was inconvenient but understandable if they forgot since it was busy. However, it was my subsequent experiences with the main valet guy that really made me question the service at this property. When I asked where my car was and that I had confirmed it could be kept in front for a few minutes while I checked in, he rudely asked me if I was a guest at the hotel or why I was there. If I had checked in, I am obviously staying at the hotel. Upon my return to the hotel that night, he wasn't helping anyone else but stood by the door and did not come to my car. I waited in my car for a minute, then left the key in the car and walked into the hotel, I said the keys are in the car and the guy just looked at me. Overall a great stay, but I would probably walk further and park at a nearby garage to avoid this valet experience again."
5,"Fantastic venue, food and atmosphere - conference or pleasure",The recent redesign of the hotel is amazing. All the rooms are updated and absolutely gorgeous -like a designer created it just for you. The food and service was incredible - even for a large banquet setting. I will never go anywhere else in Austin when I have a choice.
5,High standards at Four Seasons,Always enjoy Four Seasons. Attended conference here and meeting rooms were excellent. Room was a dream - never have problems sleeping at Four Seasons. Great amenities for our 2 year old. Felt special entire time here.
2,"Brunch was great, Service not so much","Made brunch reservations to celebrate my wife's birthday based on all of the great reviews. We live in Austin and were not staying at the hotel. Wonderful brunch selection. All of the standard brunch fare presented nicely. The waiter was pretty rude to us. Acted put out when we asked for anything, ""forgot"" things a few times and was downright insulting at one point. When we told him that this was a special occasion and we really felt his condescending attitude was uncalled for, he told us we were welcome to speak to his manager. Basically ruined the meal for us. I think had we been hotel guests or had a different waiter it would have been a wonderful experience. However, based on what we experienced I will never return."
5,True Hospitality,This hotel exemplifies hospitality. The spa is amazing and the salt water pool is a treat. The rooms are very nice and the view facing the river is beautiful. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is delicious.
5,First time staying at a Four Seasons!,It won't be my last. Perfectly done from check in to check out. Great team in Austin! Great location and the staff went out of their way to be helpful from directions to helping me with transportation. Had 2 brerakfast meetings and the food and service were a 10. Just first class all theway.
5,Great hotel,Service was superlative. Will be better when they finish their renovations and there isn't hammering while I am taking a nap to try to get rid of a headache. Spa doesn't have manicure or pedicure services. Only real disappointment.
5,Great experience,"I stayed in the newly renovated room and it was just fantastic. Beautiful room, great view, great location, great staff, great service! When I come back again, I will be bringing my wife to enjoy this lovely hotel with me."
4,"Overall a great stay at this beautiful property, but couple of minor issues","On the plus side, the rooms were big and spacious, the wifi worked well and the grounds are amazing. It's expensive, but first rate property.One thing I didn't like was the construction going on. All around our room were renovations going on during the day. So only during the day, not at night. But you still heard drilling and banging throughout the day. That was a problem when I was trying to make calls and work in the room. It was renovations planned in advance, so they should have blocked our room area off and just not had people in it. Or checked with us when we checked in. But instead the first we knew of it was when we got to the room and found a letter on the table explaining it. For a high end hotel like this, not a cool way to do this.Next, the ice machine on our floor was out of service during the renovations. So instead they came by in the morning and filled up your ice bucket, which was a nice touch. But later on when you needed ice, you had to call for it. So points for trying, but not what I expected.Finally, we ate in the hotel restaurant. When the bill came, it already had an 18% tip added. The service was very good, but that's my choice to make and I'm already paying outrageous prices for the food (breakfast for two was $75USD). So leave that to me. And if you are going to add the tip automatically do not leave an additional line for ""Tip"" so that people end up paying it twice, not realizing it was added automatically (like our friends did). I don't mind tipping for good service, but really find it insulting when people demand it."
5,4 seasons Austin,fantastic albeit brief stay; staff attentive; room sizable and comfortable; very nice location on water with views and walking / jogging trail. great food and bar. Will recommend it to others looking for business stays.
3,Nice hotel but not worth the money,"We enjoyed a night in Austin for a ""staycation"" and chose the Four Seasons. I debated over this property and the JW but ended up choosing this hotel. The hotel is newly renovated and they are still under renovation. We could hear some of the construction going on while there. This information would have nice to know prior to booking, not during check-in. The bar is small (four or five stools) and the selection could be improved (the bourbon for sure). We went off property for dinner and had breakfast at the hotel. It was good but nothing about it was memorable. All in all the hotel is nice but next time we will try the JW. There was just not a wow factor during our stay."
5,Superb!,"This hotel is at the top of the best hotels - it is rated wonderful plus!! From the warm reception by staff when you arrive, to the personal note in your room, everything is exquisite. Staying at this hotel actually instills a feeling of exhilaration. Further, on Friday and Saturday evenings you can enjoy music in the bar area and feel very at home even if you are alone."
5,Perfect Escape in the Center of Downtown Austin,"From the recently renovated rooms (which are beautifully designed) to the exceptionally expected Four Seasons service, I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Austin for work or pleasure. The amenities are top notch from the gym/spa to the backyard complete with fire pits, hammocks and a peaceful setting on the lake."
4,Good hotel and location. Going through renovation.,"Very nice hotel in Austin. Renovations are well done and the hotel looks good. That being said, we had booked a suite and upon check in were informed that there was a problem and the no suites were available. This was beyond their control, but then follow through by the management was not up to par to make sure we were satisfied with our reservation. We ended up in a smaller room that was nice. A suite ended up available after we were settled in the smaller room so we didn't change rooms. Left messages for the manager to ask for compensation which were not returned. This is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. Work out facilities and spa are very good."
5,Four Seasons Hotel Austin Rocked....,"We loved our stay from start to finish. Especially loved when we checked in Solar Eclipse was happening and they gave us glasses to view. Little touches like that and the amazing welcome platter of a big white chocolate cowboy boot was sweet. Room was nice and service was first rate. Love restaurant for dinner and breakfast and complimentary coffee-tee service in the morning with a a large variety of newspapers was nice. Wish we had time to fully use spa but enjoy using it for sauna, showers and relaxation room was a great place to chill. I would and will stay here again. We loved our stay."
5,Great updates,The new updates to the rooms on the top floors and down have been great. Super job done....This hotel is the perfect place to stay if visiting the Austin area. Plenty of things to do within two to three blocks of the hotel. ALL staff members are super to everyone that comes and stays.
5,Favorite Four Seasons,"The location may not be exotic, but the staff is the best: friendly yet professional. Rooms have been renovated since I last stayed at this location, and they seem both modern and traditional (in other words, for me, not trendy like some hotels tend to me)."
5,Four Seasons Austin Texas,"Allysa Valls and the entire staff of the Four Seasons made our stay memorable. Everyone knew our names. The room, the food, room service were all excellent. It's all in the details and they thought of everything. Oh yes, they even have white noise machines in every room!"
5,Feels like going home,"Travel to Austin once a year for one night for a sporting event and stay at this hotel. Staff always makes you feel welcomed and service is attentive, but not obtrusive. Comfortable rooms and unique drinks at the bar only add to the short, but wonderful stay."
5,Best hotel in Austin,I came here last minute to get out of the hurricane. As a touring musician I stay in a lot of hotels. They offered a very nice guitar to take to my room which I've never seen anywhere. If I had the budget I'd move in tomorrow. Beautiful place.
2,Don't plug in,Wires hanging down from the desk like a $20 a night hotel. Wall sockets are so cheap they will not even hold an iPhone charger. Worst Four Seasons room ever. We referred to hotel as Three Seasons. Definitely the worst Four Seasons I have ever been to.
5,Home away from Home,The Four Seasons in Austin is my favorite hotel - we have continued to stay here for the past ten years. The service and attention was excellent and the surroundings are beautiful We stayed here for a week during Harvey and the staff was unbelievably welcoming to myself and my family and our fur babies. They are renovating the rooms and we love the new look and feel.
4,Very nice stay at the FS Austin,"Our family stayed at the FS over UT move in weekend. We had two rooms, one facing the river, the other with a city view. The river view was worth the extra as it's a beautiful view and the bonus is that there is a colony of 3 million bats that live under the bridge that you can see from the room and in the evening they all take off, it's amazing and the view from up in the room is really spectacular. The rooms are comfortable and attractive, the hotel is well located, well trained staff and we really enjoyed the breakfast at Trio. You can walk to both the 6th street area and to Rainy St. restaurants as well. We did not hang out at the pool but it looked peaceful and comfortable with a nice location along the river. The gym was nice, with large windows and a good selection of equipment. The locker room was a little dated, my daughter had a spa treatment and enjoyed it. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that there was construction/remodeling on our floor which featured saws, drills, hammering, etc. We were not warned that this would occur nor were any ""treats"" offered to compensate. Our rate was fairly reasonable, perhaps this is why? We would definitely stay there again."
5,Comfortable stay,"Everthing is goog including staff service and environment around the hotel. Lake view is gorgeous and ease our fatigue. If selfparking system is installed, it is easier for the people to stay long as family vacation."
5,Best Nights of Rest EVER,"I was at the hotel for a conference, so I didn't use many of the amenities that a leisure guest would. I did eat in the hotel for one lunch and it was really good. What you would expect from a luxury hotel. But the bed was the best part of the stay. I have even looked into buying one, which you can do straight from the hotel! Great place. No complaints."
5,Beautiful view of Austin,I love this hotel because it has a beautiful view of Austin and the lake. I also love that it is so close to everything and within walking distance to many restaurants. It has a beautiful area to sit and relax outside. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. It's a perfect place to stay when visiting our son at UT.
5,Incredible Service-Second to NONE!,"From the front drive smiling faces to the in room dining host/hostesses, I can't brag enough on the staff. I hosted a Reception on the 22nd of August and the wait staff was simply superb. The men and women who work for the Four Seasons take their jobs seriously. It is so refreshing to walk into an event and have the team serving the event know you by your first name and go out of their way to truly deliver a memorable experience to all guests. Please do check and see who worked the TAAHP Reception on 8-22-17 and thank them for me again. TRIO continues to delight and the bar in the lobby has men and women who are professional and warm and inviting too!"
4,"Decent hotel, good location","Stayed here for the week recently and have no complaints. If it was just any hotel I would probably have given it a 5 star rating, but since it is a Four Seasons, I have to compare with my stays at hotels of a similar grade.Everyone was nice and pleasant, the rooms were clean and comfortable as you would expect but I did not feel like I was in anything but another 5 star hotel. The hotels that separate themselves from other 5 star hotels apart from providing a 5 star service offer the distinguishing differences e.g. where was the complimentary shoe polish service?This is a good hotel, in a great location with excellent service. I stayed on a high floor with city views in a newly renovated room, there was work going on in other rooms on the floor but I was never around to be disturbed by it and there was very little evidence of it. It is a 10-15 min walk to the downtown 6th street area which is where all the bars and clubs in Austin are concentrated, parking can be difficult so might be better walking especially since Uber does not operate in Austin. Valet parking in the hotel is $45 a night which is about the same as other downtown hotels.There is plenty of choice for food and walking straight down from the hotel up to 6th straight will bring you to a food truck park, some of the food trucks in Austin offer some great food to go, i would highly recommend giving it a try."
5,"Beautiful hotel, great location!","I stayed here recently for business but the hotel was fantastic. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfy. The location is great as well, close to Rainy Street and other great restaurants. Staff was always friendly and helped if you needed something."
4,Stay at the Four Seasons,Going under renovations wait until completed. There is construction and only one of three elevators were working the other two were for the construction firms. Four Season still has great staff and the renovated rooms are very nice. The landscaping needs a makeover as well. The elevator issue was a bummer.
5,We enjoyed a lot,"Great location, food (Sunday brunch was incredible) and the presentation in general was fantastic.We enjoyed our stay, and we really enjoyed a ping pong table they had. The invited band playing in the lobby on Friday made our evening. Thank you!!!"
3,"NIce hotel, but customer service a bit lacking.","This hotel is very nice and I had the opportunity to stay in a newly remodeled room. The housekeeping staff were outstanding, servicing my room twice a day. My primary complaint was the handling of my stay by the front desk with an overbilling for my stay. I was there on business along with a colleague. After checking out, I discovered that my bill was almost twice that of my colleague that arrived and checked out at the same time. I was billed an additional $170 because the group booking had exceeded it's limit. They also charged an additional night.After contacting the accounting office, the additional night was credited, but the group booking charge was not. My issues are more with the resulting hassles than anything else."
5,Conference,"I was ta the Four Seasons for a conference and found the staff very helpful, the room comfortable and the location convenient to many of the nighttime activities. The meeting facilities were good and every portion of the event was well orchestrated."
5,No better hotel experience - ever!,Great hotel stay. Everything was what you would expect from a luxury hotel. Well done. Rooms were great. AC was cool. Staff was friendly. Location in downtown was perfect. Staying in Austin was the highlight of my summer.
5,GREAT HOTEL EXPERIENCE,"The recent stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin was most enjoyable from arrival to departure. Staff was most courteous and helpful, friendly in all areas. Hotel was great in common areas and the room accommodations were most enjoyable. I always look forward to staying at the Four Seasons as I know I will have an enjoyable stay and a good night's sleep in the absolute most comfortable bed I have ever encountered in all my years of travel anywhere!"
5,UT move in,"We were in Austin To help our daughter who attends UT move into her new apartment. We stay at Four Seasons frequently and enjoy the location and staff. They are undergoing renovations and are about finished. The rooms are nice and quite modern now. We had a beautiful view of the lake. We spent Saturday afternoon by the pool and were treated to fresh fruit, cool cocktails and even getting our sunglasses clean. There were a few complaints about the beer being hot since it had to be poured into plastic glasses but the staff was accommodating by wrapping carafes in wine chiller bags or placing the carafes in ice. Guess they should have elected the cocktails ! They offered transportation to dinner via the hotel car which was nice. Four Seasons is consistent and always accommodating. Truly one of the nicest places to stay while in Austin !"
5,Service sets Four Seasons Apart,"Service was wonderful. All the special touches for kids really made the trip-small robes, treats, scavenger hunt. Rooms being redone which will be great. Fabulous service by the pool and bar as well. Coming back soon!"
5,Four Seasons People Are Remarkable,"I speak nationally and internationally primarily to dental audiences on creating on excellence and how to create a remarkable experience. Four Seasons is my Gold Standard - every detail is attended to - however, it is their people that truly distinguish them from all the other top tier hotels. Their genuine friendliness, authenticity and personalization of your experience is amazing. If you want a very personal level of service that exceeds expectations stay at the Four Seasons. Dr. Frazer"
5,Luxurious Downtown Location,"This hotel provides luxurious accommodations, the convenience of a downtown location, and the view/experience of a remote, lakeside resort. The staff goes out of its way to make every guest feel as though they are just that...a guest."
5,Wonderful Staff,The staff of this hotel is impeccable. They attended to everything I requested and were very prompt. The hotel is in phenomenal. The bed was the best hotel bed I ever slept on. I would be happy to stay there again.
5,Always a pleasure!,"An oasis of relaxation in the midst of a bustling city that never stops. Location is ideal for business or pleasure. Personalized service, amenities, outstanding food and beverage and quiet, soothing environment adds to your enjoyment."
5,Four Seasons Austin,Great venue! Beautiful views! Awesome Austin location. Love the lake and walking trail. Near 'bat bridge'. Lots of restaurants and shopping close by. Highly recommend this hotel and this area of Austin.
1,Hot water not working.,Hot water not working at 850 a night. Not a call yet to rectify the debacle from management. Water leaking on bathroom floor as well. Not on par with a five star stay. Management should be proactive in addressing.
5,Elegance and accessibility,"Four Seasons Austin is the gold standard for hotels in Texas' state capital. The service, the comfort and the food are all outstanding. I always hate to leave. The concierge team is well trained and can offer advice on hairdressers and the best way to get from Point A to Point B. They are also very helpful in assisting with travelers with special needs."
5,Amazing Urban Oasis,"My wife and I had been to 20 Four Seasons Resorts before arriving at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin. We were truly blown away by the recent renovations. The property itself was truly luxurious and the highly professional staff was remarkable (even by Four Seasons standards). The restaurant, pool, gym, and other facilities were impeccable."
5,Amazing night,From the moment I arrived to the moment I left I was treated amazingly. It is the best experience I have had in over thirty years of travel. I can't wait to go back. You have to try room service it is fantastic.
5,Friends trip,"We went to Austin with friends. The hotel, staff and restaurant were top notch. The restaurant at the hotel was really great. Probably the best food we had in Austin. Spa was phenominal. Been many times and will go again."
5,Best of the Best,"As a local Austin resident I have to say Four Seasons is by far the best luxury hotel we have stayed at downtown. Exceptional customer service, amenity's, dinning, lounge, ambiance, and over all comfort. Steps from Lady Bird Lake running trail. Congress bridge bat viewing. Trio has one of the best steaks and wine list that I've seen."
5,Ahhhh-some!,"Gorgeous hotel. Have stayed there twice and both times my experience was ""ahhh-some"". The staff took great care of me so I was able to relax and focus my energies on my business meeting prep rather than worry about my basic comforts- great room temp, comfy bed, lighted mirror in the bathroom, good iron, etc. They know that little touches mean a lot, like leaving me an Austin themed mouse-pad on the desk for my laptop and providing hair gel and a diffuser for my curly hair (humidity is high in Austin!). Can't thank the staff enough for anticipating my needs and being consistent with your service!!"
5,Super installations and superior service,It is not the first time I stay at this location and even though the hotel is under renovation we hardly noticed! The pool was at great temperature. Service is way above average. Will no doubt at comping back soon.
4,Very good with some limitations,"The hotel is quite nice but with the typical overpriced valet ($ 45/night) and is currently undergoing construction. The bed is very comfortable and the shower nice. The bathroom items are quite cheap. Unfortunately, the hotel rooms are poorly insulated so ask for a room away from the construction noise (hammering most of the day) and the elevator, which you will hear through the door like you were there. I found a hair in my food there which made me cringe. You may be offered the $ 100 ""incidental"" credit for the noise. In my opinion, this was insufficient. Further, be aware that it will be applied to your incidental charges in the order that they appear on your bill, and not ""ad hoc"" as you would like them. For example, if you use the $ 100 at the spa, the spa bill may remain on your record and the credit taken off meals. This can prove difficult for a business account."
5,"Professional and warm, friendly service","All staff strove to give professional and top-notch service while keeping an air of relaxed southern manners. They were warm, friendly, and professional. Perfect location to walk up Congress Ave to restaurants, clubs, and State Capitol as well as walk the other direction across Congress Ave Bridge and the food/shops on South Congress. Great to have access to the kayaks/paddleboards just a few feet from the back of the hotel."
5,"Four Seasons Hotel - Austin, Texas","Amazing mini vacation for us! We were welcomed and made to feel ""right at home"". The staff, expecially at the Concierge desk were so helpful and friendly! Room service was spectacular and fast! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
5,Great location and hotel in Austin,"Already a great Austin choice, the hotel rooms are being renovated/updated which is great news. Location, location, location. The hotel is an Austin oasis. It's close to all the fun, easy walking to the best strips of bars and restaurants but situated quietly on the river. SO you can party or chill with ease. AMAZING staff, help everywhere you turn if you want it, but not obtrusive if you want privacy and to simply relax."
5,Will be making a return visit,The hotel was situated in a great location - allowing my group to walk to dinner at Eddie V's. The staff were all exceptionally friendly from the moment I arrived with the car. Check-in process was smooth and uneventful. Although I was notified at the desk that there was some remodeling taking place I neither saw nor heard any construction noise. They offered tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning and this also included little muffins. The rooms were spacious and comfortable - offering ample room to get some work down before going to sleep. The bathroom amenities i.e. shampoo/conditioner were lovely. Next time I go to Austin I won't be staying anywhere else.
5,A great place,Traveled to Austin on business and stayed here. The service was excellent. Booked a small conference room and needed a few last minute changes/accommodations. The staff took care of them promptly. I saw comments about some of the facility being dated - that was not generally my experience. I highly recommend this property.
5,4 Seasons with 5 Stars,This hotel is the benchmark of customer satisfaction. My wife and I have been staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin for many years. The staff continues to find ways to improve their exceptional service.
5,Hot time in Austin-99 degrees,"While it was an average of 98 degrees during our stay, the hotel was always a perfect temperature and the rooms immaculate and cool. The pool attendants were top notch and very attentive. Breakfast was perfectly prepared and served hot. The suite was well appointed and very comfortable."
5,Four Seasons experience,"Always a great experience at The Four Seasons! The service is impeccable, the quality of food delicious, the amenities fine. Rooms with view of the lake and centrally located near everything downtown Austin, Texas. A+"
5,"Perfect location in downtown, excellent service, will be back to the FS Austin!","Coming in for a convention, we had a long day of broken promises, bruised egos, and bewildering delays... which got us to the FS Austin just after midnight... however, upon arrival, Owen welcomed us to the Texas capital city and made us feel right at home. He was great about accommodating our request and offered us refreshments due to our delirium from delays. He's one of the reasons we would come back to the FS Austin... great customer service and true concern for our well being as guest... thanks Owen!Once we were able to get to our rooms, they were what I have come to expect from a FS, understated elegance and comfort, the hallmarks of the FS brand. Breakfast was a delight on the patio, which allowed for people watching along the River and a beautiful view of the immaculate grounds.Our journey here was for an Expo at the Austin convention center, which was only a couple minutes walk from the front door of the FS Austin. We had materials shipped in, and the bell staff and front desk crew were extremely accomodating with receiving it for us, as well as keeping the boxes to ship back to our office as well. Again, FS Service on full display in Austin.Concierge was very helpful and implemented a reservation plan that included Geraldine's and La Condesa... see reviews. Pool, facilities, etc, were all in excellent condition, and I unfortunately did not have a chance to visit the Spa... although I was enticed.. All in all, the FS Austin delivered above and beyond, which is why I would recommend, and I will return."
4,Very nice but ...,This is a great property with excellent food. Rooms are very nice but not as great as one would expect for the cost. Staff was very friendly and attentive. We stayed for a whole week and enjoyed it.The pool is small but plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. Drinks are pricey but it is the Four Seasons.
5,Fantastic Stay!,This was my first stay at a Four Seasons and it couldn't have been better. The main reason was the entire staff working here is so helpful and happy! Try the restaurant Trio-amazing food! We would definitly stay here again.
5,Favorite hotel in Austin!,"I just simply love the Four Seasons Austin! From the moment you drive in to the moment you leave, the stay is flawless. The valets are incredible, the front desk cheerful and helpful, the concierge knowledgeable, the room keeping quick and efficient and all the other small touches make this an incredible stay. It's my go to hotel for Austin!"
5,Wonderful Hotel worth every cent,"As it sits beside Lady Bird Lake in Austin, the location can not be beat! Especially if you like to walk/run every day. Fresh coffee in the lobby every morning to get you started and excellent service. Very friendly staff that go one step beyond what is expected, and fastest valet car delivery I've ever experienced. Would have been nice, however, to have a coffee machine in the room. The espresso machine in the lobby, helped to make up for that shortcoming. This will be my new default for all my future Austin business trips."
5,Recent stay,We enjoyed our stay in Austin. The hotel was great and the staff very friendly and helpful. The lake view was awesome! We enjoyed the location as we could walk to the Capitol building etc. the setting of the hotel was perfect for us.
5,Great Hotel,I had a great stay at the hotel. I could not have asked for more. The service was a amazing! I recommend the four seasons to anyone that plans to stay in Austin. It is centrally located to the river and downtown. Great views and amenities. A+ in my book. Thanks for the great stay.
4,Great value for a four aeasons,"There are definitely newer and hipper hotelOptions in downtown Austin but the value was great and the service and attention to detail great. They are goi g through a ""property enhancement"" which is four seasons double talk for renovation. It is a little dated but well cared for. Make sure to avoid floors they are working on."
5,Perfect Stay,"I stayed at this hotel last summer and reported some service shortcomings. Thanks to the hotel management and staff, this year's stay was splendid. The service levels were top-notch from start to finish. My personal room preferences were accommodated and the staff, without fail, was prompt, smiling and cordial. The spa area had been renovated with an improved exercise area. I was forewarned that room renovations were underway, but I experienced absolutely no inconvenience. I enjoy the pool/spa aspect of this property and will stay again!"
5,Business and Bats,"We had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons. Everyone was warm and personable. Whether entering or leaving the hotel, we were greeted by several staff members. I felt like everyone working there truly love their jobs. I am a bit picky when it comes to my pillows and the ones in my room were the best EVER! Turns out it was a nice short walk to the Congress Avenue bridge to watch the bats flight at sunset."
4,Great Spot,"Great location, very clean, friendly staff. Their ""backyard"" is pretty neat for the outdoor enthusiast with plenty of walking/jogging paths, a dock is nearby where you can rent kayaks which was a lot of fun. Our room was great!"
5,Very Pleasant,"The stay at the Austin Four Seasons was great. The beds were wonderful and the rooms very quiet. Sleeping well is key to a successful visit to any place away from home. It was fabulous. Valet was the best way to park and the gentlemen were quick, prompt and professional when retrieving our vehicle. The location on the Lady Bird Lake is very pleasant. We were able to walk to the boat tours to see the bats one evening. Our stay this summer was excellent and our stay at the Four Seasons was key to this excellence."
4,"Not perfect, but very good","This hotel is a very good hotel, but not exceptional. The rooms are a little dated and the health club plus swimming pool are a little beneath what I expect from a Four Seasons. However where the hotel is top notch is in it's location and it's grounds. Austin is an outdoors town when it come to activities and this hotel is a perfect place for such being next to the river."
5,Austin Four Seasons,"We have stayed at this hotel every summer for a week long conference in Austin for the past five years. We love our experience with this hotel; the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed, even calling us by name during our stay. Great place at a great value!"
3,Please update your billing and reservation system,The billing system is an issues. The system is terribly outdated and the staff has a difficult time making adjustments. The rooms and property is beautiful. The remodel looks great and the staff is very friendly.
5,No Need to Leave,"Service beyond compare! The pool is gorgeous and we'll staffed, the outdoor seating area is so comfortable it makes it difficult for leave! The staff is attentive and went out of their way to accommodate our daughters, who were there for a figure skating competition, with an earlier than normal breakfast complete with a Good Luck message and a bag of healthy snacks to take with them. These small touches meant the world to the girls and to us as parents as well."
5,Four Seasons... Five Stars!,"From the moment we arrived, we experienced nothing but welcoming smiles and top-notch service! Any and every request was greeted warmly and addressed without hesitation. The staff,in its entirety, truly makes one feel welcomed and appreciated. This alone is a reason to choose the Four Seasons!The room itself would be viewed as above average in appointment but quite comfortable. Our room faced San Jacinto Blvd (main road/entrance) though given the building's setback, there were no issues whatsoever regarding noise, etc. We would imagine the rear-facing rooms to be far better as they offer views of the pool and river (perfect for watching the bats take off from under the Congress Avenue Bridge- a must see at dusk!).The grounds, on the other hand, are simply beautiful and tastefully landscaped. Their are two hammocks available, perfect for afternoon naps, as well as several very comfortable lounge chairs/couches along with firepits. All are under the shade of mature trees. VERY peaceful.The pool, though on the smaller end, does not have a 'bad seat' as long as sun and/or a sun-tan is what you're looking for (FYI... it was brutally hot during our stay). That being said, finding libations is not an issue, as it appears servers can be found virtually anywhere.The hotel is in great proximity to MANY restaurants, bars, and the infamous 6th Street, all a short walk away. But if you're looking to get 'away from it all' you need only go to the back of the hotel as it is linked to a pathway to the park that runs parallel to the river. Again, wonderful shading and peaceful.Though the hotel offers a gym and spa, we did not partake of either. It is a vacation, afterall.All in all, a great time was had and it all started with our 'five star welcome'. Very much appreciated."
3,Not one of the top 4 seasons properties,"Good location, nice rooms. Bar was tiny - not built for socializing.Pool felt old. Could have been a pool at any average hotel (except the towels/seat covers - those are great). No hotel connection to the Colorado river - so you need to use other vendors to enjoy it (beyond looking at it). Lastly, the $45 a day parking fee really irritates me."
5,Outstanding service!,"The room is just a room. Well maintained and clean, but just a room. The service, however, is the reason to stay here. You will want for nothing. From the bellmen to reception to the staff at Trio, everyone is exceptional."
5,Great hotel central to everything,"This hotel is central to everything that is Austin. Great spot on the lake, close to the nightlife and incredible food that keeps Austin Weird. Also, a getaway retreat away from all of that when it is time for some quite."
5,Four Seasons- Austin,"Lovely stay, centrally located to the conference center. Food quite good, staff attentive. Overall an outstanding stay! My only open issue is lack of alignment with hotel rewards program. Would recommend for a stay in Austin."
5,What a hotel! Best service I have witnessed anywhere in the world,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference happening at the Austin convention center. I must point out that for the class of this hotel, the property, the lawns and the room were not out of the world. But what was really standout was their service. I never had to ask for anything! I'd walk into the room after a long tiring day, the AC would be running at just the right temperature, there would be light music playing in the radio, and everything I had strewn around before I rushed out for my meetings, was all folded and kept in such a proper way that I will just end up marveling if there was an angel who visited my room! Call the service number for anything and the response was prompt. When they said 5 minutes, they meant it. I have cribbed about laundry in my previous review about a hotel in Manhattan. Guess what - these guys did laundry as if they really wanted me to look good. The quality of starch, ironing, folding, and boxing was so impeccable that I felt I was wearing a new set of clothes. The laundry tags were also easily removable. I cant thank them enough for being so considerate and careful. It means a lot when you need things when you need it in a hectic travel schedule. The property was small but refreshingly distinct in a downtown location - next to the lake, extremely green, with hammocks. It is such an unbelievable property for the location it is in. It is almost like running into the central park, while you are all weary from the 5th Avenue skyscrapers! I am coming back here but this time with family too. Everything is nice about this place!"
3,Rooms really need to be gutted.,"Stale and dated would be the two first words that come to mind when I walked into my room. Service in this hotel is excellent, but the rooms, while functional with four walls and a bathroom DO NOT represent the Four Seasons brand.The property is beautifully positioned on the river, and in a bandaid approach they have put new tile in the showers and large TV's in the rooms, but OMG the rooms suck.Given the price point, if you want something new and fresh head a block down the street to the JW Marriott. My friend was staying there while I was at the Four Seasons and I quickly offered to swap him rooms.Trio Restaurant is decent and the lobby bar is also good. Both offer happy hour specials, but other than that I won't be here again unless I see the rooms have been fully remodeled."
5,Excellent service; physical plant needs upgrading,"Service is superb, consistent with what I have come to expect from the Four Seasons. The concierge provided -- via Twitter -- excellent restaurant recommendations prior to our arrival. When we checked in, the receptionist gave us a warm welcome and advice on sightseeing (it was my first time in Austin. I tweeted about the hotel before my arrival, and on our first night, we received a chocolate ""thanks for tweeting"" at turndown - wonderful. When I asked for a taxi, the doorman gave us access to the hotel car. In short, the staff is world-class.As others have noted, in terms of improvement, the main issue - admittedly a challenge - is the physical plant. The exterior of the hotel is a bit drab, and it does not match the astronomically high level of service. The guest rooms, while perfectly fine, could be larger and more luxurious (given the rising standards of rooms throughout the industry). The pool is not at the level one would expect for such a property; it could be bigger, surrounded by nicer landscaping, and infinity edge, for example. But this would all obviously require major renovations and investment, so it might not be feasible.In any event, overall this is an excellent hotel, and I would certainly return."
5,Fabulous stay at Four Seasons,"This hotel is superb for both business and pleasure. It has gorgeous grounds on the lake that are more like a resort than a city hotel, with accompanying restaurants and drink service on the beautiful grounds facing the water. The spa and gym are top notch, and the rooms are serene and comfortable for both working on the laptop between nearby downtown meetings, as well as relaxing."
5,Harmon-Samson Wedding Weekend,The Four Seasons Austin was a fabulous location for our wedding group! We had over 100 guest rooms for up to 4 nights and our guests were extremely happy with the property and their staff! Great job to the Concierge Team and the Meetings & Events Team for making our events flawless!
5,Austin Four Seasons,Very clean with beautiful room and groundsHighly professional staff who were also friendlyLocated close to great restaurantsOnly issue was cellphone service not conectig in hotel room- very unusual
3,Not four seasons quality,"Having stayed at many four seasons resorts/hotels over the past 20+ years, I would say that this is not one of their best hotels. The location is good as it is right on the river. Service was good, but rooms are not up to four seasons standards and the pool area needs to be completely revamped."
5,Wonderful Hotel and Spa,"I come to the Four Seasons once a year for a conference and it is always wonderful. Rooms are nice, always sparkling clean, and the staff hotel-wide always knows you by name and goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Their spa is one of my favorite I've ever been to. I think amenities-wise, it is probably just average, but the staff there are amazing. The best deep tissue massage you can get anywhere. Every single time. They have a nice pool and a running trail right by the lake. And the pool bar makes some delicious mojitos :)"
2,Four Seasons Austin a Disappointment,"This is a very dated property and lacks the typical aesthetics and service level of a Four Seasons hotel. The furnishings are dated, the bar area is loud and service is poor, and overall guest service at the hotel and the Spa is lacking/not up to par with top-tier luxury hotel standards. Very disappointing."
5,top-notch,This hotel has recently been renovated to great effect. The experience there has always been a good one and now it's even better. The hotel offers free wi-fi as well as faster wi-fi for a fee. The free wi-fi was more than adequate for streaming.
5,Perfection!,We stayed 2 nights at the Four Seasons in Austin. Everything was lovely for my twin 5 year old girls and me. We enjoyed walking around downtown when we weren't playing in the pool or relaxing on the beautiful lawn overlooking Lady Bird Lake. The service was impeccable; our room was perfect; the restaurant was first class. I hated to leave!
5,Wise Choice,Everything detail of this hotel is excellence from the bell boy down to the maid service. This hotel makes you feel important and is willing to go the extra mile to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.
4,"Great location, but just an ""ok"" resort","If it were not for the fantastic location of this Four Seasons, I would have given it just three stars. My husband and I stayed here Memorial Day Weekend. We wanted a resort located along Ladybird Lake within easy walking distance to all of downtown.The location cannot be beat, especially if you enjoy walking or any type of water sport. We walked about six miles down the river walk one day and rented a tandem kayak from Congress Avenue Kayaks located right behind the Four Seasons the next. The river walk is full of hikers, joggers, bikers and dog walkers. Very nice and easy. Ladybird Lake itself is calm and a great place for beginner kayakers or paddle boarders.We were able to walk all the way down Congress Avenue to the Capital Building and back, all down 6th, etc. We comfortably walked to both Second restaurant on Congress and Second, and Perlas down South Congress.The staff here is what you would expect from a Four Seasons. Overly friendly, extremely helpful and very prompt.The main downfall of this hotel is that it does not seem to know that it is a Four Seasons. For $1000 a night I expect things that can be easily controlled to be perfect. While our room was nice, our ""city view"" was a view of a parking garage roof, complete with an old pillow and garbage that sat there the entire weekend. There were stains all over the pull out sofa in our room (we only used it as a sofa and not a bed). Also, the bathrooms are very basic and dull. They do send a nice welcoming note and serve complimentary beers and chips and salsa, but I honestly would just have preferred a cleaner couch :-)While most of the room service was pretty good, a pizza we ordered was literally the worst pizza I have ever tasted in my life. I didn't complain, and I wish I had. I just left the entire pizza on the room service cart.As for TRIO, my husband and I found the Sunday brunch to be just ok. I would have actually have preferred to order breakfast ala carte, but our server never even came back to ask us how everything was until it was time to hand us the check. The people sitting next to us actually chose to leave because the cushions at all the tables were filthy. In fact, all of the cushions are old and filthy. They have stains all over them. The staff needs to replace the cushions or at least be wiping them down or washing them! Also, I understand the patio is outside and that there are birds, but that is no excuse for how dirty our table was or all the bird droppings on the patio wall next to us. Hire someone to clean constantly. That is what people are expecting at a Four Seasons.Lastly, the pool was not at all what we were expecting. I mean, from pictures, we expected it to be small. We did not expect to see all the dirty towels and plastic cups all over the chairs and pool deck. It was a mess when we got there and a mess when we left. Again, teach your staff to be diligent about cleaning up. It is what is expected of the Four Seasons brand."
4,"Great Location, Excellent Service, Small, Overpriced Rooms","We have stayed here many times, and the service is uniformly excellent. Right on the lake, the south facing guest rooms have great views. The lounge and bar area tend to be a bit loud and buzzy, but fine if you're in a party mood. The pool area and the grounds are nice. The problem is that they keep raising the room rates, which are now at a point that they're out of line in an increasingly competitive Austin hotel market."
5,Business travel in Austin,"Terrific hotel. Great location, amazing staff, gym and spa upgrade is awesome, and access to Lady Bird Lake for those who like to run outside is terrific. If you stay here more than once, the staff do an outstanding job of getting to know you personally and go the extra mile to make your stay outstanding. Cannot recommend this hotel enough."
5,I want to go back to Austin stay at Four Seasons again!,"The Four Seasons in Austin was so great that I want to visit Austin again - this time with the entire family - so I can stay there again. Being on the running trail; having an awesome fitness area; nice pool area; comfortable rooms - I told my wife I wanted to extend our trip. Unfortunately work was too busy for me to do that, but I will be back!"
4,About what you'd expect,This was my 2nd stay at the hotel the last time being over 10 years previous. We had a professional meeting here. The facilities and breakfast for the meeting were pretty good. However the outdoor sound and microphone was inadequate. Re room service: I called after completing my meal and asked for someone to pickup the table and dishes. No one came so I had to put it outside myself. This seems to be a common problem in many hotels.However I'd like to end on a positive note: high marks to housekeeping and the lobby staff. It's a great overall atmosphere.
3,Pool very Plain. Disappointing!!!,"Hotel is very nice, Walked in and received a glass of champagne at check in That was really nice. Decided to go to the pool to relax. For a Four Seasons Hotel we were expecting a gorgeous pool. Not at all gorgeous in fact worse than a apartment pool. Tried to get passed the ugly pool, but then got to the pool about 10 minutes before 6 and was told we could no longer get drinks at the pool. Major bummer. Overall, hotel is very nice but only one pool and it was super disappointing. If you are coming to this hotel for a relaxing time at the pool don't stay here."
5,Best hotel for every need in Austin,"The staff is FANTASTIC, accommodating and always the best. The view is phenomenal. The pool and spa are the best in downtown. Food is great. Easy access to everything downtown. We go once a month - sometimes business, sometimes family fun, sometime both. They are great for all of it."
5,Heaven on the River,"From check-in to check-out, this is a superb hotel. Beautiful ambiance; friendly and efficient staff. The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfy. Even the bell captain went the extra mile to spends talking about his favorite restaurants and pointing us in the right direction for what we wanted. This is definitely THE place to stay."
5,Service and location,"This hotel was great, balconies on some rooms with an amazing view, extremely clean, walking distance to many restaurants and shops, all staff were incredible and helpful. Clean, comfortable. Spa was great, gym area really new. Highly recommend this property. Thank you for the great stay."
5,Wedding Weekend,Our son got married in Austin Texas . Our first choice in a venue for the rehearsal dinner was The Four Seasons - Austin. We have stayed at numerous Four Seasons and know that their standard of service is excellent. They were so helpful and very easy to work with. They made for a very enjoyable weekend for all!
3,Extra charges,Upon checkout we occurred extra charges that were not ours and no staff can provide any details why they are there or signatures to justify they are even mine? I have contacted twice by e-mail with no results.
5,Anderson Adios,The location was conveniently located. We were there for a wedding and it was gorgeous. We were able to walk to restaurants. The staff was very friendly. There was many things to do close to the hotel.
5,Oasis in the middle of the city,"Fell in love with the grounds of the hotel..The lake, the walking path, the outside sitting area. Would come back to Austin just to stay at the Four Seasons! The location was perfect and close to everything Austin had to offer!"
5,Four Seasons Austin,"Better than Ritz Carlton and most other luxury hotels I've stayed at. Their location is particularly nice, bordering on the Colorado River aka Lake Lady Bird. The landscaping is magnificent and the restaurant was so good I dined their every night of my 4 night stay."
4,Typical Four Seasons,"It's obviously a great chain. Nice property in a good riverside location with a view of the Congress St. Bridge. The bar has great cocktail selections. The pool could use additional staff as it is hard to tell what lounge chairs are in use because no one is picking up the towels. The hotel lacks nothing, it's just not the greatest in the hotel group."
5,superior in every way,"There has been explosive growth in the number of hotels Downtown but we continue to return to the 4 Seasons.While it is very close to the Convention Center it retains an element of exclusivity and has an unparalleled location when it comes to the property itself, backing up toTown lake with it's boating options and trails.The hotel itself will be undergoing extensive renovations over the summer but is by no means dated with very comfortable rooms, excellent bed and bath linen, a wonderful bar and excellent restaurant (Trio).Service is understated but outstanding.Prices a little higher than other options but given overall quality worth every penny.."
4,The Three Seasons?,"My business associates asked where I was staying in Austin. I replied that I was staying at the Four Seasons. They called it ""The Three Seasons"" because they didn't think it was good for a Four Seasons. Sniff sniff!! All I know is that the concierge was exceptionally helpful (getting a charger adapter at 11 pm), the bar was fun, the room was very clean and while we weren't talking 600 thread Egyptian sheets, it was solid. Good experience and location. Aloha!!"
5,Great Stay in Austin,"Hotel stay was wonderful. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the Lake. Hotel is conveniently located and walking distance to bars and restaurants. Loved the trail around the lake for biking or jogging. Four seasons knows how to treat their guests - would stay again. Only negative is rooms seemed ""tired"" could use a good update."
5,Highly Recommend Four Seasons Austin,"This hotel and staff exceeded my expectations. Attention to detail, professionalism, and excellent customer service were obvious and very much appreciated. Looking forward to going back and bringing my family."
5,Favorite Hotel,This is by far the best hotel I stay in and I travel about 20 weeks a year. George at the front entrance is the most welcoming person every time I see him. Thanks Four Season Austin. You are always one step ahead of me during my stays.
2,5 Night Stay,"The staff and concierge was rude to many members of our party. They attempted to overcharge on items that we did not purchase and made us jump through hoops to have these items removed from the bill. The prices were much more expensive than one would expect for a hotel in Austin. The property was well maintained and aesthetically pleasing, but the trip was ultimately ruined by the unfriendly staff."
3,Nice but dated,"Service is the best aspect. Does not have the most modern look at all. However, the customer service is well above average. The location is ideal and walking distance to a lot of restaurants. Wish they would renovate, Beds are excellent."
5,Fantastic Four Seasons in Austin with Facelift!,"Although one of our favorite hotels, it was getting a bit tired. Well, that is all history as everything has been re-done for a great result. It is a strange thing but Texas with all of the historical oil wealth has very few world class hotels. The Four Seasons Austin is one of them. The staff is fantastic. The gym is now world class. The guacamole is almost as good as that of the author and the locations is the place to be."
5,An extraordinary facility-the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin,"I attended a meeting of women leaders here. Everything about the hotel, the staff, the accommodations, the food, the lounge experience, was wonderful. From the time I was greeted by the valet until the time I left, the service was gracious and timely. The front desk staff and the staff in the lounge were particularly notable for their superior service. The housekeeper was thorough, polite and inobtrusive."
5,The Friendliest Four Seasons,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Austin for five days and I wish I could have stayed five more! Beautiful outdoor spaces, a great new gym, and truly some of the most helpful staff I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with. They did everything to make my stay comfortable (Owen at the front desk - thanks for the tips about Austin!).The rooms are a bit small and dark, but the bed was extremely comfortable. I wonder how I can get that mattress topper - it's like sleeping on a cloud. Location is fantastic - close to everything downtown but still peaceful. Overall, highly recommended. I am looking forward to my next stay."
5,Love the Four Seasons in Austin!,"Great Location on Lake Austin with the Running trail and Lake right out the back of the Hotel. SPA staff is very good the Staff in general is very responsive as well as very helpful with just about any request. Love the restaurant, TRIO as the food, service and atmosphere is excellent. Before or after dinner enjoy the Bar upstairs which is very cool. If you haven't stayed here yet you should! I do all the time and Love it!"
5,A Cut Above the Rest!,"We LOVE the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin because they strive to make your stay exceptional. My husband had forgotten his dress socks and the boutique in the lobby had already closed and the very, very nice concierge opened the store for us and allowed us to purchase dress socks after hours. That was very much appreciated and the kind of service that makes the Four Seasons stand out above all of the other hotels."
5,Four Seasons - Austin,"Love this hotel, what a fantastic location and the Pura Vida Tequila margarita called Tres Hombres is the best! Not a better hotel in town. Both the city view and the lake view rooms are great, always a god time to be had at this hotel and especially in their bar."
5,Can't get any better,The Austin Four Season has been great every time I have stayed there. Best hotel in the city. Everything from the curbside checkin to cleanliness of the rooms are excellent. The staff is welcoming to everyone !
5,Always a great experience,"Fantastic Guest Service. The Four Seasons has the best beds and pillows at any hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff is outstanding, and the overall experience was wonderful. Can't wait to stay again."
5,Business Conference,Close to conference center. Walking distance to resturants shopping etc. Clean hotel with great staff and service. The food was excellent. Had a wonderful trip and experience at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin.
5,Great Weekend in Austin,"We were in Austin for a family wedding but came into town a day early to relax, which was a great idea. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Location, rooms, service, food were all great. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Awesome Hotel - Location, Service, Amenities and Atmosphere are all Top Notch","Awesome Hotel - Location, Service, Amenities and Atmosphere are all Top Notch. All Four Seasons are special places but the Austin location is among the best. Food options are excellent and the staff is extra friendly.Location is easy walking distance to 4th St and 6th Street"
4,Excellent hotel stay,"Excellent service, with a Great Lakeside view. Front desk personnel including Abby were super nice and helpful. Parking valets were awesome. Def take advantage of free morning coffee until 9am or so in the lobby.Typical Four Seasons level of service everywhere although the restaurant is not quite up to the same level. See my review of trio below:Excellent restaurant! For dinner the Caesar salad was ok, dressing was a bit sweet for my taste. The popovers with asiago cheese were so good. I don't do a lot do bread but couldn't resist.We had the velasso salmon and the red fish. Both were really good, red fish a bit better both cooked perfectly. The Brussel sprouts were really good as were the home cut fries.For dessert the canolini ice cream was maybe the best I've ever had. Had chunks of fruit and chocolate chips.The only thing keeping this from a higher rating was the service. The waitress was really nice and tried really hard. She just had too many tables to give the high level of service the Four seasons is known for.We also experienced the same issue at breakfast. We both had the hippie omelettes w excellent hash browns. All cooked perfectly but servers just spread too thin."
1,"Terrible Service, never going back","This review is of the restaurant and not the hotel.There is an old saying, 'The higher the store, the lower the score' and seems to apply perfectly to the restaurant in this highly reputed hotel.We've been going there for breakfast and lunch every time we visit Austin and over the years the service has continued to decline. Yesterday was the worst experience we've had at any so-called 'high end' eatery.We wanted a quick drink and a snack as we had movie tickets for a show at the Alamo Drafthouse where you are denied entry if you are late. We ordered three drinks which included an iced-tea and two smoothies. We told our waiter we were in a rush. He said no problems, would take care of it.After forty five minutes and multiple pleas to all the wait-staff passing by, including our own waiter our smoothies arrived but still no drinks. Meanwhile our neighboring tables had already been served their entrees, even those who had been seated after us.Waited another ten minutes and were about to go in and cancel the drinks order when they arrived, the waiter apologizing that the bar was too busy. We had to gulp them down, and sent two of our party off early to the theater. Since our waiter had disappeared we asked another one to take our check for payment along with my credit card. I had even put down a 20% tip after all this as I accepted the waiter's explanation that the bar was busy.However, we waited another ten minutes and there was nobody coming back with our credit card and we could not see our waiter. We were sitting on the outside patio and thought perhaps the restaurant inside was full - the outside area was less than half full at this time and there were plenty of waiters around.After this time I was really upset and walked inside and asked for the manager. I noted now that the bar was almost empty and so was the restaurant with only a few people. The manager arrived and I explained how terrible the service was and now our credit card had disappeared and we were really getting late for the movie.She promised to look into it, but never came back. Three more minutes of waiting and our own waiter returned with the final check and our credit card, again saying he was sorry for the delay. I told him 'sorry is not acceptable' and signed the check. Needless to say I left no tip at all.We then ran to the theater without stopping at our hotel room on the way to freshen up and just made it to the movie.This is about the worst experience we've had at any high-end restaurant anywhere in the world. There was no lack of wait-staff and the waiter lied about the bar and the restaurant being too busy. If that was truly the case the other patrons should also have received their orders late, but they got them before us even though they had arrived later. I cannot believe two smoothies and three drinks should take over an hour, especially when we had repeatedly said we were in a rush.The attitude was so cavalier and the final straw was our credit card and check disappearing with our waiter who later continued to take orders from new arrivals without bothering to follow up on our card. Only when the manager intervened did he return. The manager too did not return to apologize for the fiasco.Definitely never going back again."
5,Above and Beyond,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Austin for our wedding weekend (ceremony and reception at a different location). Every touch was excellent, the staff went over every detail for all of our guests, and they went above and beyond welcoming us as a couple. The personal attention, excellent food and wonderful ambiance made the experience better than we could have hoped. 100% recommend, you will not be disappointed!"
5,The BEST!,"There is no better place to stay than the Four Seasons. PERIOD. They have the nicest staff, most comfortable rooms, and best amenities of any hotel I have ever stayed in. If you are traveling to a destination that has a Four Seasons go ahead and book your room now."
5,Wonderful 25th wedding anniversary,Everything was awesome! We stayed for our 25th anniversary and enjoyed every minute. Great view from the balcony. Awesome walk around Lady Bird and into the 'old' part of town that looks so different than it did 25 years ago. Went to Uchi for dinner and then walked to the Bob Marley festival after. We've very lucky to have so much going on in Austin and to have this great hotel and staff!
5,Four Seasons Austin Top Notch,"Lovely understated property with immaculate, friendly service and a fine Manhattan in the bar/lounge. The adjoining grounds are peaceful and there is a perfect running path along the water.Too bad there's nothing fun to do in Austin (ha!!)"
2,Not impressed!,"I recently spent four days at the Four Seasons and I'm not sure why reviews are as good as they are. As far as the condition of the hotel (especially the pool) it is far below four seasons standards. The grounds out back looking over the lake are nice but you can see that without paying $800/night to stay there. 'Great Service' often associated with Four Seasons was spotty. I had some typical experiences and some not-so-typical. I found food/beverage service in the lounge and pool tremendously lacking (almost missed a meeting begging for someone to please get me my check). I also had an extremely uncomfortable experience with one of the people servicing my room. She entered the room (without announcing herself) while I was going to the bathroom (door wasn't closed). When I yelled that I was in my room she said ""I know"" and continued into the room. I hid behind the wall and yelled ""What are you doing"" as she was standing in my room looking into the bathroom. She disregarded my requests for her to leave, walked into my room saying ""sorry"" she needed her vacuum. I also had an issue at checkout. I wouldn't recommend staying here, would probably stay at the W or JW Marriott next time around and maybe just have dinner at the Four Seasons out on the lawn."
4,Excellent Service,"The hotel is unimpressive in terms of approach and curbside appeal, but it is very nice once you get inside, and the grounds behind the hotel are also very nice. The staff is excellent - friendly, professional, helpful. I don't often notice the quality of housekeeping services because they tend to be fairly standard, but the housekeeping services at this hotel went above and beyond in small but meaningful ways."
5,Beautiful hotel with incredible service,"This is a beautiful hotel, located in the heart of Austin. We loved our room looking over the lake. The restaurants in the hotel are the best. The hostess Janel, is the nicest lady to greet you. We love the backyard with hammocks and tables on the lawn, and path along the waterfront. Great workout in the gym. We will definitely be back to this hotel."
5,"location is great, but so is everything else","location is great, but so is everything else the workout room is small but has everything a small business center allows for a nice work space the hotel is right on the lake trail--location can't be beat and the coffee machine and apples by the desk are superb"
4,Great Hotel,"We held a meeting at the hotel and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves and loved the hotel. Great location, rooms, service. I rated it very good instead of excellent because of some scheduling issues with meeting rooms. Otherwise everything was perfect and the staff was wonderful."
5,Excellent hotel and service,Beautiful hotel. Staff came to me rescue when I needed help with a business appointment. Food very good. The surroundings of the hotel are beautiful. Rooms very comfortable. Overall a brilliant hotel.
5,Short stay,Even if I stayed at Four Seasons Hotel in Austin for one night I could see the great service at the front desk and the friendliness of the staff during breakfast. It was a great experience that makes me think on my next visit here!
5,great stay,great stay at this high end hotel. location was excellent and everything was in walking distance. staff was especially friendly and professional. Would certainly stay again is the price is right. Certainly not a budget hotel.
5,The nicest hotel in Austin hands down!,"Just top of the line, in every regard. The rooms are impeccable. I've stayed many times for both work and leisure, and each experience is delightful. I prefer to stay exclusively at the Four Seasons when in Austin. My only regret this past visit was it was all business and there was no time for spa and pool, which are always a treat!"
5,Very nice hotel whether business or leisure,From the moment I arrived until I checked out I was always treated extremely well. All the employees were friendly and eager to assist. They provided recommendations for dining and entertainment and one employee overhead me talking about going for a run and brought me a jogging trail map for that area. Amenities were very nice. I was pleased.
5,nice setting,"fun bar area, hotel sits on beautiful property by river and very close to downtown. great stay. would stay again for sure. hotel staff were great. had meeting here and that was very easy and great facility. Food was excellent."
5,Great Stay,"We always enjoy staying at Four Seasons hotels. We know we can count on extremely courteous, competent and friendly service, very nice guest rooms, and delicious food - both in the restaurant and through room service. Having the beverage station at the check-in/check-out desk is wonderful as is having the valet drivers offer a bottle of water for your drive back home."
4,Wonderful location along the riverfront; great service as you would expect at a 5 star hotel,"Great restaurants and the Austin bar scene are all walkable, as is the downtown business area, but at this hotel you can watch kayaks go by from your window, sit by fire pits or the pool, or stroll along the river. The rooms are not as luxurious as some other Four Seasons, but they are very nice. The music in the bar each night lured us in for a couple of drinks, which made for a very pleasant evening."
5,Had another great visit,"Love the location of this property--right on the water. This past visit, the weather could not have been more perfect, and I had a wonderful lunch outside in the Trio restaurant, looking out toward the lake. There was a cool breeze in the air, the birds were singing in the tall trees, it was fun to watch the joggers and bikers on the path and the food was very good. I always get a lake view room and never get tired of watching the bats come our of the Congress Bridge at dusk. I always make my dinner reservations after their expected flight. The front desk and the concierge are always very helpful. The hotel is starting to upgrade their rooms, and I am anxious to see how they turn out."
5,Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons,"The 4 day meeting was well run, the meeting rooms were NOT freezing, the breakfasts and cocktail parties had better than average food, staff was abundant and pleasant. I would recommend this place for any meeting or family and friends get together."
5,Luxury staycation,"It's the Four Seasons! It's everything you would expect but with Austin laid back vibe and close to so many fun things. Of course the rooms are nice, staff more than accommodating, spa fantastic and the restaurant TRIOmg is so much better than most hotel restaurants. After a night of imbibing a bit too much, the Sunday brunch buffet is a God send! I know, I know, buffet? Boo! Um no, they manage to make it feel intimate. No long lines at omelet stations, they'll bring you one. They'll bring you anything! And it includes all your mimosas and now bloody Mary's!!Some of the waitstaff have been there for over 20 years! Says a lot about the company. Special thanks to manager Nancy who manages to find a table for me when I plan poorly! I am an Austinite and the Four Seasons is my happy place!"
5,Highest Quality,The Four Seasons Austin was one of the best hotels we ever stayed. Staff at the front desk were extremely helpful. So were the concierge staff. Room cleaning was excellent and they helped for each problem. Location of the hotel is perfect to go down the river and watch the bats.
5,April at Four Seasons,"Concierge was extremely helpful, made multiple reservations and had terrific follow up. The room was perfect for work trip with plenty of space and all the necessary amenities. Definitely will visit again."
5,Business at the Capitol,"We were at the Four Seasons Austin for business. From the moment we arrived everything was excellent. From valet parking, to check-in and out and final valet as we drove off. Food for our event was wonderful! Especially enjoyed the coffee which was fresh and hot! A lot of places serve lukewarm coffee, a no no. Service was excellent and attentive. We will definitely be back."
3,The trip,"I always stay at this particular Four Seasons, but I was a little surprised that there was no acknowledgement of their room service worker tripping over my 8 year old son and landing in top of him in our room. My son cried and was given a shake. They did send risk management to the room with an ice pack. It just would have been nice if they had given him a little attention when we checked out the next day."
5,Bumped to the Four Seasons,"It was after midnight and the hotel I had a reservation at called to say they had given away my room. That was immediately followed by, ""we've booked you for the evening at the Four Season, Austin."" From the time I pulled up until the time I left it was an excellent experience. The room accommodations were so wonderful and comfortable!"
5,Luxury!,"While our room was rather small it provided a comfortable sleeping experience. However, with the outdoor areas and area recreation we were hardly in our room. Located right on the river with grounds that offered comfortable seating areas in the shade, we were totally relaxed. Excellent fitness center, nice pool with very attentive staff. Just a great experience. Be sure to visit the little coffee shop down the hill by the pool where you can sit outside and watch the rowing!"
5,Love the Four Seasons - Everywhere,We choose the Four Seasons when we can. We have attended meetings at Four Seasons Hotels all over the country and in Canada and we always have an excellent experience. The staff is always wonderful. The hotels are so quiet (even in Las Vegas) that a good night's sleep is assured. Rooms are made-up in a very timely fashion. Restaurants are excellent but it is hard to resist at least one in room dining experience.
5,A great stay in great location,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons Austin. Wonderful location along the lake, with the walking trail out the door. Swimming pool and other amenities were first class. We certainly recommend this property for a stay in Austin"
5,Our home away from home,My family and I love this hotel. We stay for business and with family for special occasions. The location next to lady bird lake and close to town makes it especially attractive. We stay here 5 times per year.
4,A disappointing experience,"I have stayed in this hotel for 15 years and have even had a wedding here. Unfortunately, this trip was not up to par...the rooms need updating and there was no service by the pool this hot and sunny March afternoon...college kids throwing beer cans is not a relaxing 4Seasons experience! Once the hotel was advised, they did do everything they could to accommodate the guests...we also requested the hotel car to take us to a 5:30 dinner reservation and had to wait 20 minutes for the car...the hotel just seemed off this weekend much to our disappointment"
5,Excellent Stay,"This is a great location and the staff was amazing. My daughter wanted to stay in for the evening, so we ordered just about everything on the room service menu. All of the food was great and the staff was very helpful."
5,Birthday stay,We celebrated a birthday while in town for a wedding. Four seasons came through again. Nice relaxing weekend. Nice touch with the chocolates and champagne in the room! Wait staff were all courteous and accommodating. Totally well worth it; and we are looking forward to our next stay in Miami.
5,Exquisite hotel on Town Lake,"Beautiful views, great spa, restaurant and service. Best in Austin. Always a pleasure to spend time, Great paths around the Lake. Thrilling to see the bats come out from under Congress Avenue Bridge at dusk."
