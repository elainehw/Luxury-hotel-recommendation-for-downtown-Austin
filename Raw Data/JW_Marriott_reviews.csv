5,Luxurious,"If you are looking for a posh, comfortable, luxurious hotel in Austin, this is your place. The rooms are beautiful (my favorite feature were the geode sconces in the bathroom) and the staff were friendly and accommodating."
5,Easy to understand why they are #1 !!,"#4,152 to review - that is incredible!Wedding weekend. Host hotel. The best it gets. My sorority sisters and I were in a room and we had such a blast. Why we loved it:*Outstanding Concierge level - the best we've ever seen. Welcoming staff and great food. We only made it for the breakfasts and the homemade salsa is worth the trip alone! Lots of cubby hole areas with TVs. Super nice staff. The COOKIES at the Concierge Level are addictive. Beware!*Stunning hotel with so many food & beverage options. The Corner Bar has an outdoor seating area. Slammed when we arrived on Thursday.*The best fitness center of any hotel - very large, high end equipment and very clean. no excuse for not visiting. Especially after eating tacos and drinking great cocktails at the bar!*Starbucks on the 2nd level - convenient and much needed.*Helpful staff: needed a place to run in the morning and the front desk representative gave me the best place: crossed the bridge, down by the river - gravel path - perfect!Would definitely choose to stay here on any return trips to Austin!"
5,Defines a great hotel for business,This hotel is my favorites corporate destination. The location is great for all my Austin needs. The gym is in the top 10 of Bob Voy gyms I’ve been to and the lounge makes for a perfect perk for elite members. I look forward to stays in this hotel
5,Amazing location!,Was visit for a business event. It was a great stay. Perfect location close to many restaurants in the downtown area. Also utilized the conference rooms for a few meetings and the staff was very accommodating.
5,Great experience,"Everything you need in one place, greet service at check in made you feel welcome and appreciated they were thankful for you staying there. Starbucks on second level was a big plus. Food and service was excellent in the in house restaurants to the catering in the conference rooms."
5,Favorite Hotel in Austin,"Great location, beautiful and spacious rooms, great amenities, and great food. In the warmer weather, the pool is a nice spot to sit out with a drink, and I highly recommend the restaurant connected to the lobby “Corner.”"
5,A very nice hotel!,I stayed somewhere else the first night and was not impressed. The next two nights of my trip were spent in the JW Marriott Austin. I felt much more relieved and impressed from the moment my taxi dropped me off. The lobby and amenities were beautiful and my room was awesome! Very well decorated and luxurious. I will stay at any JW now that I got to experience this one. Great job!
4,hotel sold out due to Conference and room was quiet,"I attended a conference that was located at this hotel. Though sold out, my room was quiet and I didnt have to wait long for an elevator. I had a fridge in the room which was convenient. I loved using the robes provided to the guests!"
5,"Great location, great venue","Great full service venue within very short walking distance of attractions, bat bridge, 6th street bars, and the capital. Great concierge lounge and good restaurants to choose from on the property. Also a great meeting venue for small, medium, and very large meetings."
5,Beautiful and functional,Everything was excellent. The room was spotless. The WiFi was strong. The TV was very nice. Rooms are very spacious. The bed was so soft I just sank in. The pillows were so fluffy! Loved it. Highly recommended.
5,Great hotel ideally located,Great renovated hotel located 3 blocks from the Convention Center. The many restaurants and services make it an ideal place to stay for business. The staff was particularly attentive to the different needs of the business traveler.
4,Disappointing ellipticals and touchscreens,"Had to try 3 ellipticals before could find one that workedLeft step was wonky and unstable on first, second one no audio and touchscreen unresponsive, third touchscreen inconsistent. Talked to other gym goers who had same problems but also noted faulty audio and touchscreens on bikes and treadmills too. very frustrating and substandard for Marriott"
5,Great stay in Austin,"From the minute we checked in the entire stay was outstanding. At the front desk Lily was very helpful and quickly helped us get sorted out. The room was very clean, good size, and a great view. All the facilities and amenities were first class. Highly recommend staying here."
4,Girls Trip 2019 great location,This was a great hotel for our annual girls trip. Centrally located and great atmosphere. Everyone we encountered was very helpful and went out of their way to make our stay great. Overall great place to stay and I know I would stay here again.
5,GC Awards Review,"Love this hotel and the location. You could walk to a lot of restaurants and clubs. The staff was helpful and friendly. My room was clean and comfortable. In-room dining was good, Corner service was a little slow, however the servers were friendly."
5,Exemplary Staff at JW Marriott Austin,"I recently stayed at the JW Marriott in Austin for a conference and was very impressed with the facility and most importantly the professionalism, friendliness and dedication of the staff. Everyone I dealt with was welcoming and helpful. I would like to especially call out the manager of the Corner restaurant - Sarah Bryant - who went beyond the call of duty to make sure that I could get one last amazing Salmon dinner to take with me to the airport. She did not hesitate to accommodate my special needs and her efforts were very much appreciated."
5,A great Stay thanks to Manager Jenna and team!,"I must admit, my initial experience for this stay did not start off well...As has happened to me in the past, I was promised (via my Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite Membership) a complimentary Suite upgrade for my stay. Why this ""benefit"" is presented is beyond me as it quite honestly never works out that way and often leaves me with a sense of frustration and under appreciation as a ""valued member"". Given the difficulty I incurred online in booking a room this way I called in the Marriott Bonvoy Customer Service line and was given the ""run around"" multiple times. What made matters even worse was that the Bonvoy staff continued to insist that it was ultimately in the hands of the hotel. When I contacted the hotel, the reps blamed the Bonvoy Customer Service and the way the promotion was set up. This was obviously very frustrating to me as a underappreciated Titanium Elite Member.This is where Jenna (the Front Desk Manager) stepped in and made something happen for us. While she ultimately was not able to grant me the Suite Upgrade I was in search of, she did her best to come up with a viable and reasonable option for me and my family. She handled my frustrations with a extremely genuine concern and compassion. She made me feel understood and appreciated. I was very impressed.Ultimately, Jenna presented me and my family with a ""Hospitality Suite"" and an adjoining King Bed Room. She even followed up with a wonderful personal touch of a handwritten note and bottle of wine. Jenna's efforts certainly helped to right any booking wrongs that I perceived and allowed me and my family to have a wonderful stay. Thanks to Jenna I can say we will certainly be back!Sincerely,John Nestor"
5,Marriott Austin in November 2019,"The new Receptionists were not aware of parking options, but their day shift associates were empowered to correct the disparity at checkout! Great call by Managment! Thank you. I believe this is a local protocol only!"
5,November Weekend,"Lobby bar was excellent and the Corner Bar has a great outdoor patio and vibe.We spent time by the pool inn Sat, and had tremendous service even though it was a bit cool outside.The pool deck is extensive as it wraps around the corner of the hotel. The pool itself is not resort style, but is well laid out with private cabanas and seating.The gym is outstanding with plenty of room and tons of options of machines and free weights. I did not personally use the spa, but the ladies in our group did, and enjoyed their services.The concierge lounge was as expected, roomy, great choices, and well taken care of by staff.Overall, a five star review for sure."
5,Modern digs,"Very nice building with modern accents and up to date gym equipment. The lobby is nice for getting together for a drink near the fire. Corner and OP we’re both good restaurants and both convenient. The gym was well maintained and has free apples! Room service was professional and timely. Overall, a great stay close to the convention center."
3,Hotel,"Everything was nice but they didn't clean our room and we came to the room late at night, after a wedding and the trash was not emptied, there was no coffee, water, cups, toilet paper or towels. I called several times and the desk kept saying they were going to send someone but nobody came. Later a lady came with coffee only. I called again and then grabbed a worker that was walking down the hall. He finally got us what we needed but it was after 11:30 pm by this point. I did not have a sign on the door and as we left that afternoon for the wedding I told the lady cleaning the room next to me that our room was ready to be cleaned."
5,JW Marriott Austin knows how to do service!,"I have traveled alot this past year, the people really do make or ""break"" a place. The customer service here was outstanding. Every staff member I looked at smiled! If I needed help or looked like I did, the help was there. Lots of things to do and places within walking distance. Thank You!!!"
4,Great overall convention hotel,"I stayed at the JW Marriott Austin for the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) Annual Conference, which turned out to be a positive experience overall other than the extremely salty food at the 11/8/19 In-House Counsel/Partners Dinner at the hotel, my malfunctioning room safe, clogged room toilet, and low sink/shower water pressure (I did not report this latter problem). Hotel staff was quick to fix the malfunctioning safe and toilet, and I appreciated the complimentary beverage voucher the hotel offered me at the Starbucks pop-up within the hotel (on Fl. 2) for my troubles."
1,"Old, nasty","ItS an awful experience. Manager received me with no hospitality skills, never offered option to solve a problem. The property is old and filthy. In addition is expensive and has no options to eat. Never go please."
4,Love this hotel not happy with housekeeping,Housekeeping is poor to non-existent. Did not get our room cleaned the first day and the second day the job was half done. Did not take and replace dirty classes and the room was not that neat....bed was made but sloppily.We love JW's and it is our preferred hotel when we travel.
5,Outstanding!,Felt welcome from the minute I walked in. Greeted and checked in immediately. Was walked to the elevator. Great guest service. The food was also excellent and very reasonably priced for a hotel. Staff was super pleasant at all times! Highly recommend this Marriott
5,Exactly what you expect from a JW Marriott,"This hotel is a beautiful building fully loaded with amenities in an excellent location. The lobby bar has a warm, cozy feel with a beautiful natural gas sculpture/heater in the center of the room. The service was friendly, fast, and competent, and the hotel has a prime location for many of Austin's best sites. Our visit was exceptional.We stayed on the 33rd floor which had amazing views of Austin. The elevators are quite fast and fortunately skip over many of the interior floors. Be ready to have your ears pop though. We visited in November so we didn't use the pool, nor did we have time to use the exercise room.Ice is on the 5th floor which at first was a little annoying when you're situated on the 33rd but then I learned you can just pop by off the elevator on your way up and grab a plastic bag of ice from the freezer to take with you so you don't have to take your bucket all the way down and then back up.They have a nice happy hour deal at their restaurant OP italian with really amazing calamari. Starbucks is on the 2nd floor for coffee needs."
5,Traceller,Michelle in the lobby bar is an all-star. Her knowledge of her craft combined with her incredible personality and conversational prowess is second to none. I would follow her anywhere! Incredibly friendly and accommodating.
5,Business teip,"The JW Marriott was nothing short of amazing. We stayed on the 14th floor and the view was amazing. The staff was very nice and accommodating from check in to check out. The hotel was clean, warm, and inviting."
1,"No Sleep, Just Blasting Music From Pool, Including Weeknights","Avoid this hotel like the plague if you like to sleep or relax. It blasts music from its pool deck around two nights a week including weeknights when you may want to actually sleep and get ready for work. Managers don't care as I was told ""it's a private event and there's nothing we can do about it"". Literally it's in their hotel and ""there's nothing they can do about it"". The photos is from a rager on a SUNDAY NIGHT."
4,We enjoyed this hotel!,My husband came for business and I joined a day later. The room was comfortable and clean with a nice bathroom. The lobby is quite large and he enjoyed the restaurants and we had good room service food as well. There is a nice bar area on the roof by the pool that has fantastic views of Captiol and the river on the other side. You can see the bats sometimes at sunset during the time of year they are around. Staff was great and i would not hesitate to stay here again.
5,Excellent help,Had special function in the Presidential Suites. The problem was a key to the room was needed to operate the elevator. Paula/others were helpful to enable us to get to the function and maintain security.
5,Comfortable stay,Here for business trip upgraded to nice corner room on high floor. Very courteous front desk and concierge. Gym was well equipped and all machines worked. Only negative was slow service in Italian restaurant
5,Austin at November,"We stayed at the JW this November. The room was very quiet, and very clean. It is what i expected. Wonderful place to stay. It is especially convenient to active downtown's activities. It is an easy walk or a ride to all the necessary places."
1,"Beware of ""Suites"" here","I used my Suite Upgrade here and was docked 4 nights for a totally average room. They didn't even have a refrigerator in the room. I was told because there was a king bed and a view on a high floor that that was a considered a suite. B-O-L-O-G-N-A! Also, I dropped my laundry off day 1 and was told it would be back at 6pm that night. It was not in my room when I got home late that night, so I called in the morning asking for it. They told me they were sending it right up and when the bellboy arrived all he had was bottled water. Turned out my laundry was not ready yet. I did not have any clean underware or socks so that sucked. They waived the charge on my laundry, but still WTF? I will not stay here again and would advise anyone else to steer clear!"
5,Wonderful hotel,"Great location, 5-star rooms, very modern. Great access to all of downtown, easy in and out access to the airport, about a $20 Uber/Lyft ride. Good meeting areas, very spacious. Conference rooms and food were top-notch."
4,Review,"This is an excellent hotel in a great location. I have a few suggestions for improvement:1) The elevators are a hassle. Everyone had trouble with the key cards trying to get the green light to come on. That system is a royal pain, especially when you have luggage, when the elevator is crowded, etc. Moreover, the elevator door closed very quickly and hard on me one time, hurting my shoulder.2) The front desk folks were not necessarily customer service oriented. Rather, it seemed like the people we dealt with there were simply trying to process us as quickly as possible ... never made eye contact, didn't explain anything about the hotel, etc. For such an exclusive and expensive property, it seems like the front desk staff should be a bit more welcoming and service oriented."
5,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of Downtown Austin,"Everything about our stay was perfect. Check in was a most pleasant experience, our room was lovely, spotless, well laid out, and quiet. The executive lounge was the ""perfect"" J W Marriott experience, and the gym had all the equipment and machines one could ask for. Parking was very convenient. Everyone so helpful."
5,Central to downtown Austin,"Centrally located on East 2nd Street, this property was convenient, gorgeous and comfortable. The rooms were lovely! I had views of the city skyline and the river. The staff were exemplary and accommodating. I ate at the Corner restaurant and it was delicious. This hotel is close to many restaurants with local flavor as well."
5,Excellent Hotel!,"The hotel is lovely but, most importantly, the staff are warm, welcoming and very helpful! The hotel restaurants serve delicious food. Also, the hotel is well-situated close to restaurants and other shops."
5,JW Marriott Austin,JW Austin is centrally located in downtown. Customer Service fron start to end is always top notch . The restaurant managers & staff are always friendly and provide excellent service. Always my first recommendation to friends and family.
5,Downtown stay SLC,My stay in Salt Lake City was made even more enjoyable by the facilities and staff. Sara at the front desk went above and beyond to make me feel welcomed and appreciated. The rooms were great and the bed and pillows were wonderful’
5,rev,"All around excellent service, response, clean. Prices for food, though are exorbitant even by San Francisco standards! Conference staff well trained but again, costs of equipment, etc. really high. Not sure how many groups can afford this place even tho it is excellent"
2,So many disappointments,"Can at check-in did a great job. I asked questions about our stay he could not answer, like where our meeting room was. It took several conversations before we finally found out, more conversations to get access to it, etc. I was supposed to have breakfast vouchers, which took till the last minute to finally get, and only after repeated conversations. It appeared that people in management did not inform the people actually delivering the services. Both breakfasts, the server accepted my hotel-issued voucher and said they would have to check with their manager. An over-priced box lunch marked “gluten-free” included a cookie and pasta salad that were not gluten-free (only the sandwich bread was). The room was standard for a conference hotel. So many unnecessary frustrations and disappointments."
2,Asked for an easy favor and they would not oblige.,"I traveled for a conference. The corporate rate was $299/night. When I went on to my Bonvoy app, the rate was @ $239. When I asked if I could have that rate when I checked in, they refused. As a good elite member, I thought my request was reasonable. I’m disappointed."
5,Fantastic hotel,"Loved this hotel - the public spaces were sleek but cozy, modern but accommodating.The bathroom was spacious and the shower head was strong.The room was clean and huge with great views.No complaints. Just perfect."
4,Nice but received a lot of service recovery,"A few days before my trip I called and added Saturday night. When checking in the person I’d spoken with had made a note. There was no room assigned/available. The reception person had to make three trips to some back room and assigned me an accessible room. She apologized for the delays and gave me a $10 credit to any restaurant on the property. The room was ok, although the hand held shower head had no pressure. We also had no refrigerator. They sent a person with a fridge and then a maintenance person. The maintenance person said the regular shower head was missing but there wasn’t anything he could do about the pressure, “it’s just how it is.” We called the front desk to see about a different room and was told all the bellmen were tied up until one pm. No one came. We mentioned this and a card with a $30 food voucher-good until the next day was delivered in an envelope with an apology note. Our observation-spend more time on the service and details and you won’t have to do as much service recovery. The elevator to the parking garage smelled like sewer-dumpster for the entire stay (4 nights). The food in OP was great. The food for our meetings was great. We were comfortable."
5,Perfect location for an Austin Weekend Away,"Overall excellent, a busy weekend at this hotel, however services and quality of the staff and property were consistently above average. A very convenient location for taking in plenty of great food and entertainment nearby."
5,Lovely,Great location and excellent view. Rooms are good. Staff are helpful. Ambience is great. Easy to walk to the Bat Bridge and to nightlife. Easy access to touristy locations. Highly recommend it for location and ambiance.
5,Great Weekend Getaway,Location is perfect and service is always outstanding. Easy walking distance to so many food and entertainment options makes this property our go to when we come to Austin. We will continue to return to the JW Marriott whenever we come back to Austin.
5,Gorgeous hotel - roof top pool /bar,"Very cool hotel with excellent staff, spacious lobby with bar & roof top pool/ bar that overlooks the city. Zero depth pool was very Miami- chic.Room rate was a bit pricey despite the group rate. Next day the rate dropped by $150 so not so happy about that."
5,Comfortable Conference Experience,"We stayed at the JW Marriot for a conference being held in Austin. I found the hotel very clean and well staffed. Any request we had, they were ready and so willing to help fulfill it. I have to say that the staff here were truly exceptional. They were extremely kind and very welcoming. Our housekeeping team was wonderful in helping provide extra towels and toiletries when requested. The rooftop pool was a lovely little oasis. And having a Starbucks in the hotel was very convenient for early morning coffee runs. Overall, I would highly recommend staying here if traveling to the area."
2,Tough time to stay at a premier Marriott,The television did not work and the drain in the tub was broken so my entire shower of water was left in the tub when I finished. To finish it off I never received a receipt on my email to be reimbursed. JW Marriott is supposed to be one of the premier Marriott properties. I was extremely unimpressed. I travel a lot and it's the little things that impress. Things you don't have to think about. Like TV and showers. Thanks.
4,JW Marriott,This is a very large and busy hotel. We are Platinum Elite members and were treated as such. Still hotel staff is very accommodating. Executive lounge is one of the best in the US. Staff was great. Gym is amazing for a hotel. Elevators are surprisingly quick. Greta location.
5,Nice Property,"My overall stay was nice. The room was comfortable. The TV didn't have many options and the viewing was spotty. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I did not eat at the hotel restaurants, however, there are many options for food close by."
5,"Beautiful hotel, clean and excellent staff",Only downside was on the day we left the pool area and executive lounge were closed for a private function. We were a little disappointed after receiving such excellent service that we had no communication from the hotel about this point or advance notice.
5,Trip,"Had a very nice stay. The only thing I had issues with, cell connection was extremely poor when I was inside the building, specially in my room (21st floor). It was hard to keep cell conversation with my clients. Using wi-fi calling was worst, so that's not an option for your customers."
2,Really poor experience,"Noise from other room was loud and we complained to the front desk and nothing was done to stop the noise. We were asked if we wanted war plugs. That’s not an acceptable solution. We ordered room service and the brownie dessert was not baked through. It was raw in the middle and not warm or good. The bathrooms in the convention areas were filthy. The layout of the bathroom in our room was inconvenient. For the price and level of hotel, we were shocked that this was a worse experience than mid-level hotel."
3,JW Marriott Austin failed to meet my expectations,"I'll start with the pros: the restaurants at the hotel were excellent with diverse food choices and attentive wait staff. The hotel is very clean and attractive in appearance. The pool/rooftop area is very enjoyable. Now the cons: upon check-in we experienced an unfortunate communication breakdown which resulted in mistakenly being placed on the ""no housekeeping"" list. It took two days to fix that particular error. Also, upon check-in we were told our reserved room wasn't available and my spouse and I could have a two queen room for our ""guaranteed"" price; however, for an extra $40/night we could have a king bed room with a view (and no housekeeping service for two days). The mattress was extremely hard and getting a good night's sleep was impossible. We had to ask for firmer pillows as the initial pillows were extremely thin and provided no neck support. The toiletries were very drying to the skin and hair. I was excited about staying at a JW but I'm over it now."
5,Amazing Property,The best location and service in Austin. Having stayed at other downtown locations I must say this place and the staff are the best! The executive lounge and amenities for Bonvoy platinum members was an added plus. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a business or leisure place to stay in Austin.
4,Great location,"Had a nice stay. The hotel lounge is a happening place, good drinks as well as snack food. The housekeeping could be better, sometimes they did not refill the tea, cups or used glasses. Everything else was great."
5,I Keep Coming Back,3rd Stay here. Greatly appreciate everything this hotel has to offer. Perfectly designed rooms. Incredible Food and Drinks.Had the pleasure of dining at OP and was blown away. Amazing team working there. Will be back as always.
5,Well located and great service!,"The JW Marriott is well positioned in the heart of down town with excellent service before, during and at checkout. There was a lot going on, but my room was quiet, clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
4,Mostly great with a few hiccups,"Bed- wonderful! Pillows- terrible. Even changed from feather to foam, but still not much support.Location- exceptional!Housekeeping- something was wrong every day: no coffee service refill; towels hung to save water were replaced anyway; remote control didn't work well; room not vacuumed; no pen or paper at phone. Calls to front desk remedied issues, so thumbs up for that.5th floor outdoor area was so relaxing, even if not swimming,Scooters, bikes, ubers right outside door made for easy transportation.Highly recommend two restaurants right outside the side door- Cooper's BBQ and Burger Bar."
4,Strong Choice,I like the central location most. It’s easy to get the live music in both areas. I didn’t have to get into a vehicle the entire trip other than airport transfers.The property is lively with a great lobby atmosphere. It tempts you to stay on the property to eat rather than going out to the great establishments in the area. We will stay there on our next visit.
5,This hotel was gorgeous!!,I wish I could have stayed in the hotel the entire time. The hotel bar had every drink I could think of and was a hotspot of beautiful people! Every staff member I encountered was both polite and helpful.
5,Great property,"Very friendly staff, clean property, location is excellent. I was on the 34th floor, could hear music from the nearby restaurants/bars, I was a bit disappointed in the Concierge Lounge.. doesn't have some of the offerings of other properties, Marriott Legacy is one of the best I have experienced, thought this being a JW would be at least equivalent. One other comment on the lounge, all tv;s were set to cnn or msnbc.. not sure why, local tv is better than the vitriol that those networks report. no tv remote insight so that I could either change station or turn off."
5,Great Hotel,"I loved the JW Marriott in Austin. I had a great time in Austin, and everyone in the hotel was very courteous and friendly at all times. Any time I had a question they were very helpful. The property is gorgeous, with great views from all rooms. The meals were excellent, and everything about my stay was perfect."
5,"JW Marriott Austin, TX","Great location, friendliest staff I have ever met, rooms were very good, the rooms were cleaned very well each day and they gave us fresh towels everyday. Great visit. Lobby was very nice for hanging out. Could use more areas where you can plug in your laptop and set it down on a table and work on it. A lot of places to sit, but not a lot of plugs. The bed and pillows were super comfortable!"
5,5 night stay in Austin TX,"great location, quick check in and check out, easy access to self park garage, room cleaning service saw that we had bottled beverages and brought up a fridge without us asking for one. lobby bar was consistently busy."
4,Accommodated all my requests!!,"I had requested a bathtub in advance and didn’t get one. I asked for a new room and they immediate switched me to a tub room. They brought me a mini fridge, a steamer and answered all my texts right away! Exceptional service!"
5,BEST LOCATION,"This hotel provides the highest quality comfort, luxury and access in downtown Austin. The service was excellent, with staff at every turn of the facilities PROACTIVELY looking to offer you help - it was interesting how quickly there will be someone to ask you ""what can i help you with, this is the way to the conference, this is...It is also place in the close proximity to Rainey Street, 6th Street and the Lady Bird Lake. This means you have an ideal running/walking trail to stay fit, then access to a vibrant entertainment scene and the cozy comfort of the hotel to relax and recharge."
5,What a friendly staff and modern hotel!,"It’s our biannual national conference and I’m glad it’s in Austin and in Marriott. The lobby staff welcomed me even before I can get to the check in line. Because I’m a member they asked if I need late check out. They upgraded my room without me asking for it. The gentleman who checked me in even walked me to the elevator with my luggage. Basically, they’re proactive in making me feel welcome! My room had a wonderful view and I like this a lot. I like the firm bed but all 4 pillows are too soft. I need a firmer pillow for my neck:) Although I was out most of the day for my conference, I wish they had more channels with movies or shows without ads. The lobby bar served good drinks. It’s openness and location is very welcoming to meet up with my colleagues. I also enjoyed the kale/squash salad with adobo chicken for lunch at their restaurant. The hotel location is close to many restaurants, bars and music. Very walkable and convenient since I didn’t rent a car. I wish I had more time to go to the pool and spa. Next time!!"
5,Best of Austin,"Great job by all the staff. Fantastic from front desk to room staff. Everything clean, tidy and well cared for. Had fab delivered no issue. Needed fridge in room, sent right up. Had issue with the heat blowing cold air. 64 in room and 48 outside is chilly for Texas. HVAC mech couldnt fix it, called boss up, solution in 5 minutes. Great teamwork. Thanks again"
4,Excellent hotel. Maybe too popular.,The bar was so crowded for 3 consecutive nights that it was not a pleasant experience. Great for hotel. Not necessarily for guests. When I stay at a JW Marriott I should be able to find a seat and get served a drink.
5,Nice property. Great Location Amazing staff,In terms of size the rooms are average but very well appointed. The bathroom lighting is odd as most of the light is overhead or behind you as you face the mirror. The shower is great but could use a spray wand.The staff is incredible! The attention to lines at check in is unbelievable. there were a few people ahead of us in in the check in line. Out of nowhere an extremely polite man offered to help and checked us in . Our room was ready before the promised check in time which seemed unusual for a property this nice.
4,Very good in every aspect,"Good value for money, very friendly and efficient personnel even taking into account the size and full occupancy of the hotel. Rooms are very comfortable with a very good bed. Also personnnel in restaurants were friendly"
5,Great trip,"The service aspect of this trip was fantastic! Rooms are clean and quiet. The food in the restaurants was well done. Room service was the best. The area of town was dirty, congested, and full of homeless people."
5,ACOEP Conference,Staff was very friendly and helpful. They made you feel special. Staff met us in the lobby and escorted us to the desk and then to the elevators. The staff answered all of our questions that we had. We had a great time.
4,Austin JW,"Nice, big, busy hotel. Somewhat impersonal overall. Lots of dining options locally. Hospitality staff great. Rooms for conference were great. Nice support overall. WiFi average. Television service was ok though some channels had poor server feed. The key cards only worked some of the time. We had to get replacement cards to get through 4 days. Nice pool area. On scale of 1-10 would give overall 7.5. Next year for another work related business meeting at the Austin convention center we will likely stay at a smaller, more personalized service hotel in the area."
4,A small city within a hotel...,"Stayed at the JW Marriott with some girlfriends while a big conference was taking place at the hotel. There was plenty of action, an upscale vibe, and the hotel felt like a small city with its many bars, restaurants, hip atmosphere, and awesome pool area with live music in the evenings. The standard rooms and bathroom were a little on the small side and we wish that there would have been an in-room refrigerator. Would stay here again."
4,"Fabulous stay, great location","Came here for a conference. The hotel staff were incredibly responsive and helpful from the moment I walked in. We had a number of client-related tasks and events and each time the organization and attention to detail meant what we needed to be done went without a hitch.The room is lovely, views pretty impressive and shower nice and powerful :)Weirdly, in a city riddled with coffee houses and artisanal everything, the coffee was truly truly awful. No milk or half and half. Just 'creamer'. I feel like they could come up with a deal with local coffee makers to improve this. It may be small but its a significant gap in an otherwise flawless experience."
5,Here for business & would come back for vaca in a heartbeat!,"I can't say enough about the wonderful team of red coats, caterers, managers, food service, front desk folks (to name a few) -- thanks for making nonprofit arts educators feel just as welcome as Formula 1 racers."
3,Missed the mark,"Has lots of potential, but for the price I wasn’t blown away. Digital key didn’t work, couldn’t get on internet for awhile. Found someone else’s hair in my bathtub, the shower bar was very loose and janky. A nice piece of art was hung sideways. Breakfast menu that you must fill out, but no pen. Just lots of little things"
5,Great Details,"From the selection of bars to the elegant customer service to the lovely details in the room, my stay was just about perfect. Loved the lighting in the bathroom and the geode lamps. Also appreciated the window that took up an entire wall in my room. It was a great way to enjoy the Austin skyline!"
1,Complete lack of respect and response.,"I wrote a lengthy note to express disappointment on my day of arrival. I asked for a manager to contact me. I had a medical prescription that needed refrigeration that was poorly handled. I had to dispose of it, causing an inconvenience that can’t be put in words. Still, no response from management."
4,Conference stat,"The JW is a nice and shiny space with great staff right in the heart of Austin. I was there for three nights at a conference and have few complaints. Next to the elevator, my room was noisier than I would have liked, so my suggestion would be to avoid rooms ending in 16 or bring earplugs. I also found the water pressure lacking, but a colleague thought it was fine. Food, both in room and in the corner restaurant, was quite good. All in all it was a good stay and a place you could count on for the same."
5,Excellent service,Very nice hotel - close to a lot of the musical venues and only about 7 tenths of a mile from the state capitol building. Had the best service I've ever had at any hotel I've attended a conference at.
5,JW Marriott Austin Stay,"This is a top notch hotel. The staff was professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. The room was very comfortable, and the gym was top of the line. The conference hosted at the hotel was flawless."
5,Incredible stay in Austin!,"Everything was perfect. The housekeepers are second to none. I have stayed in a lot of hotels but this stay, I have to say, is one of my best ever. I will definitely consider when traveling in the future!"
5,Community Music Trip,Impressed with every portion of the service.You treated me with respect and kindness.Hotel staff stayed out of the way but was also accessible.Things like wi fi and tv were a little difficult to navigate at firstBathrooms like a personal spaThank you!
5,Great option for Austin,Had a great experience at the Marriott during a recent business trip. Staff was friendly and professional and the rooms were well kept. Multiple food options are available which include full service bar. Work out facilities were clean. The pool looked nice but didn't get a chance to go for a swim.
5,The spa facial was excellent,"The service and location at this conference friendly hotel made for a great stay. The bartender in the veranda bar was extremely pleasant, serving healthy happy hour offerings and reasonable wines. The spa hydra facial was a win!"
5,Great place for work and fun!,"Everything from the staff to the restaurants, the gym, room service, location and the city of Austin was amazing! Will definitely be back! I was in town for a conference at the convention center and the walk was a quick two blocks."
5,Best in Austin,"I came to Austin for a conference and had the opportunity to stay at the JWMarriott Austin.The staff, from the front desk to the bar, were awesome. I’ve had so many stays at other places where I felt I was having to play catch up to get the things I needed during a stay, but the folks at JKMA seemed to anticipate my needs.Thank you to all of the fine folks at JWMarriott. I know that I’ll be coming back when I next visit Austin."
4,"Exceptional Service, Decent Property","I recently stayed at the JW Marriott for a wedding held nearby. The bridge and groom selected this property for their guests. While a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite, I've seen a range of Marriott properties and while some amenities felt wanting at some points, the service was truly exceptional. I immediately called Marriott to convey my appreciation for the team here who helped to make my stay and my family's stay exceptional.This is a large property, well situated downtown. With so many restaurants and bars, it feels more like a casino on the Las Vegas strip than a standard JW Marriott. All of the venues were nice, with excellent service and professional, friendly, and intelligent staff.Where the hotel could do better would be in updating some of the rooms, which felt a bit staid and tired. No word edges, mind you, but the decor and functionality is a bit lacking when compared to even some of the lower end Marriott brands like Aloft and Moxy. The pool was disappointing, too. We rented a cabana and while the service was great the pool itself was short and shallow resulting in a few unwanted sunburns. It was a bit overhyped for what it was.The one amenity I will praise was the gym. Beautiful and plentiful equipment with a great view to boot.Again, service made up for any shortcomings in amenities and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend on that alone."
2,Not up to JW standards,"For a luxury brand this hotel misses it mark in many areas. It’s a large property hosting many events at the same time. I found the staff to be cold and in some cases rude. Most staff seems to be Eastern European and comes off rude.The facility itself is nothing special. Rooms are standard and lack many of the amenities of a luxury brand. The rooms are dark especially the bathroom.Hot water seems to be scarce. After taking a cold shower I called down to the desk and was told that there must be a high demand for hot water and it’s taxing the system. Really? I had the same problem at 130am while preparing for bed. How many people are showering at this hour?On Saturday night the hotel was crazy busy. At 1 am a group of drunken people were banging on the doors on my floor. A call to security rang for minutes until it was answered and placed on hold. After a few minutes of music someone finally picked up. Thank god it wasn’t a medical emergency.I could go on and discuss the terrible food, lack of a properly stocked lobby market and many other issues. As a business traveler and coordinator of travel services I can not recommend this hotel. A good alternative-would be the Hyatt or Hilton located a couple blocks away."
5,Expensive but full service hotel,"Was here for a convention and the services and amenities are very nice, high quality. Housekeeping staff is especially attentive. Front desk and concierge great with special needs. Plan to pay for parking, however."
5,Planview Conference,"I enjoyed my stay, the staff was very professional. There was an issue with lost luggage at the airport being delivered, the airport confirmed delivery but the bellhop didn't receive it. The manager working the front desk stayed on top of it until it was resolved."
5,Yom Kippur Chabad YJP,Every aspect of the event coordination and execution was done professionally and 100%.The staff came forward regarding all of our specifications for our event and hospitality and accommodated our religious preferences with respect and dignity.
4,"Great hotel, great spot and what you expect...","Stayed whilst at a conference and have to say it was a great place to be...perfect spot in downtown Austin...short walk to Capitol building...cool pool and bar to enjoy some rays, great gym and spa to relax in....conference areas were as you would expect, but good layout and lots of light...if I was staying on holiday I may not appreciate the 000’s of people in my hotel, so would be worth checking that out, but still big enough to cope!"
5,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful, modern hotel. Every time we asked for anything they replied with “we will take care of it.” And they did! Very friendly and professional staff. Absolutely beautiful rooms. Huge windows in the rooms. Fun rooftop pool with a bar and fire pits and games. Great for a posh girls’ weekend away!"
5,Excellent Experience,"My time and stay at the JW Marriott Austin was amazing. I appreciate the wonderful dining, awesome customer service and excellent housekeeping. I can't wait to return the JW Marriott Austin, the location is perfect."
5,JW Marriott Survey,Great property and excellent service. I forgot my jewelry and the process to have it sent back was vey simple. I was just surprosed it was turned in. I've left things in hotels before and never gotten them back.
5,Business trip,Beautiful hotel. Was there for a conference. The room was normal hotel room. The food was good and the location was great. The only issue I had was the makeup mirror did not light up and it was expensive
4,Really nice but I expected a little more,"Don't get me wrong, this hotel is very nice. The lobby and conference facilities were great. The service was really good, from the time I checked in to the time I checked out. I even had an interaction with maintenance due to a TV not working and the gentleman was nice, timely, and courteous. The only area where I recommend an improvement is to the rooms themselves. Don't get me wrong, the room is very nice, however being that this is a JW Marriott (one of Marriott's ""luxury"" brands), I expected more. There was nothing special about the room, it was just simply a nice hotel room. I've honestly stayed in nicer rooms, for considerable less money, branded under the Marriott or even Westin hotels. I was also disappointed in the television service which didn't allow you to connect to your Netflix or Hulu accounts.Finally, the valet fee was ridiculous - $49 per day."
5,Another Terrific Experience at the JW Austin,I have now stayed at this JW about 4 or 5 times. This one was for a conference for my company. The staff from the first moment I arrived showed care and excellence. The room was spacious and comfortable. The conference experience was well done and the food was excellent.
5,Fabulous location for a business conference!,"This property is a fabulous location for a business conference. The conference center is spacious and comfortable. The food service is excellent and the food is delicious. For eating on your own, there are great options on the property, including room service."
5,Almost Perfect,"Every JWM employee I interacted with was gifted with service and smarts. The property was well cared for and the food was prepared and served by people who cared about the experience.The room was clean and wonderfully appointed with Austin fun-for-the-eyes accessories. Good access to power ports.Loved the bathroom, except the vanity lighting. Pretty does not make effective in this case. Just try putting on make-up on in there! Please improve the vanity lighting ..!"
1,Not run like most JW,We checked in and the room was not ready so they said they would let us know when it was ready! They let us know so we checked out of waiting and went over only to find out it was not ready! Finally we get a room and it Smells like mold! I let them know they don’t change the air filter and say they can’t move us anywhere. Go downstairs and talk to the lady at the front desk and they have another room that we can switch into second room front door does not work and the TV does not work never fixed the
2,Not a good experience,"Arrived to room to find an old bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the floor, not a big deal but for the price of the room should not have happened. Went to the front desk, they gave us a voucher for the restaurant, Theresa in the Corner Restaurant is the best thing about this property hands down. Second day I opened the curtains and looked down, and there were lip marks and hand prints all over the lower part of the windows, there was hair and crumbs on the ledge I called down and asked for someone to come up, housekeeping manager came, saw, wiped off and gave us a voucher for the restaurant and money off our nightly rate. Went to use the voucher for breakfast, ordered eggs Benedict and flat iron steak and eggs. The whites on the poached eggs were still runny, the waitress was arguing that that is the way they are supposed to be and kept saying “you want hard poached” no such thing, just wanted the whites cooked with a runny center which she could not understand. The steak was rare, ordered a medium steak,,blood all over the plate, spoke to manager, she offered to have other plates made, with a 100% fail rate the first time, I didn’t want to give it another try. Later that day we asked to speak with the General Manager, Blake said he would get “him” a young woman comes out listens and says “we are not holding you hostage here, you are more than welcome to find another hotel”. This could have been a wonderful hotel stay had the room been inspected after it was cleaned, clearly it was not. At first glance everything looks good, but the rooms really need a little updating and deep cleaning. The bathroom vanity is rusted, the toilet paper holders are squeaky, you can even hear them from other floors/rooms. Dark spots on carpet, throw pillow on chair, the fabric is pilling. Management just seems to throw money at the problems, I just wanted a nice worry free stay at what is supposed to be a very nice hotel. Giving us money to use at a restaurant or reduction in room rate does not fix the problem, if you keep throwing money at guests instead of fixing the root problems, your gonna run out of money and guests to throw it at. Just wish it was perfect from the moment of check in, it wasn’t and money won’t fix the bad experience. One last thing, the room keys, had to go back to the desk many times because the keys did not work for the elevator."
5,Excellent 2nd Experience,"This is my second time staying at JW Marriott in Austin, TX. Again, I was blown away by the attention to detail and willingness to constantly provide excellence service. My most memorable experience was the service and genuine conversations by Justin and Mike at the Edge roof top bar. It made my trip very enjoyable and I will be back again because of the entire JW Marriott team.Thank you!"
4,Enjoyable stay,"The hotel provided everything I enjoy when traveling for business. A nice gym with lots of training options, pool, room service, quiet room, attentive service, and a clean hotel. Overall I enjoyed my stay very much."
4,Downtown Austin Cornered!,"Pretty much the center of the social universe in downtown Austin for travelers and residents alike. Excellent service overall. The casual eateries are fun but you have to work to get anything healthy. The fine dining OP Italian restaurant is best avoided. Standard rooms fall short with THE WORST lighting I've ever seen in the bathrooms, plus sparse furnishings. Saddest beat-up refrigerators (available only on request). Parking charges are crazy high, but the valet operation is efficient, careful and courteous."
5,Great location and service,Just came back from an amazing family vacation at this wonderful hotel. Loved the hotel with all its amenities and location. Would definitely consider visiting again. Definitely recommend families with kids to give this hotel a shot
5,"Clean, comfortable, and close by","Excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Rooms clean and spacious, with modern styling, and furniture. Beds comfortable, and an excellent shower with plenty of water flow to help you relax. Had a nice view of the river from my 9th floor room too. Short walk to the bridge to see the bats, and Cooper's BBQ is on the same block, so bring your appetite! Also at at the hotel's OP Italian restaurant, and it was very good and not very expensive."
5,Phenomenal hotel with amazing staff,"JW Marriotts continue to set the bar for exceptional service and this location is no different. Felt welcomed from the moment we arrived till we left, we enjoyed every aspect of this hotel. The pool was crowded but great and offered a wonderful view of the city. Our room was spotless, spacious, and extremely comfortable. As I mentioned, the staff was great and was there any time we needed anything. I would gladly stay at this hotel again as it was one of the best overall experiences I have had travelling to date."
5,5* all the way,"This is a very very nice hotel. The rooms are clean and very nice. The beds and pillows are awesome and very comfortable. My room on 29th floor was great and quiet and had a great view. The bars and restaurants have very good food and staff is great. Some servers tend to not be very attentive during the evening but late night staff is right on!. Hotel is in a great spot, close to everything you want to see and do. one complaint was the food at the banquet rooms, but thats a small minus. The biggest plus is the staff at the front desk. They come out to greet you and will do anything to ensure you are happy. Really great hotel. Great stay. highly recommend it."
5,"Excellent Hotel, but Pricey","I had a very enjoyable two night stay at the JW Marriott Austin. This was my first trip to Austin and the hotel was well situated to visit many of the city's sights (Capital Building, 6th Street, South Congress, etc). My room was on the 30th floor with an amazing view of Lady Bird Lake and the city. The shower was spacious and thankfully the controls were situated on the opposite wall from the showerhead!The JW's facilities are fantastic, including pool and gym. I have never seen a hotel gym equipped with a full squat rack before and made sure to use it. However, It's somewhat annoying to access the pool on weekends. I was asked for my room key, room number, and wristband on a Saturday. Apparently many people try to sneak-in off the street, so I suppose these measures are necessary. On Sunday, no wristbands were needed, The pool is a decent size, but due to the crowds, it's more for standing around with a drink, than actually swimming.The only downside is that the JW is pretty pricey. Rates seemed comparable to a hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Breakfast in the Corner restaurant was quite good. All the staff I encountered were kind and helpful. I would definitely return!"
5,Beautiful Hotel with Lovely Staff,"I can’t say enough good things about my stay. I was there from 9/29-10/2 for a local conference. The hotel is beautiful! The location is great to walk to local restaurant and shops. The hotel has a beautiful rooftop pool and bar. There is a spa, fitness facility and two great restaurants to choose from.I truly have not met a nicer staff next to staying at Disney World. Everyone was so proactive and greeted guests upon arrival. Every interaction felt personal, from the front desk, waitstaff and housekeeping. If you are planning a trip to Austin, I highly recommend this hotel."
5,Fantastic hotel with exceptional customer service,I was so impressed with this hotel during my recent stay for a business conference. The lobby was gorgeous and my room was luxurious. I can’t say enough about how nice my room was. I thought it must be new construction because everything looked so fresh. The pool is gorgeous and I had a lovely time speaking with the bartender. I hope to be able to stay here again on a vacation.
5,austin,I did not know why I did not get any points in my stay I gave my card number and It happen all the time .I think is unfare that I go in a business meeting and do no get points . This is not the first time .I am a member of Marriott . The point is that I am staying i just get the points
5,"Great hotel, ok service","Check in experience was not great. No mention of my platinum elite status, did not ask whether I wanted points or other welcome gift, no mention of room upgrade and would not look into my request of using my company rate.Room was great. Large bathroom with luxury stand up showerHad to call and complain twice about the room next to me for noise around noon. I acknowledge the hotel compensated me for this.Low floor, definitely not worth the money spent. Will choose a different hotel for my next Austin visit"
4,Nice location!,"This hotel was in a great location for us. It is very clean, has nice decor and very comfortable beds & pillows. The roof top area has a great pool and bar,My big con was that we requested a rollaway bed and when we arrived at 3:00am due to flight delays thats when they told me. The front desk offered no solution other than i'm sorry you weren't told. You don't ask for a rollaway unless you need one and it can make for some uncomfortable accommodations without it. The lack of communication and ability to rectify the situation is a problem for me."
5,"Huge, nice location and views","Stayed here for 3 nights for business. The hotel was big and full of amenities. So many restaurants, bars, and a spa. Only thing is that the Starbucks on the 2nd level was understaffed around 8am weekdays. There was a convention and even though the meetings provided coffee and breakfast, the line for Starbucks was extremely long. Only one person was working at the time. 3 or 4 people could have easily managed the crowd.My 2 queen corner room was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was luxurious with the shower and roomy countertops. Finally a real bathroom rug, not a towel. Massive windows on two walls gave me fantastic views over the rooftop pool, lake, downtown etc. There was loud music in the evenings that I could hear on the 18th floor, but it stopped at a reasonable time.I would return for sure."
5,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location!","Walking distance to great restaurants, bars & shopping! Located right near the river which has a wonderful path which is great for a nice walk or run! The pool area is also very wonderful and relaxing with great views. Had a great lunch while enjoying the beautiful weather poolside."
5,Love JW,"I absolutely love JW hotels, always in great locations and with the best staff.If you're planning for a stress free vacations or a work trip environment you should consider JW as your best option for the trip"
5,Great Hotel and Staff,"I came to the JW for a conference and the hotel was a great location and the staff were great! JW has great options for restaurants, it's very spacious and the rooms were clean. Definitely will visit again for business or personal!"
4,Great location in Austin!,"Stayed here for some personal time and some business, 5 nights. Unfortunately the King Room I reserved was not available, so they game me a 2 Queen room. Staff is friendly, food is good, plenty of dining choices, nice pool area with Cabana rentals. Facilities are clean and well maintained. Only CON: I stayed on the 6th floor. 24/7, there was a mechanical clanking/grinding noise coming from under my room(the 5th floor). I told the front desk staff about it twice, never resolved. That's rough when your trying to catch up on sleep from a 2 time zone change! Overall, a very nice property."
5,Premier Customer Service! 🤩,I traveled to Austin for a conference and the JW Marriott was exceptional! I had great service from the moment I checked in until I left. Would most definitely recommend for a casual stay or Conference venue.
5,If I Could Give Ten out of Five Stars I Would,"I stayed here with a friend overnight for my birthday and then for a conference. They brought up a microwave and fridge for no extra charge, brought me a nice birthday surprise and even a Starbucks gift certificate when our coffee pot went on the blink. They were very attentive at check in and anytime we had a question and there was barely a moment before we were attended to at the front desk even though there were multiple conferences going. I love the Marriott brand to begin with, but their service was second to none.The rooftop pool on floor five was also very relaxing and a great place to stay after the conference for a couple of hours while I waited for my plane to leave.All in all, a great trip staying in the heart of downtown just a few blocks from 6th street."
5,"Clean, Friendly, Perfect Location","This was a great hotel. The JW Marriott Austin supplied everything I needed to rate a hotel 5 star - they had WONDERFUL customer service, clean rooms, clean facilities and fabulous food. The rooftop bar and pool is a great place to relax, when you aren't in a business meeting or exploring the awesome city around. I highly recommend!! I felt like I was in my ""apartment"" rather than a hotel."
3,Good hotel great staff,This hotel is in a great location. We had some hiccups with our room which the staff tried to accommodate. The service is quick.Restaurants are okay - over priced for the quality of food. I suggest eating off campus.
4,Not ADA,"Bonvoy member attending conference. Upon check-in a 2:00A, was assigned an accessible room, that was not requested. After notifying front desk, they immediately assigned a different room. Why wasn’t this my original assignment? Why wasn’t I told in the lobby, so that changes were made before moving upstairs."
3,Bad experience with mobile app on otherwise good stay,"The location and rooms were fine, but the mobile app was frustrating. I used the mobile check-in feature on the Marriott app and was informed that I would receive notification when my room was ready and would be delivered a mobile key. After arriving at the hotel, and waiting in the lobby for over 2 hours while waiting for my mobile update, I noticed that it appeared that everyone going to the desk was being issued room keys. I then waited in the line to ask an agent directly when I might be receiving my notification and electronic key from the app. The agent told me that rooms were available, and that they did not yet offer electronic keys! The app being inaccurate caused me a lost 2 hours and it would have been more had I not become impatient enough to go to the desk. More frustrating was that the person at the service desk blew it off like it was no big deal. I suggested that she report the issue so others don't have to go through the same frustration, but from her body language and the fact that she took no notes I'd be surprised if any additional action was taken."
5,Austin Weekend Conference,"Bustling hotel in the heart of downtown Austin close enough to walk to many of Austin's great reataurants, bars and entertainment. Clean, comofortable room and surprinsigly quite and restful sleep. Can be a bit pricey depending on the time of the year but a good place to stay for luxurious comfort and convenient location."
5,Game Day stay,"Very clean, updated property. Great place to stay on football game day. Location was perfect to walk to tons of bars and restaurants. I ate dinner at the Star restaurant, which was fabulous, and I had drinks at the bar, which were great as well. I would definitely stay here again."
4,Excellent stay,"The Marriot is in the center of town, on Congress Avenue just a couple of blocks from the river. The room was spotless although I was surprised it did not have a refrigerator. Lots of towels and amenities. I arrived after a night flight, got to the hotel about 9 am and they were able to give me my room right away as well as an upgrade. My only complaint is that in the restaurants and some other areas they play music and it is much too loud. It's especially bad on the pool deck; the music is so loud it's difficult to relax and converse. At the pool I asked whether the music could be turned down but was rebuffed. It's unnecessary noise pollution and turns what should be a nice peaceful afternoon outdoors into a blaring disco. In spite of all that I would return."
4,wonderful trip,"nice, clean modern hotel with great amenities. wonderful, friendly staff at front desk check in. great gym. very clean, comfortable rooms. easy check in. hotel has great, central location near stores and restaurants."
2,"No rest, no sleep, no good coffee","This hotel was a real let down. First of all it’s a nice property, if you like or don’t mind convention hotels. My main issues came once I was in the room #2628. I heard what I thought was a dog barking but later realized that it was pipe noises or some sort of mechanical noise that sounded like a dog barking. I finally got to sleep but was awakened again at 7:00 am to loud banging and what sounds like noises in the pipes next to that room. The next morning it was the same thing- early morning awakening due to these “mechanical” types of sounds that were very loud and prevented any sleep or relaxation. As if that wasn’t enough, the coffee machine is archaic and the coffee tastes like dishwater. If you want a decent cup of coffee you have to go all the way down to the lower floor and walk a mile and wait in line to pay $4.00 for a cup of coffee. I will never stay at this property again. At the Fairmont you have a Nespresso machine in each room with fresh coffee pods for a great morning coffee experience. The noise alone in this room was so awful that the terrible coffee was insult to injury. I invite the manager of this property to sleep in room 2628 and try to get any rest at all. I returned to Houston completely exhausted."
5,"First visit to Austin, will definitely return for another!","I came to Austin for a work conference at the JW Marriott Austin. I was surprised at the number of dining options in and around the hotel. Overall great stay and I look forward to coming back to such a great city and hotel, but next time - no work, just for fun!"
5,Great visit,"The service was great, the room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and we loved the sky line view. Great location for walking to shops, restaurants, Sixth street venues, etc. Would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Austin."
4,Great location!,Location is fantastic! They have great bars and restaurants inside the hotel. I recommend walking over to the Elephant Room for live jazz. It was pretty noisy even though we were on the 23rd floor. We heard a lot of sirens. But the room was comfortable and very clean.
5,"Awesome location, beautiful decor, nice conference space","I stayed with the JW for a work conference which was held on the 2nd level. The event staff was so gracious & hospitable, the food was surprisingly delicious and prepared artfully for it being banquet food (you've taught me not to judge hotel food so harshly!) The steak food for the Texas themed banquet dinner was perfect & loved the sauce.The front desk staff, I wish I could remember her name but she was from Poland I believe was informative, warm, and truly made me feel welcomed.The room view was nice, the bathroom was my favorite. I thought the room decor itself was a bit boring and plain, but the lobby, restaurants, and event space was very well done.Appreciate the late checkout and granted request for a high floor.Excited to come visit again and will definitely consider staying with your hotel!Oh one note, the bottle water you provide guests tastes like you're drinking flowers. I know this is weird but its just a weird taste and I can only compare to a floral scent."
5,Highly recommend!!!,What a treat to stay here! Beautiful rooms and incredibly helpful staff. The JW team helped our conference rub so smoothly and I would highly recommend the ATX Marriott to anyone visiting Austin for business and/or pleasure.
4,Excellent overall experience,"The hotel was excellent. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room service was excellent. The hotel is extremely clean, and the service was generally top notch. Only gripe I have is that Marriott requires you to sign up for their rewards program to get free WiFi in your room. That means I have to get all of Marriott's rewards emails, which I would prefer not to get. For the cost of the room, free WiFi should be included, without having to sign up for the rewards program. Oh well..."
5,AMAZING!,"This hotel was not only beautiful inside and out, but it also had amazing staff, was super clean, and the pool deck was awesome. The hotel's location was perfect for getting around. I had a great time and I will be back!"
3,JW Austin Vegas comes to Austin,"Well the positives are this is a nice modern clean JW, rooms are spacious, furniture and bathrooms are good and staff are friendly. The negatives are this is a CONVENTION HOTEL first and foremost. They try to book as many as possible and the hotel is packed to the gills, good luck getting into an elevator that doesn't make MULTIPLE stops. The Lobby is literally a circus, the bar and restaurant are designed to have as much foot traffic as possible and this runs into the lobby. It is very loud, very crowded and a total scene. If a JW and a W decided to have a child, it would be this hotel. If you are in the mood for a ""Vegas"" like scene with a crowded lobby, loud bar scene and endless waits for an elevator then this is the perfect hotel for you...."
4,Not very accommodating,"We have 3 small children so us usually book 2 rooms to be more comfortable. We asked that they make a note upon booking that we would need connecting rooms. Called the week before to remind them about connecting rooms, call the morning of to request the connecting rooms. Nope, they said they could do nothing until we checked in and if they there available they would give them to us. Unfortunately for us, we work for a living so we did not arrive at hotel until a little after 5 which meant that they no longer had connecting rooms available. I called concierge the next morning requesting connecting rooms again and the concierge said she was busy with guests and that she'd get back to me. She never did and we spent our 4 day weekend in 2 separate bedrooms down the hall."
5,Amazing stay - wonderful property,JW's are usually great - the one in Austin has been amazing delivering excellent service and a great vibe. this was a combined family weekend followed by a business trip. Location was perfect and food/bars were great.
4,NAPEO,"I thought that the directions throughout the convention center were confusing with signage and how to get to conference rooms. Elevators seemed to be themed with wrong levels, too, in the conference area getting to higher levels."
5,Austin: great Family Time with grownup kids!,"Outstanding staff to guest ratio and relations. Besides great accommodations, I simply asked where I could buy a last minute birthday card and voila up came a bottle of champagne and beautiful tray of chocolate dipped strawberries!Really a great weekend filled with UT Longhorns, fantastic food and music along with great family and birthday celebrations!THANKYOU"
5,Conference Stay,The hotel was excellent. The location perfect. The staff amazing. Would recommend to anyone wanting a great vacation spot or looking for a location for a conference. Everything is a short distance away and honestly the restaurants are some of the best.
4,I used the spa and all I could hear during my treatment was banging dishes . Not very relaxing. It also appeared at time,"I used the spa and there was constant noise during the treatment , banging plates etc . The hotel was extremely cold and the elevators only seemed to have one working at a time, we waited 5 minutes or more to use them"
3,Do you like a party?!,"I wanted to absolutely love this hotel- great location, beautiful room, amazing views of Town Lake, aka Lady Bird Lake. I don’t know if I’ve ever had such a noisy room at such an expensive hotel. I was giving a presentation and was rudely awoken and kept awake for 2 hours by the raucous party in the room above me."
5,Stylish place with a warm feel,"This is the second time I have stayed at this Marriott location. They never seem to disappoint. They are courteous, professional, and helpful. Their rooms are always comfortable, the fitness area is spacious, and the property is well maintained."
4,terrible spa,The spa is worth skipping. Prices are OUTRAGEOUS for below then average service. So disappointing. Pool is cool. Hotel is general is beautiful. Rooms are nice. Does this stand out? Not really other then the high price. Front desk service was excellent.
5,Excellent,Everything was great. People were wonderful. The only thing I have to say is that you should leave the breakfast tag to order and leave on the door for pick up should be put in the room each day if it has been used. I used it the first day & never had another one to complete.
5,Great place to stay in Austin,Stayed at the JW for a conference. Hotel has a lot of dining choices and is walking distance to a ton of restaurants nearby. Multiple bars for entertaining and the staff and bartenders are top notch. Highly recommend this hotel next time you visit Austin.
4,In Austin for a Convention,"Visited this property as it was hosting a convention that i was attending.The facilities and room are very nice. It is a new property and kept in great shape. The pool was nice although small for the size of the hotel. The Gym was one of the nicest hotel Gyms that I have seen. The room was spacious and modern. The shower head in the room was amazing. I wanted to steal it and take it home.The convention facilities were very nice.The executive lounge was great for breakfast and hordeuvres. They had various snacks and beverages thru out the day. Very nice to have access to this.Now why only 4 stars?1. The room service meal that I had was terrible. Got the fried chicken sandwich and you would think in Texas it would be nice and crispy. It was borderline soggy. The shrimp cocktail came with Salsa? I get Tex Mex but that was just wrong.2. While the bed was very comfortable. The pillows felt cheap and offered NO support. Once your head went on it, the pillow was completely flat. Not what you expect of a 5 star facility. I was not able to sleep well for 3 days.3. The Towels and sheets smelled funny. I think they do not use bleach, it had a strange odor to all the linens and sheets.4. The towels felt thin and scratchy.5. Final straw was leaving in the self parking garage at around 4am. The gate was closed and i could not exit the facility. I get security, but at least have a drive up sensor to open the door. I thought maybe Austin was a quiet town with no early morning flights. I went to the airport and it was mobbed. I had to call to have them open the gate. The lady that answered the phone initially hung up on me and I had to call back. Not exactly the challenge that I wanted at 4am."
5,A great trip to Austin,Impressive hotel! The staff was unbelievably great. Very helpful and friendly. Everything was perfect.The workout facility was also immaculate and equipped with anything you could possibly need.No detail was left out.
5,Wonderful hotel and people!,"Everything about this hotel is wonderful, from the staff to the facilities. I have to give kudos to Aneka at the front desk who went out of her way to make me feel welcome. The entire staff on the property from restaurants to catering staff, housekeeping -- they were all extremely pleasant and focused on guest satisfaction."
4,My Stay,Service was outstanding. My only disappointment were the towels in the room? They felt work and rough. I woud be expecting a more luxurious towel ? And ice only on the 5th floor. I know they would deliver - but small annoyance. I lived with the ice - but nicer towels a biggee.
5,Bachelor Party Done Right!,"Having stayed at the property before on business, it was the first place I thought of when planning a bachelor party for 12 guys in their later 30’s. It is really hard to beat the location to both Rainey and 6th and to have the amazing outdoor pool on the 5th floor.They accommodated our desire to have our rooms on one wing of a floor, provided mini fridges on request and have frozen bags of ice ready for guests to use for whatever purposes in the Austin heat.They also extended my platinum status to the rooms I booked and we were all able to use the concierge lounge.I would stay there a 3rd time in a heartbeat!"
4,Good hotel,"Nice hotel and the customer service was good, but everything we asked for took over an hour to get. We asked for a refrigerator and a cable. The refrigerator took an hour and a half and the cable took two hours. Our coffee maker wasn’t working and we didn’t want to wait another hour for someone to bring one so we just didn’t have coffee."
5,Excellence,"Really high quality full service hotel. A big property at over 1,000 rooms, but very well managed. Never any lines for elevator, front desk or bar. Clean and well located. Professional and well-informed staff."
5,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful. Public spaces are modern, clean and filled with nice and friendly staff. The rooms are nicely appointed with all the amenities you could ask for. Awesome shower! I have to say that even the housekeepers were very friendly, saying hello whenever I encountered one in the hallways. Very nice.The price for the room was crazy high, but I've paid that much elsewhere and not been nearly as satisfied."
5,Friendly and helpful Staff,"We had our convention in this hotel. Completely professional staff. Clean meeting and sleeping rooms. Hotel is beautiful and felt very secure. We never had a need that was not met. We asked for help with recommendations on local vendors. They had great recommendations. I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a weekend away or a convention meeting space. Personal or business trip this is convenient to downtown, the river, Rainey street and 6th street. We rode scooters almost everywhere. Such a fun city to visit!"
5,Beautiful facility,"Great place to stay! All employees were helpful and attentive. Ice delivered to your room, Starbucks on site, 2 restaurants and a bar that served great drinks. Pizza was on point from the Italian restaurant!"
5,"Beautiful gym, pool, great location - highly recommend!","This place has the best hotel gym I have ever seen. Family and couple-friendly pool area with bar. Truly a great personal or work hotel.Very comfortable beds and great service. The person who checked me in took the time to walk around the counter and hand me the key. Everyone was incredibly friendly, warm and wonderful to engage with."
2,Not impressed,"Beyond the friendliness of the front desk, our stay was very disappointing.The bed was extremely uncomfortable.The breakfast at the executive lounge was terrible.In fact, the food within the entire hotel was bad.We won't be returning."
5,Love JW Mariotts!,We had a great experience. The customer service is outstanding. The concierge level is such an asset to busy schedules. Would definitely plan a stay at JW any time it is possible. 5 stars all the way!
5,First Rate,"The hotel and staff were first class. The decor was top notch and the staff seemed to geniunely care about the guests. The location is about four blocks from famous 6th Street and Rainey Street, which are the two main live music locations. The hotel is just far enough to escape the noise and crowd when you've had enough."
5,Wonderful Stay Here,"This is a very beautiful hotel. The staff is very friendly. Looking forward to go back for a visit. The room was clean and comfortable beds. Our room had a good view of the city. It is located in the heart of Austin with many areas within walking distance. There are many options for getting around, such as scooters or ride shares."
5,Sonic Natl Convention,"The staff was excellent, polite and very attentive. The professionalism was at the highest level from the valet and bell captain through the management. Our convention attendees were housed in several adjacent hotels. The level of service we received was envied by many of our colleagues staying at the competitors."
5,Excellent,"Stays like this are why I choose to be a Marriott rewards member. The staff (every single person) goes above and beyond to provide exemplary service. Incredible team that is attentive, professional and kind. Don’t waste your time on any other hotel."
5,Sonic Convention,"Very nice property and great location. Amazing food options within the hotel and within walking distance. We got room service and it was delicious and very fast! Very accommodating front desk and staff, they would always give me a complimentary water bottle when I asked!"
5,Business/Pleasure Trip To J.W. Marriott In Austin,The hotel is the best J.W. Marriott we have experienced. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is within walking distance of many Austin tourist locations. Restaurants inside the hotel are varied and reasonably priced.
5,Wonderful!,"Everything was wonderful! The staff was very pleasant, the rooms were impeccable and clean, it was overall very great. The on site restaurants and bars were great as well - pleasant foot and drink. No complaints!"
5,SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED,"We arrived to attend a convention. As we settled into the room, I noticed that no refrigerator was provided when one was needed. After logging into wifi and answering a preliminary survey, I received a call from the front desk concerning my semi-negative response. They assured me that they would have a complimentary fridge placed in the room immediately, and within 1-2 hours, we had a fully functional fridge for the duration of our stay. Superior service such as this was the case throughout our stay. The room was immaculately clean, and the bed was quite comfortable. Very enjoyable stay."
5,Incredible Executive Lounge,The Executive Lounge at this property is probably the nicest Marriott lounge I have experienced. This hotel is beautiful and extremely clean. I slept great while there and really enjoyed the walk-in shower option during the registration process.
5,Wonderful Place,It’s a beautiful property the service will make your stay enjoyable really well run hotelThe work out was very spacious and the parking was an easy in and out if you bring a car.Close to convention center easy 2 blocks alway walk
5,Great Room in Austin,"We stayed in an executive suite so, of course, it was very nice. Beautiful view of the river, and view of the downtown area. We loved the sliding doors separating the sleeping area from the sitting area. The bathroom had both a bathtub w/ shower, as well as a separate shower. The room was clean, convenient, and upscale."
4,Great location with an amazing outside seating area!,"We really enjoyed the stay because of the location. The staff was very friendly and responsive. We did have an issue with our toilet squealing the whole stay. Also, the safety feature in the elevator was a disaster for almost everyone that was in the elevator with us."
5,Great hotel,Great hotel.Really likes fresh rooms. Seemed recently refreshed. Bathroom was crisp and cleam and toiletries were ample and good quality.The only down side was in executive lounge at breakfast. Those darn plastic bag eggs and they just don't good.
5,Great hotel!,"Impressive customer service from check-in to check-out. Beautiful hotel with awesome rooms and clean bathrooms. The bed was one of the best we've slept in, and the room was very quiet - never heard the neighbors. Rented a cabana and had excellent pool service, plus the bartender was awesome. Will stay here again!"
5,Handled a full hotel of football fans beautifully!,"This hotel handles a large football crowd very well. (or any kind of crowd). Very nice hotel, great location, giant bar area with 2 other restaurant options. The pool was fun and a big party as well. We had a great time!"
4,Noisy Room next to Storage,"Room 3322, stayed 3 nights, The room begins to be very noisy about 5am as cleaning staff starts running machines...You should not use that room, certainly not provide it too Bonvoy Members! Not good. Other than that, room was fine."
5,Attended a conference at the JW Marriott-Austin,"I recently attended a professional conference at the JW Marriott in Austin. The experience was wonderful. The conference staff were very helpful and it was a well-run 3 days of meetings. The hotel accommodations were also top quality. The hotel is in walking distance of anything that you'd like to do in Austin...food, music, watching the bats. The rooms were comfortable, the shower was the best I've ever experienced, and the hotel staff were very accommodating from the moment of check-in, to getting advice from the concierge, to getting some toiletries that I ran short on. I'd go back in a second when in Austin."
5,Great Stay,"Great room, great amenities, all the staff were so helpful and kind. It was my birthday and they delivered champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. My friends and I had a really fun time that weekend."
4,Game day stay,"The staff were incredibly friendly and service oriented. Hotel is gorgeous. The only thing neg was reservations, check-in, check-out. Rate hike from reservations of $100 and putting two valet charges on one room."
5,Awesome,Staff was personable; service was prompt; room was luxurious. Our TV remote battery was low; they replaced it immediately along with warm cookies! Wow! Great time in a luxury environment!I give it A+
5,Well located. Inviting. Clean. Nice hospitality.,"In town for a conference. Good location. Close to many things to see and do by foot. Although not used, nice bar area, on site restaurant was not price gougy. Room was nice size, comfortable and clean. Modern feel."
4,Contemporary hotel in a convenient downtown location,"Rooms are unusually spacious with a flat screen TV, safe, coffee maker, and good wi-fi, but unfortunately no refrigerator. Parking can be self or valet. There are numerous restaurants and there is a lot of outdoor seating available. The exercise room has up to date equipment, and the pool has a huge deck that includes bar service. Unfortunately there is no hot tub, steamroom, or sauna. There is a spacious Concierge Lounge offering a basic breakfast and limited evening hors d'oeuvres. Lounge personnel were friendly and helpful. If you are a Marriott elite member, don't expect too much. Our upgrade was limited to a room on a higher floor. There is no separate check in for elite members who have to stand in line with all the guests. Bathrooms are basic and apparently have only showers, no tub."
4,Leisurely Trip to Austin,"Location is excellent accessible to restaurants,shops and sights. There was an LSV vs Texas football game this weekend and the service was better with the full hotel but when the hotel died down, the service actually dropped a bit which you would think would be the other way around. Rooms themselves are nice, however no fridge and you can hear everything. I could hear someone snoring even with a noise machine on."
5,austin 2019,Rylee with Guest services helped our group... she was excellent before we got there and easy to work with. Her attention to detail and patience with changes made the experience very enjoyable! I look forward to working with Rylee again.
5,Great hotel Great bar Great location,Great hotel for football weekends. Lots of seating in the bar area with several TVs if you don’t have tickets to the game. Also nice if you are with a group and need a large seating area to meet up. One of the best front desk experiences I’ve ever had. Very friendly employees.
5,4th Quarter comeback,"At check-in there was an issue with room availability for the room type I needed/reserved. While it took a little time to straighten out, the property and staff went out of their way to make it up to us."
5,Baby Moon-ish weekend,The hotel decor was fun & clean. There were several dining options. The hotel location was perfect for walking to different places. The roof top pool was clean & relaxing. The rooms were relaxing & clean
5,Excellent Location + Excellent Staff = Excellent Stay,"My stay at the JW Marriott Austin was phenomenal. From the pre-arrival stage to departure the staff was tremendously helpful and accessible.One staff, in particular, Jon (without an ""h"" was how he helped me remember his name) provided SUPERB service! From our arrival to the checkout date, he was the most attentive staff that I have ever experienced at a hotel. While all the staff was great, Jon provided an extra special touch during our stay. He made sure that my Marriott Bonvoy rewards were added and honored. He checked in with us to make sure that we had everything that we needed. Every time we enter the lobby while he was on staff at the front desk, he remembered us and made us feel like we were arriving for the first time. I truly can not say enough about his service. He needs to be a trainer for other hotels!Overall, it was a magnificent stay. The room accommodations are modern and spacious, especially for the higher floors where we were staying. The hotel has a great rooftop bar with a wonderful view and drink choices. In general, it's a great location that is close to many wonderful dining choices. It is exactly what one would expect from the 2nd largest JW in the world (learned that from Jon without an ""h"").I will definitely return!"
5,Great service and staff.,We traveled during an extremely busy football weekend in Austin. Staff did an amazing job handling the crowd. Was very impressed with everything from chk in till the time we departed 👍 will definitely stay here again next time in Austin.
5,lsu tiger weekend,just a lote to recomend this marriott property to visitors of austin txenjoyed the amenities on site. plenty of bars and resturrants as well as a great roof top.rooms were adequates and tastful. employees are courteous and responsive.i will stay there anytime im in austin.
4,LSU vs. TEXAS weekend,"May I suggest on “BIG” weekends (like football games) that you engage more wait staff and servers. It took a very long time for food to be served or to get service at your bar. The staff appeared overwhelmed. Other than that, VERY NICE! I will stay there again if the opportunity arises"
5,Great Hotel and Employees know Customer Service,"I have stayed at this property four times and every time is a great stay. I have been greeted with a smile and warm ""how can I assist you today? "" from the staff. Always provide answers to any questions I have had, and when there was an issue with my room - went the extra mile to correct the issue right away. It us a busy hotel and lot of things going on - but the staff never seems to be flustered. I have and will continue to recommend this hotel to colleagues and friends."
3,Not my favorite stay,"Stayed at the JW Marriott while in town for a concert for a few days. First the positive, the location is great. The rooms were clean and the shower had good pressure. I also found the staff to be good and friendly.However, I had the same experience as several others who posted reviews and who stayed during the same weekend which is that even though I was on the 15th it was noisy due to loud music coming from below. Thus, I had a hard time sleeping.The hotel was swarmed with people coming in for the LSU-UT game. While that is not the fault of the hotel per se, my thought is that the hotel is simply too big in size for its own good and thus lends itself to being very busy.My last comment is that they place ice buckets in the room yet there are no ice machines on the floors and thus you need to call for ice. I thought that was little odd given the presence of ice buckets in the room.Should I go to Austin again I am not sure I would stay at this property again particularly if I were to learn that there is a big event going on in town."
5,Amazing comfort,No detail was overlooked. The room was clean and comfortable. They had all the services that I needed and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. I would definitely stay here again when in the Austin area.
5,Awesome,"Hotel was wonderful. Loved the rooftop swimming pool and bar. The hotel is near everything in Austin: bats, restaurants, museums, bars, convention center and river. The only thing that we weren't aware of was asking for a mini fridge for the room. I wish that had been mentioned. The staff was very nice and accommodating."
1,Terrible Choice If You Want A Good Night's Sleep,"I travel to Austin frequently and the JW Marriott is on my short list of hotels that I consider when booking a room. It's a very large hotel so it frequently has conventions/company meetings on-site. Sometimes it isn't an issue, but often they overrun the place, making it a terrible experience for other guests.Yesterday (a Thursday night), the group overwhelmed all of the public areas, including the lobby and lobby bar. They had a party on the pool deck from 7 to 11 with a band that was so loud that, even on the 33rd floor, it sounded like there was a radio on high volume in my room. After 11, the conventioneers were drunk and wandering the halls until well past midnight.This is the second time this year that I have had this exact experience so ""fool me twice"" - I won't stay there again. When I called during the evening, I got profuse apologies but no action. Again, more apologies this morning on check-out. I find the apologies to be hollow, since they control the property and make the rules. Why not send a manager to the party and have the band turn it down? As a Ambassador member who stays at Marriotts over 100 times a year, i was promised a call from a manager that never happened.In summary, this is an absolutely terrible choice if you are not there as part of a convention. The Fairmont is large, but quiet with good service. The Westin is good if you are tied to the Marriott program. And, of course, the Four Seasons is excellent if you can stomach the price. The JW Marriott has favored conventions at the expense of regular guests - let them have the conventions and take your business elsewhere"
1,Loud Music Late into the Night,"I stayed at this hotel because I thought it had a good reputation. I'm a business traveler and have a reasonable expectations that any loud music would stop at 10pm at the latest so I can actually get a good night's rest before a day full of meetings tomorrow. Apparently Marriott thinks differently. Some organization or conference is hosting a party by the pool, which is on the 5th floor. I am on the 21st floor and the music is so loud in my room that I could dance to it. The problem is that I actually do need to sleep. I called the desk and got a million platitudes and apologies but zero action. I also know that I am not the only guest outraged by this right now.,The reality is that Marriott apparently lets parties that pay enough money blast their music until at least 11pm if not later. So if you need to sleep, DON'T STAY HERE"
4,Business,"Great service, friendly and useful. Pool too crowded for any swimming. Quiet and well insulated rooms. Could have benefited from a mini fridge, no mini bar meant my cold drink purchases went to room temperature."
5,Everything was perfect!,"This JW was absolutely amazing! Conveniently located, beautiful hotel wonderful rooms (my favorite part was the shower and bed) the food was amazing, the staff was great! We had an amazing experience! If you go to the corner bar make sure to see Amanda!! She is so sweet and helpful!Oh and for you Starbucks lovers... there is even a Starbucks on the second floor!!!"
5,Excellent!,"Always great service, friendly & professional staff! Rooms always clean & comfortable. Cool poolside bar. Had a great Valet experience as well - if coming in off of Congress (versus Brazo), there are barriers to block a left hand turn pulling into hotel....Valet was very sympathetic to my 6-7 point u-turn to negotiate around the blockade and greeted me like a VIP. Great way to start a stay at the best downtown Austin hotel!"
5,Simply Excellent,"I went to the Texas opening Day football game , the hotel is extremely nice , service was great , room was spacious and every comfortible . I will stay here again no problem . Great location easy offf the highway into downtown Austin"
5,Loved JW Austin,"This was our first time at the property and we loved it. Not only was the location great, but the staff and service was top notice from the minute we walked in the door. We will definitely stay here again!"
4,Great experience,"Stayed at the JW Austin for 5 nights in August. Very comfortable rooms and bedding. Staff went above and beyond to be helpful. Great location for walking to many restaurants and of course Karaoke bar, Penny Lane."
5,Super awesome,"The hotel was super clean, nice, and relaxing. The beds were comfortable. All of the staff were nice and welcoming. The Valet parking was very quick. The views are nice too. The rooms are spacious and the shower is amazing."
5,Terrific service at Registration and the Bell Desk,"From registration to checkout, including help at the Bell Desk, the service was terrific. I did not use the gym (this time), but checked it out, many machines, well laid out. The pool looked nice (too hot outside for that this trip). My room was quiet and well-appointed; however, it was an ADA-compliant room (the only room left?), so no divider on the floor of the shower (the bathroom floor gets wet), and the closet clothing rod was lower than usual. Overall, I would stay here again!"
5,A nice place to stay in Austin,The hotel was clean and comfortable. The room was spacious and provided the needed amenities (once we learned a refrigerator could be delivered to the room). Plus the view was great! Guest services was friendly and helpful. The attached restaurants and bars served excellent fare.
4,Nothing to complain but nothing special,"We enjoyed our time at the JW Marriott and had no major complaints, but for the price we were paying it didn’t feel luxurious. We had just come from the Guild which was a fraction of the price considering we need two rooms at the JW and there wasn’t an appreciable difference. Location is good, staff was nice and rooms are fine. Gym was excellent and pool was good. This was the lain reason we came since we wanted a heated pool for the kids. Would recommend the hotel as we enjoyed but certainly not a “value” play."
5,Excellent stay,"Very good stay with great service and amenities. Pool is awesome but not the most kid friendly. Rooms were comfortable and spacious for a family of 4, with enough lights, USB ports, towels, pillows and other items that make a hotel stay convenient."
5,Excellent visit,"This was an excellent hotel for the conference, close and easy to access as well as close to several food establishments. Nice visit and felt very comfortable with the accommodations. Staff were friendly and helpful."
5,The best stay yet at the JW Austin,"From the moment we arrived the concierge team took care of us. Checked us in quickly and ushered us to the elevators while the bellman took care of our luggage. The team set aside chairs by the pool with an umbrella for our time by the pool. Sarah in the lobby lounge was perfection as always. Thank you Richard and team for taking care of us, we will be back."
5,Great hotel and location in Austin!,"The room was lovely, clean, very comfortable bed and had a nice view of the city. I loved that you could have a walk-in shower or tub, depending on preference. The location was super, could walk easily to convention center, restaurants, and Capitol. Hotel staff was excellent in every location - front desk, restaurant, bar, front drive. My room was so quiet (12th floor) that I didn't think anyone else was located on this floor."
5,Fantastic service,"I was very pleased with the stay at the JW Marriott. I had never been treated so well by ALL the employees there. Over and over, it was apparent that the staff were all on the same page. The rooms are beautifully appointed, as well."
5,Great place to stay - convenient location - extra special treatment,"At a recent stay at the JW Marriott Austin for a GFWC convention, attention to detail was appreciated. Our hotel stay here was perfect from start to finish: early check in on date of arrival (kuddos to Joshua Brown), very clean room, great amenities, very helpful staff made our visit memorable.A request of a refrigerator in our room was quickly answered. Highly recommend this hotel when in Austin."
5,Fantastic service,"I was very impressed with the service I received from the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out of the hotel. Every request I had they were able to accommodate quickly and competently. The entire staff were extremely kind, respectful and friendly."
3,Nice effort,"The JW Marriott in Austin wants to be the hub of a fun and thriving downtown area. While their aspirations and dreams are visible in places glaring omissions reveal the lack of fully understanding the needs of customers and running a large staff. Staff were disjointed in all parts of the operation working at cross purposes with too many or too fee and never the right amount. The desire for top notch restaurants is admirable, but again staffing makes this effort fall short. And don’t plan on taking food to your room because refrigerators are conspicuously missing from a place that brags about delivery of ice to your room. While my stay was pleasant and nothing was truly complaint worthy, the JW just falls short of greatness in its execution."
5,We had a great time.,"Overall it was great. If you are fortunate enough to gain access to the executive suite, you can’t bring in any business folks traveling with you into it. But people will bring six kids with them to destroy the entire room, running around like monsters, food everywhere, there was some extremely bad parenting on display. It nearly ruined our entire stay."
5,Best hotel experience ever,Staff all very friendly and guest oriented. They dropped a task when I went to the desk. Response to a request was answered immediately. Not once did anyone have an attitude or frown at me. Handled a problem with a business card fast and efficient.
5,Awesome,"This place is awesome. Would totally come here again. The hotel is clean, classy, and courteous. I had a small issue at the beginning, and they quickly apologized and compensated me for the hassle. Thank you JW Marriot."
5,"Fantastic Stay - Great hotel, location, and staff","Our hotel stay here was fantastic from start to finish. Early check in on date of arrival, very clean room. Great amenities. Very helpful staff. Location of hotel was so central to everything. And we were given a very Kate check out as our plane didn't leave until later in the evening. All the staff were so pleasant and truly seemed to care about the people there. Highly recommend this hotel when in Austin."
5,Excellent Accommodations,"This hotel is beautiful and the service, food & drink are all really good. I enjoyed my stay very much! I would have like a small fridge in my room. But other than that, it’s was 👍 especially liked the different choices for dining!"
5,Austin stay,At every turn customer service is priority as evidenced by the staff in serving their guests. I really appreciated the cleanliness of the property at all levels. What a peaceful and pleasure staying in the JW Mariott Austin.
2,Racism,"I overheard the valet driver using racial epithets which was very hurtful to my girlfriend and myself. He was definitely directing the comments toward our relationship. He began speaking in an stereotypical Indian accent, and making fun of the height difference between my girlfriend and me. If that had not occurred I would have nothing but great things to say about the jw in Austin."
5,Best hotel in Austin,"Very quiet hotel in the center of downtown with amazing staff who are courteous and will do anything to make your stay better. Views from rooms are great and the rooms are clean, spacious and have all the touches you would want."
5,CJ's Marriott Review,"This is a wonderful property with great improvements in both structure and service since I was here about 4 years ago. Special Kudos to the friendly staff especially Jon from concierge for his great customer service, his friendly demeanor and positive attitude and also Oscar and his team for being so accommodating. The food was also better from what I remembered. So good job over all."
5,"Comfortable, with high end feel","Nothing bad to say. Service was exceptional. Room was modern but comfortable, and in great shape.Many options for after work cocktails in the lobby.Checkout Cooper's BBQ around the corner. Delicious"
5,Amazing Staff - Excellent Customer Service,I travel frequently and the level of customer service at this hotel was the best I have ever experienced. The Staff welcome every guest as they step into the hotel from rushing to help them with their luggage or shopping packages as they enter the lobby or walking them to the correct elevator after checking in. I've really never seen anything quite like it.
4,First visit,Overall great experience and enjoyable. Restaurants were convenient and table with electrical outlets for laptops and phone charging a plus.Check in and out was very good for staff took time to assist when requesting additional information. They were outstanding
5,My Stay at the Austn JW,Always available to answer questions and to address your needs (ice delivery). Very friendly and helpful staff. The total experience was great from check in to check out. The only negative that I have is that I have is that I was given directions that took me through the Corner restaurant (door) and was given a very unfriendly look from the girl at the hostest desk.
5,Excellent establishment. We loved our room.,"We loved our stay, specially because the hotel is walking distance to most places to visit. We loved it. Loved the pool and bar near the pool. Great area to just relax. Also, great to have a Starbucks in the hotel."
4,Nice Hotel but I Expected a Little More,"This is a hard review to write. The hotel, staff, and location were all very good but there was nothing that made the experience special. It's really hard to put your finger on it but if I were to return to Austin, I'd probably try another downtown hotel.The hotel seems pretty new and the lobby, rooms, pool, and other areas are all very nice. Staff were friendly. I ate at the Italian restaurant one night and I would not recommend it.Location is good but if you're going to the convention center you should know there are many hotels closer. The Marriott is about two blocks away.The doormen/valet guys didn't seem very knowledgeable about the area. On my first morning I asked with direction to the Convention Center and he didn't know! Another time I asked if taxis were generally available around 4am and he wasn't sure. I found that odd.Bottom line--I can't think of any reason not to stay but I probably wouldn't again."
4,"Great Personnel, Well Run, Minor issues","Was greeted warmly and received my key promptly. Room was clean and quiet for the city. The bars and restaurants are good quality and reasonably priced. I paid less than my local pub price for a common beer in the lobby. The only bad items are fitness equipment. The lone cycle was damaged and not usable. The pool was very warm, maybe high 80's, not refreshing on a 101 deg day after a run. Also, there are not full-size ironing boards to be had. Which is odd as the room ironing boards are just over two feet long and you cannot iron a sleeve let alone a whold shirt."
4,Overall stay experience.,"The staff are courteous and readily willing to provide assistance. However, the room cleaning team needs to follow their policies and procedure. For the 5-day stay, bedsheets we’re not for once changed despite the policy of changing it every three day or by special request. I was charged for WIFI despite having registered for membership. Overall, I still rate the hotel as very good."
5,"Conveniently located, well appointed hotel","I stayed at the JW Marriott in Austin while attending a national conference held at the Austin Convention Center. The hotel's location was very convenient to the center as well as the conference's main social event (@ Austin City Limits). Close to public transit stops (low cost option while visiting!).This hotel has all you would need, a business center, spa, fitness center (plenty of cardio & weight machines) and a pool.I would recommend and return to this property!"
5,Annual meeting - Business visit,"Excellent stay as always, at this property. Staff was friendly and attentive and I like the idea of posting someone outside of club lounge, to verify access, and minimize access to those individuals who did not meet requirements to gain access"
5,Gorgeous JW Marriott in heart of Austin,"This JW Marriott is a gorgeous hotel in the heart of Austin. It is a 2 block walk to Convention Center and around bars and great restaurants. Good restaurants on property and a Starbucks! The only compliant I have which is why I docked the Service is I have called twice now requesting a receipt to be emailed and I requested at checkout and have yet to receive it and it's been 3 days! Also, even with status you do not get late checkout."
5,Great Stay!,"Was here for a conference. Great location - close to all the spots we wanted to visit in Austin. From the very beginning. the front desk was quick, courteous, and helpful with check-in. Clean rooms and comfortable beds. The shower... spacious with the perfect water pressure! It always felt amazing. The rooftop pool was very nice. Beautiful view, and I really enjoyed their playlist! Hotel lobby bar was very energetic. Conference area was great with tasty food and snacks in between.My only gripe was that the valet took a very long time with the car the first time we had to pick it up (about 40 minutes). However, after that, they suggested to call in for pickup instead of texting the number, which was much smoother. Overall great stay."
5,Recent Stay During NIGP Conference,"Everything about this visit was perfect. Expert staff ensured that every part of visit was above par, room was clean, quiet, and bed was perfect. Nicest amenites I've experinced - I don't want to stay anywhere else when visiting Austin!"
5,ASCRS / ASOA meeting,Great accommodations and the staff was wonderful. Couldn't have been better.I really enjoyed the breakfast on the 5th floor. Everybody was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the facility. I had a wonderful time
4,JW Marriott Austin,"As always the JW never ceases to impress. Their customer services, amenities and room quality are bar none. Just wish Marriott would of not changed their rewards methods. At least hold their members last status category in order to keep those perks."
5,Great Experience!,"The service, amenities, staff and overall hotel experience was amazing! The banquet facilities and service were top notch as well. The location is perfect. I will definitely stay here every time I visit Austin."
5,Beautiful property!,"Stayed here once a year for several years. It was a business trip where my spouse joined me. The location is perfect for seeing the city, and also perfect business space. Love this property. Rooms are comfortable, food is great, location is convenient. Pool is fun."
5,Great stay,"We decided to come to Austin for a long weekend. The hotel was comfortable and convenient to restaurants, riverfront and downtown. The service was outstanding. We enjoyed breakfasts at the wonderful executive lounge. Dinner one night at Cornerstone was also very hood. Pool area was small but beautifully appointed."
5,Excellent Property,"What a great JW Marriott in a great location. I had dinner at the Italian OP and it was excellent. The field green salad was pure and plain with a great dressing. I had the shrimp pasta and again, it was spectacular. The pool was vibrant and exciting. My room was comfortable and modern."
5,"Great location, excellent service",Stayed at the property for a conference. It's ideally located in a central downtown location. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Only issue was a strange whirring sound as my room was near storage and an elevator. Staff provided excellent service - very friendly and helpful.
5,Incredible Downtown Views,"Absolutely loved this property!! Central to everything and incredible views from our high floor corner room!! The only issue was the deafening noise level in the lobby (both Friday and Saturday evenings) and in the Burger Bar Restaurant on Friday. You had to yell to be heard, conversation wasn't possible, not pleasant at all due to several groups holding meetings at the property and too many drunk bridal parties. Take time to enjoy to pool and gym, you won't regret it."
5,Austin for a conference,I was very pleased with my stay at the JW Marriott in Austin. The room was very comfortable with plenty of space. The bed was comfy and the bathroom has plenty of counter space. The best was the water pressure in the shower....awe! It's convenient to all of the downtown attractions. I rented one of the scooters out front and scootered to the Capital and that was a hoot. Easy access to the bat bridge and the waterfront boat tours. Great stay in Austin.
5,COS Convention,"The hotel, staff, and facilities were top notch. I have visited this hotel several times over the last five years and it has never disappointed. The staff welcomed us at the door and quickly checked us in early since rooms were available. They thanked me for being a Lifetime Titanium Member and upgraded my room. Any questions we had during our stay were answered in detail and with a very positive attitude. We were able to utilize both of the restaurants, the gym, and the lobby bar. The quality of the food was exceptional and helped make our trip even that much more enjoyable. The hotel is located in perfectly within the city and allowed us to explore the sights without having to travel too far throughout the day. These are the reasons I am a loyal customer to Marriott and will continue to be in the future. My compliments to your staff and the way they engage with their customers, even when it is extremely busy. We felt like we were welcomed from the very beginning of our trip."
5,Pareto Conference,We were greeted personally by someone waiting outside the check in desk. Everyone was very friendly and the customer service was on point. Event rooms were set up perfectly. Food for event was amazing.
5,Great hotel,"The staff was friendly, and the check-in process was so easy and efficient. The app helps a lot. The room was very nice and spacious. I stayed at this location due to a business conference being held here. The facilities were excellent, and the food was wonderful."
4,Austin conference hotel,"I stayed again at the JW Marriott in Austin and had another great experience. The room had a nice view of the river. The bathroom, unfortunately didn't have a tub (I know I'm an exception on liking tubs) and the lighting isn't great. But clean. The location is great in Austin."
5,APG 08/22-08/25/2019,"Great stay! The hotel staff were phenomenal, very polite and quick to respond to any issue or request. I had a minor issue with the TV remote, but the staff responded as if were a major item and had the issue resolved in no time. The room was clean, the food excellent, and the atmosphere awesome!"
5,Business Trip,Excellent hotel! Clean and friendly staff! Everyone I came in contact during my stay always spoke and asked how I was....even the maid service. I would recommend this hotel. Restaurants are easily accessible and several to chose from.
3,Junior varsity,When you go to a JW Marriott the expectation is superior service. We got treated like we were at the Days Inn while at the Austin JW Marriott. Twice there was no follow up on commitments. And no refrigerator in our room? Seriously? When we asked for one they brought one that looked like it had been through 10 years at a University of Texas freshman dorm room.
5,Excellent stay!,"Wonderful hotel! Will definitely go back! Room clean and spacious, service great. Great place for meeting. Great restaurants in hotel. Loved everything about it. Pool was super fun along with rooftop bar."
5,Everything You'd Expect plus a Bonus!,"I was in town just for a day and I was so happy they let me check in early on the app. The room and bathrooms were renovated and updated; I'm so glad someone figured out that not all of us need a bath - a great shower is better! - and thank you for the water. The starbucks on the 2nd floor is also a great addition to the hotel - definitely a plus. Lastly, the hotel is right in the middle of everything!"
5,Lovely stay in downtown Austin,"We had a corner room on a high floor and it was lovely. Quiet and relaxing is what we were looking for and the Marriott delivered. Pool area is similar to others in Austin, more of a lounge than a true pool. Not really kid friendly nor could a kid really have fun and swim. Luckily I didn’t have my kiddo on the trip, but know that is what some families would be looking for. Gym was fantastic, one of the better ones I’ve been in. Great job and we’ll definitely be coming back!"
2,Tough stay at Jw Marriott Austin,"I spent two nights at this hotel on business this week. I was not able to rest the first night because there was a loud, intermittent sound coming from the plumbing in the bathroom. I reported this to the the manager and he was polite and apologetic. He assure me this would be resolved for the second night. He also sent me a coupon for a few coffee. However, we had the same problem the second night. I didn’t call down after the second night thinking there was nothing different I could do from the previous night, and frankly, it was no longer my problem. As I was leaving my room in the morning, I received a $50 voucher for the hotel restaurant, which I was not able to use because I had a flight to catch. I know this could have happened at any hotel, but when you pay JW prices you expect better. I really wished this would have been handled differently."
5,Staff was totally attentive and service flawless,"I stayed at the JW Marriot in Austin for five nights, made use of in-room dining and the restaurants, valet service, meeting rooms, pool and fitness center. I requested a room convenient to the fitness center in advance and received a great location enabling easy access. Food was uniformly well prepared and flavorful. The staff could not have been more helpful. My experience here made me think twice about being hotel brand agnostic and explore Marriott's loyalty program."
5,Awesome property,Great stay We were here three nights for a business conference. From checking in to checking out pure pleasure .Perfect downtown location with an amazing view from the rooftop pool area The pool was such a pleasure.Next time in Austin this will definitely be our home away from home.
5,The excellent JW Marriott,"Rooms are clean, comfortable & the very best showers! Evening turn-down service is appreciated, as well as the in-room complimentary water bottles. Starbucks on the second floor has reasonable prices! We will keep going back!"
5,Beautiful property and great location!,The JW Marriott in downtown Austin is the perfect hotel! It is located within walking distance of many restaurants and the ACL Moody Theater. The staff is welcoming and service is fantastic. Our room was comfortable and well-appointed. We will be back!
5,Excellent facility and staff,"From the front desk staff to the cleaning crew to the facilities themselves, the JW Marriott Austin created an excellent guest experience. I went on business but would go back for fun. Apparently I need to type a few more words before my answer is long enough to be accepted by the bots. So there. I hope now that we've all been subjected to a meaningless forced extension of vocabulary that we can get on with our day and the robot overlords will accept my meager submission. The cheerful and courteous staff of the JW Marriott Austin wouldn't have done this to me. They would have respected my time and given me a complimentary bottle of water so that I didn't get dehydrated in the heat of Austin's glorious summertime. People > Robots."
5,ESTO Convention,"I had an excellent stay, the rooms were very nice and clean, loved the hair products. The staff at the check-in were very professional and friendly. Overall stay was very nice. Meeting rooms were excellent."
4,Cool Hotel at 104 degrees!,Great Facility Staff attentive and helpful. I wonder about the practice of having the pool open to the public as it was overcrowded on Sat/Sun with more than just hotel guests.Other than that great Bar staff at pool!
5,Perfect retreat in Austin,"While there are several good lodging options in Austin, the JW Marriott ranks supreme. Perfect location, great, attentive team, excellent dining options, wonderful and spacious lobby - and VERY comfortable rooms. What more could you want out of a hotel stay? Nothing!"
5,What an awesome staff and beautiful facility,"It started from the moment Goktug checked me in - efficient, friendly, fast, accommodating - I can't remember having a better and more impressive check in experience following a very trying travel day. Every person on the JW team followed suit, from bell desk to front drive valet - these folks were on their GAME and it was noted. I also absolutely loved my large guest room and the beautiful walk-in shower and bath products. The geodes over the light fixtures on the bathroom sink wall gave the room a true sense of artistry and the buckle details on the leather headboard of the bed were also extraordinarily beautiful - reminding me that I wasn't at a random Marriott - I was at a JW. Fast elevators (I recommend getting a room on 25th floor or higher to take advantage of that elevator bank) and the meeting rooms were large, modern and very comfortable. Awesome catering staff and beautiful food for our convention. I would strongly recommend that meeting planners look to this hotel for its flexibillity, beauty and the quality of its staff and its culinary excellence. I would look forward to planning a meeting here in the future. The Burger Bar on the street level is really fun and the Starbucks on level 2 is very convenient and well run. There is a lounge on level 5 that is beautiful and well-staffed. There is a very aggressive homeless population located on the Congress Street side of the hotel and this played a role in my daily comfort (lack thereof), but I do not hold JW responsible for this deplorable state of affairs. It is just a warning to future guests to not be careless around this aggressive panhandling scene - it is unlike any I have seen in America (or worldwide for that matter). Good restaurants are located nearby but you will not be able to walk a single block without being accosted. It is always a relief to be back in the hotel (great air conditioning as well in the room and public spaces)."
5,Exceptional,A true 5* star experience in the heart of downtown Austin. All the staff we dealt with were attentive and friendly. Our stay was exceptional and it appears this hotel is very well managed because everything was so efficient. This is a true gem in Austin.
5,Work Trip,"It was my first trip to Austin for a work conference and my stay at the JW Marriott was wonderful! The staff was more than pleasant and, while at the bar and restaurants, I was also so pleased with the service and food! Thanks for the wonderful experience!"
5,Excellent Stay!,"John was the most amazing front desk staff person I’ve ever met! From that moment on, everything was just wonderful. The beds are super comfortable and the shower pressure is perfect. The property has great dining with a good happy hour. Location is great. I cannot find one complaint about this place."
5,"Fabulous hotel, fabulous service and fabulous food!","Thanks you, JW Marriott Austin, for the fantastic hospitality. I broke my leg several months ago and my leg was swelling with all of the meetings and heat, etc. You brought me a huge container of ice to help my leg. And - all of my food was delivered well before the given timeframe and all of it was delicious. And special shout out to Harold in the Italian restaurant where I got dinner to go two nights in a row. He was so friendly and engaging. Smart young man! Thanks for all of the servers at the ESTO conference too - they were amazing. Great staff and help!"
5,Great experience,"The JW Marriott in Austin is a wonderful hotelwith great service, caring associates,excellent food, and spacious, clean rooms.It has a comfortable lounge in the lobby.I recommend it to anyone who wants tostay in am upscale hotel."
5,Not 5 Stars -- 10 Stars!!!,"The Austin JW Marriott sis outstanding. Staff was always available to provide assistance. Tips are pooled together and shared. Conference food was delicious & service was professional, polite & cordial.Definitely TEN STARS."
5,Great first trip to Austin,Had a conference in Austin. Added a day at both ends with spouse. Hotel was full with our group but amazing service from the minute we walked in the door. Personal service and attention to detail. Superb.
4,Great Location,"Disappointed there was no microwave or refrigerator in the room since the hotel was upscale. Staff was attentive and courteous. Within walking distance to the “bat” bridge, Congress Street, and music venues."
5,Amazing service,This hotel exceeds expectations!! From point of arrival to all interactions with all staff every one here is extremely helpful and attentive providing above and beyond what initial requests were ... love it!!
5,Great stay,I was in Austin for a work conference. The hotel was a great place to stay and a great place for the conference. The downtown location made it easy to explore town - we walked everywhere. The staff was over the top friendly and gave us great recommendations for attractions and food. I would definitely recommend this hotel!
4,"Good service, central location","We stayed for two nights to explore downtown Austin. The hotel is very clean and the service checking in was great and the valet service was quick as well. The bathroom was large as was the room as a whole. We stayed on a weekend when a travel convention was in town. I wished that we had gotten a room with a full view of the lake, but I'm sure they were all given to those from the industry. The room rate was a bit high, but I guess that is to be expected for this brand. Definitely consider this hotel to explore the Austin sights as it is very centrally located."
5,As advertised,Great job from the welcome at the front desk to the great customer service during the stay. I was there for 5 days and found the experience seamless. Ratings for the property proved out. I would recommend this property and loved the quiet time guidelines.
5,Great visit,Wonderful stay. Enjoyed the pool and fitness center. Location was perfect. Close to restaurants and shopping. Staff was welcoming and knowledgeable. Will definitely stay at the JW on my next visit to Austin.
5,Great place and great people,"Very clean, unique and best of all the customer service was outstanding. Is in the heart of downtown Austin, so everything is easily accessible. Dinning in the restaurant was a little pricey but food was good."
5,Exceptional,"I was here only one night for business, but in that short stay, I needed deodorant, a printer, FedEx pick-up and concierge assistance. Every need was met, saving me from panic, and making my short stay a success!"
5,Ron’s Alec review,The staff was outstanding and the service was excellent. I would recommend this Hotel to all. I asked for distilled water and a box fan and it was delivered within 30 minutes. The room was one of the best I have ever been in and it was quiet.
5,Heartland,"It was a fun filled trip! Thank you all the staff for making my stay an amazing experience. The rooms were amazing, the food was very well prepared. I hope to stay with you again in the future.😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄"
4,Great service,"Your services are very good. The people are friendly and helpful. What I am always disappointed in, not just in your hotels, is the lack of adequate lighting in the bathrooms. Most women can't put makeup on in a dimly lit room."
5,Excellent Facility,Received excellent service Staff went out of their way to be helpful. Staff were knowledgeable about events. Facilities were very clean and audio visual worked well. Helpful staff. Love the Starbucks in the hotel.
4,KW Conference,"The price for the room was expensive and no breakfast included. Room was clean, spacious and nice.Location and proximity to the convention center was good. One big negative is that there is no shuttle from the airport. You have to factor in another $70 for 2 way travel from and to airport."
5,Great stay in Austin,"The JW served up some good Texas hospitality. Room was perfect and the concierge lounge was top notch! I was there for a conference and the meeting spaces were very nice as well as the food, which is unusual for a big conference hotel."
5,Lots to love,"Each staff person I encountered from the valet, to bell hop, to registration, the spa & even on the phone was so helpful & friendly. The rooms are uniquely decorated specific to Austin, with high design elements as well. LOVE the wall sconces in the bathrooms! The rooftop pool is also lovely - go early, when it’s shaded before the sun bakes you. Excellent dining options - too many to choose from. Would definitely stay here again!"
5,Outstanding,"Every thing about this hotel was top notch. The service was friendly, the room large, clean, and comfortable, and the amenities were plentiful. I would certainly stay here again if given the opportunity."
5,Excellent Staff,Joshua Brown upon check in saved the day! Took extra time and toggled between his own cellular phone and the landline to locate my phone left behind in the Lyft used from the airport.Thank you for going above and beyond!
5,Expectations Exceeded,"When I first walked through the door of the JW Marriott Austin, I was greeted by Harley, who walked me to the front desk where she checked me in, gave an overview of the hotel, and escorted me to the appropriate elevator bank. This was the start of what would become exceptional levels of service throughout my stay. From the friendly staff at the Starbucks on the second floor of the hotel, to the great staff at the Corner Restaurant--special shout out to Kevin and Trey who remembered me throughout my visit--I was treated so well that I actually felt like everyone cared about me and my visit. The hotel's gym is well appointed and spacious, though a couple pieces of cardio equipment could use some maintenance (especially the spin bike). The room was stylish and spacious, and the AC did a great job of keeping the room very cool during the hot Texas summer. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the shower head, which I loved the so much that I'm getting one for my own shower at home. The bed was on the firmer side, which isn't necessarily to my liking, but the pillows and linens were very comfortable. Throughout my stay, WiFi, both in the room, in public spaces, and in the conference area, was reliable and fast.In all honesty, I've been loyal to another hotel group for a few years now, but my experiences at a couple of Marriott properties this past year, especially here at the JW Marriott Austin, has me considering shifting programs. I look forward to staying here for a future vacation trip to the area."
5,Great Property,"Excellent quality of service, nice lounge, friendly workers. Two onsite restaurants were very good, medium priced. The facility handled our convention without any issues. Plenty of walkable options for food and entertainment."
5,JW Mariott Austin,JW is centrally located and in easy walking distance of most restaurantsyou may wish to dine at though the Marriott as excellnet restaurants and bars to meet at. Overall would rate JW as five out of five
5,"WOW, just WOW!!!","A great 4 day stay, an incredibly popular place, with great staff and exciting activities right outside the door, located in the perfect location to all Austin has to offer. Rooms, pool, fitness center all top notch, clean, well cared for and open to serve."
5,Excellent stay/excellent hotel,"What a well-run operation! From check-in to check-out, staff here were so helpful and accommodating. The pool was a great time, with wonderful amenities, including a cabana, and wonderful, friendly staff. Resort feel in downtown Austin!"
5,Great stay! Just one little issue... :-),"Everything was great. I needed adjoining rooms on a high floor and they were wonderful about setting that up. Beautiful hotel, EXCELLENT customer service, great food options! I only wish they had a second (family-friendly) pool :-) The rooftop pool is definitely set up for adults. Which meant we had to get the kids in the pool early in the morning, before it got crowded. Because, it gets really busy in the afternoon with mostly grownups! Other than that, very awesome! :-)"
4,JW Marriott Austin,quite nice overall but acoustics in the lobby - at check-in and in the lobby bar - are horrendous. Find one the other nearby bars for cocktails. Rooms are fine. Easy in/out with plenty of room for car services and helpful valet staff.
5,Medical Conference Stay,We had a wonderful stay. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. I feel like everyone went above and beyond with their hospitality. I would definitely recommend this property and plan on staying at other JW Marriott properties in the future.
5,Always A wonderful stay!,"The JW Austin has always proven to be a service oriented property ensuring its guests needs are fully met. This property boasts amazing views, extended lounge hours, always popular pool and complete and spacious gym.I have always enjoyed every stay ever complete here and is still my favorite property to book in Austin.Also, the in house home made cookies are addicting!!"
5,Great Service,"Valet and Bell service was excellent. Front Desk service met us at the door and registered us quickly and answered all our questions promptly advising us of the features and amenities. Room was large and attractive, and bed was very comfortable. Fifth floor lounge was exceptionally nice and the staff made us feel welcome. Overall all interaction with Hotel staff was excellent."
4,A little side trip on our way home,"Wow! From the moment you step in until the moment you leave, you will not find a nicer staff, gorgeous rooms and everything is so clean. If we needed something, it was done right away. The only downside is the pool as it is not for a family with small kids after 11am...don't even try. Way too many hipsters (even pool staff) that look at you like your kids are carrying the plague and might splash their perfectly done hair. You wouldn't want to get in that water anyways as it got so cloudy by the end of the day as people used it as their own personal toilet. Yuck. We watched the water turn as our room had a pool view. Other than that, this hotel is everything and more. You won't be sorry. Just steer clear of the pool."
5,Great Hotel and Good Location for Walking,"This hotel was very nice with a spacious room. View overlooking pool area and Lady Bird Lake. Bathroom was large and counter space in bathroom was more than ample. Room had a nice size closet and nice size desk. Hotel lobby was beautiful and nice hotel bar area in the lobby. Elevators were quick. Hotel was kept clean and beds were comfortable. Easy check in and out, and valet car service was very efficient. Hotel was close to the convention center and close to the Congress Ave bridge, nice walking to area attractions. Would definitely stay at this hotel again."
5,I Thoroughly Enjoyed My Stay,"This is definitely a nice property and the staff was very welcoming. I want to highlight that Olga made my stay extra special with her attention to detail and care! I told Olga that this was a solo trip for me and that I was excited to see Austin’s nightlife, and she made sure to provide me a map of recommended places, as well as an extra special treat that she had sent to my room."
2,Not impressed,"Stayed here for a professional conference and I'm really not happy with the experience. I booked a room with two queen beds for my coworker and myself 3.5 months in advance as part of the conference block. When we got there we were told that the hotel was sold out and therefore we had been moved to a room with one king bed and a roll-away cot. (We were assured that we were getting a ""lake view"" instead. Yeah, being able to look 1000 feet to the left and vaguely see some kayakers really didn't make up for sleeping on a cot all week.) I asked for parking access when I checked in ($39/day for self parking, mind you) and had to go back to the front desk and ask again the next day when I couldn't get out of the garage with my key. Took at least three tries to swipe my card every time I got in the elevator to get up to the room. And then at checkout, although they charged us the correct amount overall, they didn't divide the charges correctly between our cards. Working for a government entity, even a small discrepancy like this is a pain to reconcile. The hotel is very nicely furnished, clean, well maintained, and the actual conference experience was good. But I would expect a hotel of this caliber not to have so many problems. All I can say is, I'm glad I wasn't paying out of pocket. Next time an org I belong to has a conference here I'll stay elsewhere."
5,JW Marriott Austin was excellent,"JW Marriott was tremendous for our family vacation to Austin. Rooms, Pool Area, Executive Lounge, and staff all excellent. Great location relative to restaurants and sites of Austin. We will defiantly stay at this location again."
3,Fourth of July,"So this was our second stay at this property. I was not impressed. I called in advanced to ask if we could see the fireworks from this location. I was given a most assured yes. We could not see it but for a small glimpse through 2 of the buildings, on the bottom part of the pool deck and not from the pool or our room which we were told we could do.The downstairs restaurant though was yummy!but it was an hour wait fornhamburgers and fries and the order wasn't right.The next morning (we are platinum members) the club lounge had too many people in it so that they kept running out of coffee, etc. They finally put someone at the door to check guests but that should of happened when it opened. I don't mind that there were lots of people there what I minded was the rudeness of extra people and then a shorted staff.I just feel that this location could have done a much better than this. Staffing should never be an issue at a hotel like the JW especially during a holiday. This company's focus is in hospitality and the experience. Offer overtime and staff better otherwise the experience is not the most pleasant."
5,TAB2019 Stay,"Traffic in downtown Austin is tricky. We ran into a couple of ""you can't there from here"" scenarios. However, once we pulled in and checked the car with the valet, the rest of the stay was a breeze. There are so many wonderful restaurants inside and around the hotel there was no need to drive again until we left. I attended a conference held in the hotel. The conference facilities were spacious and better than what I expected. The presentation rooms were comfortable, and the audio and video worked flawlessly. My family accompanied me and enjoyed the hotel amenities: pool and executive lounge. The front desk even provided earplugs for the kids since, apparently, I snore quite loudly! The staff was courteous and prompt. Great job, JW!"
5,First Class,We were treated as royalty as soon as we entered the building. The JW has a great location and excellent service. The staff was always eager to please! I can't recommend the J W Marriot - Austin any more highly.
5,Great Business Hotel with Amazing Service,"I arrived in Austin for a three-day conference. From the moment I arrived, the staff was so attentive and helpful. Paula at the front desk was cheery and very informative. Paula even walked me to the elevators to make sure I knew which bank to go to. I was upgraded to an Executive Suite, with incredible views of the river. My room was cleaned and really done well during the entire stay, Theresa at the Executive Lounge was very helpful and attentive to me and my guests. Whenever I had a question or forgot something, the staff was at my door within two minutes. Excellent location and great people."
1,Nothing special.,Just not the same as it used to be. Still having problems with my bill. Somehow 2 nights in hotel equals 4 nights with valet. Just big disappointment. Keys stop working twice. USB near bed didn’t work.
5,"""Jewel of Downtown Hotels""",Great hotel good employee's. Beautiful rooms Good restaurants Nice Staff. Love the pool. Easy Hotel to find in the Downtown Area. Check in is easy Breezy . Breakfast was great! Room was Great. The Hotel Lobby is well appointed and welcoming.
4,Best in Downtown Austin,Beautiful rooms. Good restaurants. Nice staff. Wish there were better breakfast options. Love the pool - although watch out for the sun from around 1p - 3p in August as it can get very intense. This is Texas of course.
5,Jewel of Downtown Hotels,"first, with Austin growing so fast it is hard to find any hotel right downtown, but I found this hiotel quickly. Plenty of parking even though parking is $50 bucks a night(am I in Manhattan?)! Check in is easy breezy plenty of friendly staff to accommodate the weary traveler. Room are great! In the executive lounge was disappointed, staff had to pour your drink, no honor bar here, asked for a vodka martini and was told they had no vermouth or olives(?)Breakfast was great in the executive lounge scrambled eggs, and bacon along with bagels and lox, many fresh fruit choices! The hotle lobby is well appointed and welcoming on and off elevators are a breeze. Even with 104 degrees outside rooms and lobby were cool as a cucumber! Will be back next time I am in town!"
4,Very nice!,"I attended a conference and this was one of the best stays I've had in a while. One of the plugs wasn't working so they took care of that. The room was nice and cleanThe laundry service was good the one day I used it. The chilaquiles for breakfast, as well as their granola, were fantastic. I even had a nice view of the river. While waiting for the airport shuttle, we were given cold water. So very nice."
2,Amenities Missing,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights for a business convention that was also at this hotel and even with advance purchase and a “group” rate, we paid well over $225 per night. Our room was a basic room with a king sized bed. We did not ask for any special amenities. We were assigned a room on the 32nd floor. Check-in was pleasant with a friendly staff and bell service. But parking here is ridiculously expensive ..... $39 per day if you park your car in their garage or $49 per day if you valet your car. So almost another $80-$100 on top of the $450 for 2 nights? Yikes!!! Then, I discover there is no in-room refrigerator where I can chill bottles of water, soft drinks, wine, beer or snacks I brought with me. Just their way of forcing you to eat and drink in their restaurants, I guess. And if you want ice, you have 2 options: you can (1) call the concierge and ask for ice ..... wait 30-45 minutes for it to be delivered to your door and pay the bell person a $3-$5 tip or (2) you can leave your room and take the elevator to the 5th floor to the “guest ice station” ..... where you will find small bags of ice (free) and then troop back up to your room. Really? I’m on the 32nd floor. No ice machines on each floor or even every other floor? Come on.... it’s Austin, Texas where it is over 100 degrees daily May - September. My advice? Check out all the amenities that are important to you before you book your stay in downtown Austin. Maybe all the hotels there are like the JW Marriott. But hopefully NOT."
5,Awesome Stay,"Stayed here for 5 days for a convention. Hotel is beautiful, service is first class, and the room was comfortable. The only drawback is, that I shared the room with someone, and upon checkout I wasn't able to get a receipt for my half with my name on it. The clerk seemed unable to do that for me. I'll contact the corporate office to see if anything can be done. Other than that, my stay was awesome, and I would definitely recommend."
2,Worst Bar Experience Ever,The lobby bar in the JW Marriott may be one of the worst places I've ever been. The staff does not respect patrons nor treat them all equally and with dignity. Ruined an otherwise good stay at a JW Marriott.
5,Great hotel and facilities,Could not recommend highly enough. Great facilities and service food choices very good happy hour options excellentVery hot when we were there air conditioning worked very wellPool area very good potential for the pool to be larger in size
5,Convenient and clean,Convenient location to Convention center. Pool area was nice. Rooms big and clean and nicely decorated. Service staff were all friendly. Starbucks and Fed Ex in the building was very convenient. Great value.
5,Conference attendance,"Standard Marriott hospitality and service - Excellent. The concierge room was very nice, convenient, and well staffed. The food was also well prepared and presented in an inviting manner. The staff were friendly and performed very well."
4,"Great for adults, ok for families","Great location and I simply love JW hotels. However, we’ve stayed at this one multiple times with our kids (6&12) and it’s ok with them. The pool is super small. During the weekend it’s crammed with early 20’s/30’s crowd from 11-around 7 pm. They don’t have family activities like some JW resorts do. That being said, there’s a lot to do with kids around this area ofAustin. If you’re looking for a great hotel to just sleep and maybe take a late night swim with the fam, this is great. I prefer the new Fairmont hotel for families."
5,Scentsy convention,Excellent location to the convention center. Great view from the room and pool was amazing. Overall the stay was great. Close to a lot of good food and sights. Easy to get to from interstate and staff was very helpful.
5,Excelent service and great location,"My experience in this hotel was excellent from the beginning of my visit. The staff was very kind and patient as I had issues with my credit card at the reception. I really enjoyed the fancy decoration of the reception and the big spaces at the conference center. I made use of the business center to get some deliveries and they were very kind and helpful. Finally, my room was clean and with a great view of the downtown area. Had a lot of space and was quiet so I could work during my stay."
5,Conference stay,"The staff are very attentive to the needs of guests, eager to satisfy, which I appreciated as I had forgotten several things. In spite of the crowdedness sometimes of the lobby, they managed to serve guests in good time."
5,My First time in Austin.,"The staff made me feel right at home, superior service and attention to my every need. The JW Marriott is a beautiful property and conveniently located to all the wonderful places Austin has to experience."
4,Fantastic Location,"Being right in the heart of downtown Austin is wonderful. You are close to the convention center, shopping, dining, hike/bike trails, and the bridge with the bats. The rooms are a good size with lots of local decor touches. The bathroom amenities smell incredible. Ladies need disposable makeup remover towelettes but love having cotton swabs and cotton balls.The Valets need some more training however. When we arrived they just stood there standing around talking instead of greeting us. Next day they brought the wrong car. Finally when it was time to leave and I’m standing around once again waiting for my car and being ignored by the valets again because they are too busy talking with each other. I have stayed here several times and not had this problem before, but definitely an area of improvement currently."
5,A Wonderful Hotel of Many Layers,"The second largest JW Marriott in the world, this hotel will be a one-stop shop whether you are on business or leisure. At least 4 eateries are here and priced well. The pool area is especially satisfying as it is literally an ""edge"" infinity pool with full raise-your-flag-like-at-the-Ritz service. Staff is attentive and wants to make your experience excellent. A great hotel in downtown Austin, within walking distance of many, many restaurants."
5,PepsiCo HR Team Meeting,"Thank you for the Great Rate We appreciated the service and the timing of getting everything coordinated. Really Hope we can utilize this facility in the near future, as a meeting space.Ashley Groggins"
5,Problem with check in,I had a room reserved for a business meeting in Austin. When I arrived I was told that the hotel overbooked and they would provide me a room at a nearby Westin. They would also give me points on my Marriott card. I went to the Westin and they said they used all rooms that were reserved for Marriott but if I go back to Marriott they would have a room for me. I walked back to Marriott with my luggage in extremely hot weather. The manager was very nice and gave me a nice room and said I would still get my points for the inconvenience. When I went to the front desk in the morning to check out I was told there was no notice of me getting points. I was expecting a call from someone and it is now several days later and I received no call. I own Marriott time shares in Hawaii and Palm Springs. I have a high rating on Marriott credit card and am disappointed in the way this matter has been handled.
5,Top Notch,"From check-in to check-out, there was never one complaint. This is an amazing hotel... full of all the little touches, customer service and cleanliness. We stayed in the executive suite thanks to my husband’s status, and it was the nicest room. The shower was so wonderful that we are looking to replace our shower head at home with the one at the JW."
5,Austin's Pride,"The location of the JW Marriot in downtown Austin Texas is exceptional to say the least. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The facilities are first class by any standard, and the location is more than you could ask for"
5,Amazing place to stay,Amenities were superb. Super clean and luxuriously comfortable. Conference rooms and staff were incredible and the location is perfect for a short or extended stay. In the heart of everything that is Austin.
5,Outstanding hotel and staff,"From the moment I arrived, it was clear the hotel was clean, modern, and beautifully maintained; and staff eager and able to help. Food offerings at the hotel and in the vicinity were also excellent. Room was clean, modern, and quiet, so sleep was great. Internet was also good, even for VPN.One thing could be improved: For those of us who prefer cola to coffee, it would be most helpful to provide vending machines on each floor -- or every few floors, at least. This would avoid the need to take a trip to the lobby store and purchase through the front desk every time we want such a drink."
5,Best weekend ever,I went to a weekend conference. Everything was so nice. The pool area was Devine. I barely got out of the hotel. Restaurants were so good ( best Mac n cheese I’ll ever had!!) all employees were super repectful. Even the valet have us water while we waited for our Uber. And the cherry on top was the Starbucks!!!
5,Great time! Fun weekend getaway!,We had great weekend getaway! Hotel was great! Fun Pool Deck! Great location Downtown! Close to everything. Good food and bar at the Corner Restaurant. 5th Floor executive eating area was convenient. Will go back!
5,JW,I’ve never been to a location where the staff was so friendly just waiting to help you. We arrived and we were going to self park but we couldn’t as the valet line on the ramp had stopped yet the valets took care of my truck just to ease our parking experience.
5,Great service,The hotel was beautiful with a great location. Check in was fast and friendly. They went the extra mile to try and get our parties separate reservations close to each other on the same floor. Executive lounge was very nice.
5,Excellent place,"Excellent location, friendly staff and always available, great rooms and views, you really feel in paradise, close to everything and you can walk anywhere. The food is really good and the prices in the are very affordable, overall loved the place"
5,Great Marriott Experience,Everything was great. Upon Check-in I was walked to the elevators by the desk assistant and during the walk explained where all the restaurants Fed Ex center and pool was located. Amazing customer service. The general manager should be proved of this Marriott.
5,Weekend Getaway,"Decided to head to Austin for a weekend getaway. We expected a J.W. property to excel in service, courtesy, and accommodations. We were not disappointed. Excellent location to hit the night life, fine dining, the lake or even to stroll down to the South Congress area. We would definitely stay there again."
5,I Didn't Want To Leave,"The staff was friendly and helpful LITERALLY from the moment I walked through the doors, including being walked to the elevator by the desk agent that checked me in. A special thank you so much to my ""conference wife"" (housekeeping) who made me feel so at home without feeling like my privacy was violated. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. And it's a good thing I couldn't fit the shower in my luggage!!! My favorite part of the whole trip to Austin!"
5,Perfect stay,"Hotel is great, service is outstanding, restaurant options offer great variety and the location can't be beat. Would definitely stay again and the brand did a great job of living up to the weight that JW carries."
5,Excellent visit and hotel,"Visited the hotel for a conference nearby and it was exactly as I'd expect a JW to be. The service was perfect, outstanding food/drink options and near all main attractions including 6th street. Having someone in the lobby at all times to assist visitors was a great touch and they took care of me when I made a few requests during my visit. Definitely would stay again."
5,"Beautiful Hotel, Great location","The staff was very helpful and friendly. They let me check in early and gave me late check out without a problem. The rooms and hotel itself is clean and up to date, they even have a starbucks right off their lobby on the 2nd floor. Great location, close to Lady Bird, 6th st, Rainey st and South Congress."
4,JW Marriott Austin Review of Stay for Bb World 2019,"Overall, my stay at the JW was very pleasant. The staff was efficient, courteous, professional, and friendly. My interaction was limited as I spent most of my time at the conference. However, the interactions I did have with staff was positive. I really appreciated that.The location was good in relation to the conference center. The weather was great and that helped a lot as I was walking back and forth. There were also plenty of places within walking distance to visit.My room was on the 24th floor and had a nice view of the river. That was lovely. The room was nice, clean. I did have two minor issues...the plug in the bathroom kept tripping. At first I was able to reset the outlet, but towards the end of the week, it would not stay set. I have no idea why it kept tripping. I did not have more than one item plugged in at a time. I had to use a plug in the room itself on the last morning to dry my hair as I could not get the outlet to work.The other minor issue was that the toilet seemed to ""run"" every 5 or 7 minutes. It was like the tank was maybe losing some water and it had to refill it a bit. Not sure if that is what it was supposed to do or not. It was not a problem, just something that I noticed."
4,BbWorld 2019,"Very clean, nice hotel. I just had a few issues/comments:I didn't like that I was unable to watch Netflix on the television.The TV remote would not turn the TV on and off. It would only work to adjust volume, change channels, etc. I even stood right in front of the TV to try and troubleshoot and nothing would work.On the last morning of my stay, I could not get the shower to turn on. The lever would not budge. I normally would have called to have someone fix it but I was short on time so I didn't."
5,a relaxing mid week away,"From check in to check out the staff at this property was top notch. I only wish that there were better beer options for the pool deck, or be allowed to bring other beers from different establishments on property. Tried all the restaurants, great food and thank you Chef for plating the beef carpacio on a regular plate not the togo cardboard. You should be very pleased with your entire team. We had a great experience, and will be back."
5,A great place to stay,"This is one of the best property to stay. I am a Marriott Titanium member, and I use many different properties around the world. This hotel offers comfort from the service to room amenities to location. I will return next time when I visit Austin."
5,Austin in Summer,"Great hotel with exceptional service and attention from the hotel staff. Perfectly prepared room; clean, well-lighted, good desk to work from. Food in the hotel restaurants was excellent and not expensive considering it's Austin. They even made me a pizza in the afternoon which was NOT on the menu! Loved the place."
5,The Best Marriott Experience,The absolute best Marriott experience I have ever had! The level of professionalism from EVERY employee was amazing. If I am ever in the area again I look forward to staying here! The gym is the absolute best too!
5,Austin,"Wonderful Hotel- great service, great food, wonderful staff and stylish rooms and property. As a business travel this is a place you will appreciate. Feels like home away from home. The club is top notch."
4,"Comfortable, attentive, benefits","Stayed 5 nights for Meetings at the convention center. The management & staff were very friendly and attentive. The lounge for Marriott Rewards members is wonderful. Nice breakfast selection, evening appetizers and beverage snack during the day. The staff did a good job with our room, however if you want to make sure your room is cleaned between certain hours, it's good to schedule this. Marriott offers this service, I would most definitely stay here again."
3,Not so impressed,The facility was nice but I found the overall experience a bit pretentious. The staff was helpful. The room was clean and spacious. The bed was not the most comfortable. I don't know what else to say but I need to have 200 characters.
5,Most wonderful service ever,"In my 30 plus years of trveling I have to say this was the best. I was greeted at the front door by Desk manager, Joshua, I had a meeting that lasted 4 days. I spoke with the general manager, Mr. Blalook and thanked him for hiring a superb staff to care for me as guest. I also would be remiss if I didn't point out the excellent cleaning room attendant, Erika. Her kindness and detail to my room needs was extremly appreciated. My overall advice to those who visit Austin, is to stay at this the Marriot JW and experience the stellar service. A special thanks to Josh and Erika!!"
5,Wonderful Experience,"Staff were very courteous and eager to help with anything. They were very attentive and engaged. Housekeeping staff were courteous and provided any needed amenities, with a smile. The staff that worked the conference area was great also."
5,"Beautiful hotel, comfy bed","I stayed at the JW Marriott while attending a conference there in Austin. The staff was always helpful and I was impressed with both the guest rooms and conference side of the hotel. The best part, though was the comfy bed after a long day of lectures and networking."
5,Really enjoyed this hotel,Very well run hotel. Stayed for 5 days during a recent conference. Rooms were nicely laid out and quiet. Exercise room was very nice -- really encouraging use of facilities. Conference rooms worked out well for the conference. Most staff were very helpful.Very happy with the hotel.
5,Feels like home,The JW Austin is top notch and so comfortable. The staff are friendly and accommodating in every department. Thanks again for a great home away from home! I always look forward to my twice yearly stays at the JW Austin!
4,Thank you for correcting the parking fees!,"We came to town for a convention and when I found out that I would have to pay to park I was not happy. I called and Jenna the manager helped me with a solution, I was not upset about the parking only that I did not know of the cost prior to booking the reservation. Since it was a conference I assumed that there was plenty of parking for free. So Jenna offered a $40 comp in food to cover one of the day stays which was reasonable.When we arrived the self parking was closed and I confirmed on the phone and in person that valet was my only option for the weekend and was assured that I would get charged that self parking day rate. When I checked out that was not the case and I was charged the full valet rate. I talked to Mateo at the front desk and he waived the charges completely, which I was grateful for.My only suggestion is to work out a paid rate that is included in the room rate for the convention folks regardless of any parking contract or not.Chris Walker512 923 5112"
5,Weekend Getaway,"We had some shopping to do in Austin and decided to just stay over Saturday and Sunday to take in the city. This hotel is in the heart of downtown Austin with great shopping and restaurants all within walking distance. We enjoyed a nice dinner at OP with great service and the food was excellent. Hotel accommodations were outstanding, and the room was very clean. We had a nice view of the lake which added to the romantic weekend we enjoyed at the JW Marriott Austin."
5,"Excellent overall, just a minor issue with communication","The hotel is beautiful, in a great location & well run. When I checked in, I asked if I could have a checkout time later than 11am since my flight wasn't until 5:45pm. They said they could give me until noon. But the morning of my departure when I called the front desk to confirm my noon checkout -- I was told it was not possible. Just wish someone from the hotel would have initiated a call to me to let me know."
5,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff.","I was at this hotel for a work conference and can not say enough about how awesome it was. Clean, well appointed and comfortable. Great downtown location. Loved The Corner outdoor bar - food was great enjoyed the casual outdoor seating. Julie at the concierge was especially helpful."
4,Sunday Dinner,"We had dinner at JW Marriott, and it was delicious. We were able to get a seat quickly, and our food and drinks were delivered quickly too. Our server was Emma T, and she was delightful!!! Would definitely go again."
2,Two strikes,"Their on property store is such a rip off it floored me when I received my bill. For instance, Haribo gummies were $6. You have to be kidding me. The TV in our room was so dim, I could barely see it with the black out shades drawn. They sent a person up to assess who then told me they needed to send another person with a remote up. Just bring the remote. This cannot be a unique issue with me."
5,Awesome Family Friendly Hotel,"We attended a conference of the International Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Foundation. A family friendly reunion that brings together researchers, clinicians & OCD sufferers. This hotel was the perfect location with family friendly features like the outdoor pool, restaurants that satisfied everyone's palate & were reasonably priced and quick to get in and out of. We've attended 4 of these conferences and this was by far the best venue."
5,Summer stay in Austin,"Our four day stay in Austin was phenomenal! Loved the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We were able to check-in before noon. All of our needs were met. The convention space was spectacular. The food was very, very good, though some selections were on the pricey side. We would definitely stay there again. We felt safe and extremely well taken care of!"
5,Great Experience,"Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Staff is extremely friendly and professional. Overall a great experience and a great place to stay. Central to the Austin Convention Center, as well as dining, shopping and nightlife."
5,Great Stay,"I was at your hotel for a conference but it felt like a holiday. My room was spacious and modern with every amenity possible. I asked for ice without calling and then told the room maid that I would call as I recalled it said on card to do so-I came back to find ice in my bucket which meant the maid went above and beyond her duties to make me feel comfortable. I enjoyed each of the restaurants and found the employees to be welcoming and making sure my every need was met.However, not centrally located towards a shopping district though plenty of restaurants abounded."
5,Great time at JW Marriott,"We had an excellent stay. My wife and I often find the cost is not commiserate with the service. For the service we got, it felt like the cost was a bargain. The wait staff at the pool, especially Teresa were wonderful!"
5,A Great Venue for a Conference,"The room was roomy; the bed was very comfortable; the walk-in shower was fantastic; and the food in the restaurant, Corner Star, was amazing! (I’d like to get the recipe for the chicken chili.) The only drawback: room service was a bit pricey."
4,Business Stay,I was greeted by the front desk very friendly and professionally. I was quickly checked in to my 24th floor room. The bathroom was beautiful and the bed very comfy. Everything was very clean. I didn't get a chance to eat or drink in the hotel but it looked very good.
5,Excellent Place to Stay,"I came to town for a conference located in the hotel and was very impressed with the hotel and the excellent service of the staff. They were quick to attend to any needs - really a step ahead of needs and were very friendly. The room was clean, nice views, well laid out. The hotel is in walking distance to many eating options. Highly recommend."
3,JW Marriott Austin review,No mini fridge or microwave. Issues with bathroom sink extremely slow drain and shower door or closing properly leading to water all over the floor after a shower Location was excellent. Cost was on the high side for quality of room
5,Better Inside Than Out,"This is a very nice and clean hotel. It is convenient to lots of things in Austin. When you venture outside the hotel, be prepared to be accosted by somewhat aggressive panhandlers. But inside the hotel has just about everything you need."
2,Bad Executive Lounge Breakfast,"While this location is great, the breakfast in the Executive Lounge was terrible. Powdered eggs and cold sausage at at JW? Come on, you can do better. At the regular Marriott in Metairie, LA they have real eggs. Why not at this supposedly high end hotel."
3,Nice Hotel With Many Mishaps,"It started at check-in. I requested a king and was taken to a room with two queen beds. They moved me to a nice room. I was given a voucher for my trouble. That evening I ordered nachos by room service. I waited over an hour and fell asleep. I woke up two hours later and called to inquire. They forgot my order. I was given another voucher to use in one of the restaurants. I used one of the vouchers to order nachos again for room service. They came within 90 minutes. I gave the young lady the $20 voucher plus a $5 dollar bill. The next morning I go to restaurant for breakfast to use my second voucher. My order is wrong. They take it back. The second one comes out wrong again. I give them the voucher and leave. I go to check out and the room service is on my bill. The young lady at the desk had to call two people to get it cleared up.Seems to me, if your service were better, you wouldn't have to give out so many vouchers."
5,Great location and staff,I really enjoyed the staff and location durning my short stay. I was able to walk to the convention center and state capital. The staff was very helpful with recommendations. The hotel was modern and impressed those that were with me.
5,Excellent Downtown Hotel,The JW Marriott Austin is a modern luxury property in the heart of downtown. Excellent service and 1st class restaurants and rooms made our stay memorable. Highly recommended for business travelers and families.
5,Favorite Austin Hotel,"Accompanied my husband. He had business, I visited family. Have stayed there several times and enjoy the friendly staff, clean, stylish rooms, comfortable lobby, and especially enjoy the executive lounge."
4,Good for an extremely large hotel,"Great staff. Nice pool but small. Good restaurants. Bed was comfortable. Staff responsive to requests. Not sure it's worth the money.... it was VERY expensive. For the same money I could have stayed at the W, and next time I will"
5,Terrific place to stay in downtown Austin,"My wife and I were in Austin for a convention and stayed at this hotel. It was an outstanding experience. From the moment we checked in to when we got in our cab for the airport to go home, the staff did everything they could to make use feel special and welcome. The only negative we had was that the convention center is a few blocks away. This was only an issue in the afternoon as walking in the July heat was a bit tough...but when we arrived back at the hotel the space was cool and the beer at the bar was ice cold. We will stay at this hotel anytime we are back in Austin."
3,Quick Trip to Austin,"We decided to take a couple of day trip to Austin having not been there in quite some time. We decided to use Marriott Reward points. The JW Marriott was well located (near Congress and near the Congress St Bridge--bat zone). Room was nice--one chair, no couch. TV was a nice size. Difficult to hook up my Roku, but the tech came and helped. Room was really dark with lights off. The concierge room was less than expected--food choices weak for night and morning, cold temp, and no coke products. Valet parking was high--$50 a day. So with a 'comp-d' room our bill was still over a $100."
4,Lively Bar,"Lovely bar scene in the lobby. Friendly greeting upon checkin. The executive lounge was just ok, they serviced fried food and hunks of cheese which this Californian isn’t in to. Gym is well equipped. The rooms are good and as expected for a JW Marriott."
5,Always enjoy my stay at this wonderful hotel,Perfect location with walking distance from restaurants and music. The hotel ambiance is very inviting. The staff service from check-in to every interface is awesome. Enjoy a drink in lobby bar! the service in lobby bar is very friendly.You will truly enjoy the experience here!
5,Best hotel stay,"Going to a convention can be challenging as far as location, food,service, etc. Not at this hotel! Even the Starbucks was great! Hotel employees polite,accommodating and excellent. Banquet food was pretty good too."
5,Austin Marriott,Very nice facility. Conference area and rooms were ideal for my group's function. Staff was very focused on customer service even after check out. Location in downtown Austin is ideal for events in the area.
5,Terrific Time In Austin,"This hotel provides an all around experience of excellence. Can’t imagine a more perfect vacation stay. Walking distance to most of the popular sights, and only a short cab ride to the rest! Kudos to Jon, who greeted us as we entered the hotel, walked us to the desk, and checked us in. Jon helped familiarize us with the area, suggested music venues, restaurants, and was genuinely interested in our satisfaction. Marriott is fortunate to have such a fine goodwill ambassador."
5,Great hotel in a perfect Downtown Location!,"Spent two excellent nights at this JW located right in the heart of Austin! Staff across the board was phenomenal and helpful! You will walking distance to all Austin has to offer but you really don’t need to leave the property if it’s too hot out for ya! Nice pool area with a great staff or bartenders and servers to help keep ya cool! Multiple restaurants on main level both a high quality food at the gastropub(ish) Corner restaurant or hit up the delicious Italian offerings at the OP restaurant! One of the nicest Executive Lounges with some of the best offerings I have seen in a long time.. not your traditional fried options for appetizers and well stocked refreshments. Very nice sized fitness center and what appears to be a popular spa! Highly recommend, well done JW Marriott Austin!"
5,"Great accommodations, excellent service, very nice facilities.","The hotel service was excellent, very clean and modern, great location, and the amenities were very nice (pool, fitness, outdoor patio, etc.). Hotel staff was incredibly responsive and kind. My only (and very small) issues were that the keycard had trouble working in the elevator sensors (hotel door worked fine) and no fridge in room (dietary restrictions make that useful)."
5,"Outstanding service, vibe and decor!","First I was greeted by the front desk staff with a smile and escorted to the desk for checkin! Wow! I enjoyed the look and feel of the decor - not too modern just enough! My front desk receptionist also walked me with my bag to the elevator. Wow! Getting to the elevator can be confusing so that was very helpful. Finally I was thrilled by the sound of good music and lots people gathered in the open bar area! Not a big drinker but it was nice to see people enjoying the company of their friends or colleagues in the hotel! Staff were very helpful, responsive and respectful!"
5,Enjoying 4 days in Austin,"Everyone who works at the JW was friendly and helpful. Jon checked us in and became a friend to us. He helped us with reservations, and gave us great advice about music venues. He really made our vacation special! Our room was clean and quiet. The restaurants in the hotel were great, good food and drinks. Special thanks to Jon, we see a great future for you at the JW, you deserve it."
4,Nice conference location,"Good location in downtown Austin. Walkable to most key locations in the entertainment district, however, Austin has a large homeless challenge that must be addressed to sustain itself as a destination location."
5,Enjoyed my stay,In town for a work conference that was located in the JW Marriott. It was very convenient and honestly i never left the hotel until i departed. We were served catered breakfast lunch and dinner by JW Marriott and everything was delicious. All the staff i encountered were very helpful. Hotel and rooms were very nice and room was very comfortable.
5,Please move the conference chairs apart a few inches!!!,"From front desk service, food, housekeeping to internet connection...everything was great. The only suggestion that I will make is PLEASE space the chairs a few inches apart in the conference area. I am not a large person and felt totally squished in those seats. Many people opted to sit on the floor rather than squeeze between two other people in a seat. Some people even sat on two seats together. It was totally claustrophobic. I have never experienced that at a conference location before."
5,It was great!,"I highly recommend this property! It is everything we expected and more. The entire staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and we will surely choose this hotel when we return to Austin! The restaurants on site were great too. Again, the wait staff was friendly and the food was delicious. Try the ""three dips and chips"" starter....."
4,Nice stay with one minor annoyance,"Beautiful hotel and rooms. Staff was super friendly and helpful. And the location was prime; within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to see and the convention hall.Only reason we give 4 stars is because you can hear the rooftop club music late into the night. Just hard to relax in your room after a long night when you hear drunk people singing along to music outside your room. We get it, they were enjoying themselves too. But we were jet lagged and hot and just wanted to rest before the next days activities.Aside from that, it was a perfectly delightful trip! Would stay again but would ask ti be as far away from the club as possible. 😄😁"
4,Conference Stay in Austin,"Pros: Great location, easily accessible to all that Austin has to offer. Very friendly staff, especially the bell hops! Plenty of restaurant options for business trips that have short lunch breaks.Cons: I was assigned a handicap accessible room and the shower was a mess every time I used it. The floor did not drain properly, causing water and suds to end up every where. The hotel's website says overnight self-parking is $30, however I was charged $39 and they did not honor the discrepancy, but gave me a conference rate instead. The room cards allow access to the floors from the elevator, but didn't consistently work, so I always hoped someone else with a working card was on the elevator. The parking garage smelled like trash and pot, which made the cost and walk rather unpleasant."
5,3 Nights in Austin,"We were in town to assist our son in his move to another city. The JW NEVER disappoints. From Valet to check out was perfect. The hotel was quiet at night and very comfortable. Housekeeping was excellent and took care of all our needs. When we arrived we were greeted, and walked to the elevator. The hotel is immaculate. This is the place to stay while in Austin."
2,Took 20 hours and 5 phone calls to get someone to unclog the toilet.,"The hotel was nice. The staff was friendly, but for some reason when I called to get the toilet unclogged, they kept saying ""I was in the system and someone was coming"". No one came.I called again, same response.I called the next morning (12 hours later). Same. I let them know it had been 12 hours. I went to my conference, and came back. Still clogged.The room was clean, but toilet was clogged. I called again, and let them know it had almost been 24 hours, which is crazy. Someone came 30 minutes later. So for 20 hours I had no toilet in my room. That's horrible service."
5,Elegant hotel,"The hotel location is perfect few minutes walk from several attractions and restaurants.Front desk staff are very professional and pleasant. They managed the overwhelming clients attending the PAA and checking in a very short time.The room was missing a fridge but when I asked, it was delivered to my room in a timely manner.The restaurant where breakfast is served is very elegant and staff are very friendly."
5,David is awesome!,"This Austin hotel has never let us down. It was, once again, an amazing stay. I was honored to meet David and talk to him every day. He made himself available to every guest and took care of us as if we were family. Amazing customer service!!"
4,Great visit for RTX 2019,"Larger Fridge would be beneficial vs small ""college mini fridge"" - cheaper parking garage rate with room booking would be great as well where as I already pay 200 a night. Outside that, service was great from all the staff."
5,As Always...Simply Amazing,"Centrally located, the JW Marriott is the perfect hub for exploring downtown Austin. Just a simple stroll in any direction will give you an amazing amount of sites, activities, restaurants and interesting people watching. My wife and I love to stay here and walk around Lady Bird Lake, then spend the rest of the day trying new eateries and bars. The Marriott always provide an amazing place to stay with many great options available without having to even leave the property."
5,Stephanie,"JW Marriott Austin was amazing after we met Josh Brown who made us feel so welcomed after having a terrible time in the city .You found the kindest , most genuine man to represent your brand when you hired Josh . His smile can light the entire room . Every time we walked by he was smiling and welcoming each and every guest . We were sad when we had to fly back home .We will return to Austin just to visit the JW Marriott again and be welcomed so kindly . Josh is 5 star plus plus .I don’t usually write reviews but He deserves acknowledgment and to be recognized because people like him are so few and far between . Great job Marriott finding an amazing role model ."
5,Amazing Hotel Property,"Convenient, modern and incredible service. From the time you pull up through checkout, the staff is wonderful at this property! Great location close to everything!! Clean and sizeable rooms. Would stay again in a minute!"
5,Pleased Customer,The hotel is in a great location. The customer service provided was excellent! The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to ensure I had a great stay! This was much appreciated! The hotel has great amenities and restaurants located on site. Within walking distance to nearby attractions. Would definitely recommend this hotel!
5,So friendly people,We had an issue with our credit card. It wasn't approved maybe because of several typos on the registration of the card but there was an amazing woman that helped us with so much patience. I've lost my patience before her. Really a friendly receptionist.
5,Top Class Service,The service I received at this hotel was excellent from end to end. The staff were all professional and respectful at all times. I loved the rooftop pool & the on property Starbucks as well!Thank you so much for a pleasant stay!!
5,Great staff and comfortable rooms in sight of bat bridge,"The people at the JW Marriott were always helpful. We enjoyed meals in two of the hotel restaurants, and they were both just fine. The card and elevator system took a little bit of getting used to, but that was a security measure. We did have a fire alarm go off during our stay, and did evacuate the building. It turned out to be a dirty smoke detector. You will get your steps in as you walk from one part of the hotel to the other!. Convention food was good, for the most part. We enjoyed having the optional refrigerator in the room."
5,Classy and hip hotel!,"The hotel was very chic, modern, hip, and fun. The staff is very courteous, the vibe is great, and the views are great from the higher floors. The pool isn't one where you could do laps (it's shallow and not laid out for laps at all), but it is a nice respite from the sun."
5,A very pleasant stay made special by the well trained employees.,"Our conference was 5 days and all the employees were professional, friendly and tried to meet our needs. The rooms were special. The beds very comfortable, bathrooms have great showers, towels fluffy and all the toiletries one may need or forgot were available.The only complain I would have is the breakfast menu. Descriptions fail to mention that Texmex sauces are too hot for most people not being Texan, if one happens to order chilaquiles . I mention this in particular because the 2 breakfasts served during our meetings were excellent. As well as the lunch & dinners.It is difficult sometimes to serve a perfect steak to 600 people but the ones I ate, 2< were perfect."
5,Wonderful place to stay in the heart of Austin!,Highly recommend the JW Marriott in Austin to anyone traveling for work or pleasure. Nice big rooms and beautiful views of the city. Front desk and concierge staff were all super nice and very helpful. I know this is a weird thing to note but really loved the smell of their clean towels. Did not have that strong chemical cleaning smell most hotels usually have for towels. Will definitely stay here again.
5,Great July 4th weekend,"We booked 2 rooms at the Austin JW for a July 4th getaway. This was our first time to stay here and we will be back. It is a lovely property, great pool and wonderful Executive Club. As a mature adult, I didn't think downtown would interest me, but I was wrong. Great area to explore, many restaurant choices and get on site restaurants."
5,A perfect get away,"We couldn't have been more pleased by our experience at the JW. We were celebrating a very special day as a couple and Jon - the front desk concierge - made sure that everything was perfect. Highly, highly recommend."
5,A peaceful stay during a busy convention,The room was wonderful and we had a great time staying there. Rachelle helped us check out and was super helpful and answered any questions we had. I apologise I don't remember who checked us in but they were also very helpful. We all commented on how nice the lobby looked.
5,GFWC International Conference,"Everything was wonderful, especially the folks working at the hotel.The food was great, the rooms were perfect, even sharing with 2 other women!I can't say enough about the friendliness of the hotel staff!"
5,Great conference experience,"Great location, facilities, and food! The conference staff also went above and beyond to make sure that we held a successful event. They responded to quickly to everything from needing another table to restocking refreshments to AV queries."
5,Great Property,"I spend the weekend of July 4th at this property for the last 5 years. Great hotel. The staff is very pleasant and helpful in every way. Rooms, gym, pool and restaurants are all very nice! Close to 6th street and all the action of downtown Austin"
5,GFWC International Convention,"The facility was very nice, plenty of restaurants, bars and gathering places. The pool area was also enjoyable. The hotel was close to many attractions that were in walking distance or short cab ride."
3,Service Wasn't What I Expected,"For a standard four star hotel, this Marriott was fine; however, I expect more from JW. I was disappointed. I went thru the check-in process twice (we had multiple rooms), and although the staff was professional, he and she were not welcoming. They seemed to be scrutinizing the reservation . . . I am not sure why. The process was unnecessarily long, and mistakes were made both with the rooms we reserved and with the keys they provided. I had to have my key reprogrammed multiple times during our stay. Make sure you have your ID EVERY time you step out of your room. You can't have your key fixed without it, and you can't return to your floor without a key, even to get your ID.In addition, guest services AND the front desk could not provide accurate information of the exec lounge hours on two consecutive days. When I questioned the hours on July 5th, I was told in a snarky tone, ""Well, it's Friday, so it closed at 9:00AM,"" (It didn't). Pool was nice, but small and very crowded due to the holiday. Ya, I probably won't go back. PS - Manager in the Exec Lounge was awesome. Wish he had been at the front desk."
5,Amazing stay. Perfect location. Friendly and helpful staff. Great lobby. Comfortable rooms. Good dining.,"I stayed at the JW Marriott for 6 nights for a conference and this being the official hotel as well as venue decided to stay here. I had just stayed at the San Francisco JW Marriott the previous month, my first stay at the JW brand, and found myself underwhelmed (see my review) relative to my expectations. I had stayed at other Marriott properties during my other travels but never at a JW; nor was I a member of the rewards program. My decision to stay at another JW property was one of convenience but, just as at San Francisco, I still had high expectations when I made the booking. I had made this reservation in Austin well before my stay at the San Francisco property and, after my experience there, had already lowered those expectations by the time I visited Austin.Congratulations JW Marriott Austin for making a believer of me!I became a member of Marriott Rewards - now Bonvoy - because of you. It begins and ends with the staff. Upon entry into the lobby the reception was straight ahead and a staff member greeted me and directed me to their colleague who checked me in both a friendly and efficient fashion. Upon subsequent interactions with the front desk and the concierge I was always greeted in genuinely friendly manner. I was never made to feel I was inconveniencing the staff and they were ready to help, not that I presented them with any difficult challenges. On my last day the young lady manning the concierge table was a trainee from Italy who also did an excellent job.The lobby was large, stairs/escalators to the ballrooms immediately to the left followed by the concierge desk and then the lobby entrance to the Corner (Star) restaurant. As mentioned the reception was directly ahead. The elevators to the room as well as the other restaurant, Osteria Pronto were to the far right. The lobby bar was immediately to one’s right upon entering. There were couches for visitors to sit on while waiting for their ride or to check in/out on busy mornings. There was even an umbrella/towel stand where staff would help keep guests dry or towel off during a rain shower. Speaking of water there were usually 2 large glass water dispensers on wood tables in the middle of the lobby to refresh returning guests.The elevators featured the increasingly-common security feature of needing to swipe one’s room card over the sensor to access the floor button.The hallways were bland. My room was modern, sleek, clean and spacious. I had a good view of the Colorado River; this was the Texas Colorado, not the more famous Colorado River of Grand Canyon fame. While the furnishings may have been generic I appreciated the obvious efforts to tie-in the location; the wall decor included a framed poster stating “Austin”, a stylized printed of the skyline reflected in the river and a city map. The bathroom was of a decent size; there was a large shower stall, no bathtub. Closet space was good. The bed was comfortable and I slept well every night. The numerous outlets and USB ports at the desk as well as on the bedside tables were much appreciated. The room was high enough to filter out noise from the fairly busy Congress Avenue below.Talking of Congress Avenue, this hotel was extremely well-located for anyone inclined to walk around the downtown. The river was just 2 blocks to one’s left after exiting the lobby; I made a point to try watch the daily spectacle of the bats flying out from under the bridge each evening at about sunset to feed in the surrounding areas. I also managed to kayak on the river one day. There are numerous dining options within walking distance. The Texas Capitol is straight up Congress Avenue, just over 15 minutes walk away.The rooftop pool was understandably busy and was a great place to hang out, snack and enjoy cold drinks. The pool was good to lounge in and cool off, not for swimming labs. Unfortunately I did not commit to a reservation to the spa when I checked in and when I finally inquired there were no slots available for the last full day of my stay.I had drinks at the lobby bar and had dinner at both Osteria and the Corner. I enjoyed my meals at the hotel restaurants.I highly-recommend staying at the JW Marriott when visiting Austin and would stay there again if given the opportunity."
4,Great service,"Stayed here for a couple nights. Customer service was outstanding from check in, if you called the front desk to when we left. Parking/Valet price was steep. Would definitely stay here again. Super clean, super friendly."
5,Austin for RTX,We stayed over the 4th of July weekend. We had a nice trip. Our son went to to RTX and we explored Austin. Hotel was centrally locates and we walked or took an electric scooter everywhere. Nice time overall
5,Great hotel!,"Wonderful service! Didn’t feel like a typical downtown business hotel. Pool is high energy with a great view. Excellent room service and at the pool. Location was great walking distance to restaurants, bars and fun places to walk. Definitely on my return list!"
5,Family orientation at UTA,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights because we attended the family orientation at the University of Texas at Austin. We had a very good experience. The rooms are great, the pool and lounging space are beautiful, the gym is well equipped, the restaurants are excellent and the service of course is one of the best. Austin is going to be our son’s home for the next four years and we will stay at JW every time we visit."
4,4th of July week,Our kids were staying with grandparents for the week so we decided to visit Austin for a short getaway. I loved this property! Very sleek and clean. Loved the Corner Bar! The fitness center was well maintained and stocked with towels/water. And I was impressed with how the staff kept up with the mass crowds of people at the pool on the 4th (wow!) My only complaint is there was no mini fridge in our room. We had to make many trips to get ice on the 5th floor (we stayed on the 23rd floor).
5,Excellent in all ways,"All staff encountered were friendly and professional. Gym, pool and spa area are beautiful. The concierge lounge is outstanding—great food and open on weekends. I loved this hotel and can’t wait to stay there again!"
4,Great Location and Shopping,"I typically stay at Marriott hotels as I'm in their rewards program, so when I came to Austin for a job interview, I chose the JW for my lodging. The JW has lots of great shopping and eateries within walking distance and the rooms were clean and nicely appointed with a staff that is very attentive. This hotel is pricey though, but most JWs are as they Marriott's flagship properties. I was surprised that the pool was quite small, but it was clean and uncrowded. I had an enjoyable stay."
5,Nice conference location,"We stayed two nights at this hotel during a business conference. The hotel is wonderful, very clean with outstanding service. The staff there are one step above great. Very nice rooms, super nice conference rooms, and amenities."
5,Excellent hotel,"Room was in great condition and service was excellent throughout the hotel. Very nice fitness room and spa. We attended a conference here, and all the conference rooms and amenities were comfortable and very good."
3,Great staff stuck at a subpar JW,"The Austin JW Marriott staff are incredible, the hotel is very clean, and with a few changes it can become a true JW Marriott. Harley at the front desk is one of the most friendly and polite people I’ve met. She immediately thanked me for my Platinum Elite status. Although the hotel is the largest JW in North America, they were unable to offer a room upgrade—which was disappointing. I’ve seen disruptions in the upgrade and amenity experience since Marriott changed their reward and loyalty structure. At 50 nights per year to earn Platinum, it’s a bit disappointing. Instead, I was “upgraded” to a room next to the elevator on floor 26. Stay away from room numbers ending in 17—you’ll hear hallway and elevator noise all night. This was compounded by the door design. The open slats at the bottom of the door allowed sound to come in from outside. The walls were also thin and I could hear phone conversations from my neighboring room. The mattress is very firm so if that’s your thing, great. If not, you’ll need to adjust. The club lounge was staffed by great people (again a common theme at this hotel), but the offerings were sparse. Very limited breakfast options; eggs and bacon were the only hot item choices. A few yogurts and a croissant. I look forward to the Marriott Austin Downtown. Hopefully Marriott executives will take the employees from the JW and move them to the new hotel where their excellent service will equally match the new hotel. 5-stars for service. 2-stars for the physical hotel and amenities."
5,PHATS Trade show,"It was my first time in Austin, I was well received, both both check in and check out was very quick. excellent room size hats of to Edwards at the Fed Ex counter He was courteous polite and had a smile and very helpful both on the reception of my box and the shipping out.Great job...bar was a little $$$ for my taste but the drinks were god, good layout s well."
4,"Very impressive property, excellent location, great conference center","I stayed here for a rather large conference a couple weeks back. This is a visually impressive property, and the service is absolutely top notch.There are several bars and restaurants right on site. I'd recommend making your way out through the hotel restaurant and to the right, to the Burger Bar, for an excellent and reasonable burger. The lobby bar is a great setup, and was hopping. The restaurant across the lobby from the bar was also a great spot for a drink. You're also very easy walking distance to a major variety of other options.Being there for a conference, we were kind of bound by ""hotel catered food"" for most meals. I found that food to be just kind of ""eh."" That's what prompted a quick run to the Burger Bar at one point. Another disappointment was the lack of an in-room fridge.Overall, I'd definitely stay here again (if I got a deal on the price. The company paid, but it'd be tough to justify $350+/night to stay here on my own dime.)"
5,.,"JW is the best hotel in the Austin, Im so happy stay in there,The staff was very friendly and welcoming and seemed to genuinely care.Excellent Hotel and Staff, I definitely would stay at this hotel again"
5,Convention Venue,"Great downtown venue, very professional staffs. Very nice rooms, meeting and show space. Good value for location and amenities. Consierge was very helpful with my inquires on dining and other needs. A1"
5,"Nice hotel, good location",Stayed here for a conference. The hotel is very nice with a great fitness area and pool. All the restaurants are good with a nice variety of food and drinks. Convenient walk to all of downtown Austin including the convention center and Lady Bird Lake.Hotel is very busy with 1000 plus rooms so if you like quaint and quite this is not that but even with all the hustle and bustle it was easy finding room and service throughout the hotel.
3,Big and crowded,"Not my favorite. I am lifetime titanium and was disappointed with many aspects. The lounge is packed and the food in the lounge is lacking. I am guaranteed 4 pm check out but had a note on my door saying 11:00 check out , no exceptions. So not bad, not great"
5,A few days from home.,My husband had meetings that kept him busy all day. The visitor centre with many tours was close by as was a beautiful lake. We took the Hop on Hop off bus tour and It was excellent. Lady Bird Lake has very good walking and cycling trails around it.
5,Beautiful Hotel,We loved our stay at JW. Rooms were very clean & service was exceptional. It was walking distance to many nice restaurants and shopping areas. My only complaint was the rooms were not equipped with refrigerators. Loved the view from our picture window.
5,NHL Show,Super staff. Greeted with a smile each and everyday. Very good food options. Clean and friendly people staff. The rooms were awesome. I will make this place the go to place the next time I travel to Austin
5,brianpatafie.com,"The hotel was beautiful, clean and in an outstanding location in Austin within walking distances of many fine attractions. I found the food albeit expensive it was very tasty. Your staffs friendliness and attention to detail is second to none."
5,Celebrated a BIG Indian wedding there! It was an awesome experience!!!,"We loved everything about the JW Marriott.Great people, Jyll Vertuno from Sales, Mary Hayes from Event Management.They are absolutely the very best!They gave us great prices, even better service, and worked painstakingly with us and our guests on various details.The rooms were fantastic, clean, and quiet.We had a fantastic experience."
4,Great spot near convention center,"Terrific hotel with outstanding front desk service. Comfortable beds, contemporary rooms, and very good restaurants. Only reason it didn’t get five stars was because their in-house package team lost my delivered print order for 18 hours. They mishandled it causing me a sleepless night waiting for them to locate critical conference presentation materials. Otherwise a great property!"
5,Terrific stay!,"Fantastic views and great service from the moment I arrived. I was here on business but the time I was in the hotel was a joy. Even room service food, which in most hotels is subpar, was overall very good. I’ve found my new go-to hotel in Austin."
5,"Great stay, just some minor points",My stay was great. Only two issues were the television in my room (3307) would not turn on off with the remote. I had to turn it on manually with the switch in the back and off by unplugging the power. Second issue was it took a very long time before the hot water would flow. It took two and a half minutes before the shower water was warm enough to use.
5,great personal service,The service from all the staff was exceptional. Everyone was kind and helpful and friendly. The darkening shades in the rooms made sleeping in after late nights very easy. The pool and deck was lovely. for such a large hotel it was very pleasant to stay here.
5,Wedding Celebrations at J W Marriott in June 2019,"We had absolutely the most amazing time at the hotel for the stay during our daughter's wedding at the venue.The rooms were fantastic, clean, great views, and even better service!I would very strongly recommend this hotel for your celebrations and visits to Austin."
4,JW Marriott Austin,I greatly enjoyed my time at the JW Marriott Austin. All of the staff at the hotel were wonderful to work with. They were all so nice and accommodating. I definitely look forward to staying at this property again in the future!
5,Fantastic service!,"Front desk staff are amazing, shout out to Harley! Room was immaculate and view of south Austin was great. Definitely recommend the executive longe which was a great way to relax and enjoy a light snack before heading out to dinner. Second time we stayed at this property and will definitely return. Highly recommended!"
5,Lovely hotel in nice location,"Modern hotel with all the amenities you could ask for! Excellent service from front desk staff at check-in, concierge who gave directions and shopping tips, housekeeping who provided extra cookies, and Executive Lounge staff who uncorked my personal wine bottle. Had a lovely room on top floor (without asking) with a side view of the lake. Love hotels who go the extra mile!"
5,Overall excellent experience,"Excellent property and business. While the location and size were perfect for our event and training weekend, it was incredibly busy. The pool area was packed the whole time. Great facilities and restaurants. Room was comfortable, clean, and quiet."
5,Road Trip,"Definitely recommend!! JW Austin provides, phenomenal rooms, supreme customer service, stellar amenities, a great location for night life in Austin. JW Austin is an excellent choice for your weekend getaway or your business trip."
4,JW Marriott Austin,"Modern JW with nice rooms, spacious executive lounge and friendly staff. Centrally located downtown. Spacious lobby. Breakfast and evening offerings similar to other JW ECs. Happy hour had very limited menu."
5,Gorgeous & Comfortable,Enjoyed my brief stay. It was easy to get around the hotel and everything in town was nearby. Food was tasty and reasonably priced. Everyone on staff was friendly. I will return to host our society's annual conference next April and I really look forward to it.
1,RUINED MY WEEKEND!!!,"I walked into the hotel mid-afternoon to check in for a Family Rehearsal dinner & wedding the next day. I asked the guy, JON,@ the concierge desk where the check-in location was & he insisted on checking me in himself. That was My First Mistake! My family had a block of rooms & I told him it was imperative that I be near family, giving him their names. He swore to me I would be very close to them. MISTAKE #2: I gave a bellman a $10 tip to rush my bags up to my room so I could dress for the dinner, They lost my luggage.That man never showed his face again & after over an hour, a nice man came with my luggage after I threatened to call the Police. He claimed they had been trying to deliver it to 1209 (I was in 1204), but that couldn't be true because I was out in the hallway watching for my luggage constantly, I was livid. I was also LATE thanks to them. Then I found out that all the rest of my family was in a DIFFERENT TOWER, FLOORS 20-27, which also uses a different set of elevators which I was NOT ALLOWED TO ACCESS. Their rooms were the same price as mine, but theirs included a full breakfast & snacks in the afternoon. I paid $25/day for breakfast. I am PROTESTING THE CHARGE ON MY AMEX. I cannot tell you how upset I was & am. My cousins needed to borrow things from me & vice versa & we couldn't get to each other in a timely manner which made stress on everyone. This is All BECAUSE A YOUNG CONCIERGE NAMED JON WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME! AND DID WHATEVER HE FELT LIKE DOING, DESPITE MY REQUESTS. And there were other rooms in the Family Tower available. I later checked when all this came to light. JW Marriott used to be my favorite hotel. No longer. And you would think that a manager would've gotten in touch with me since I called no less than 6 times about my lost luggage. Only when I threatened to involve the police was it brought to me. I sure wish I had gotten that original bellman's name. He needs to be fired. He took my $10 and apparently hid my luggage.Yet everyone else in the OTHER TOWER got theirs quickly."
4,Great location,"Excellent service at this great spot in Downtown Austin. The room is nothing special, but extremely comfortable beds and linens. Pool on 5th floor has a great vibe but does get overcrowded on weekends. Can easily walk to multiple restaurants as well as the walking/running path around Lady Bird Lake. Complaints: poor water pressure in the shower and bathroom sink. Also, if you turned hot water on in bathroom sink it would continue to run hot after turning off the hot and turning on the cold."
5,Wonderful Stay,"My room was very nice and it had a fantastic view. The room, pool area and workout facility were clean and well maintained. The meeting rooms were nice, the meals/snacks during the meeting were delicious. It would be nice to have 'bar tables"" supplied in meeting rooms for those that would prefer to stand."
3,"Approval for Mother to be Included in Res was approved, denied, approved, denied, approved, denied, then approved","I was recently in a car accident while traveling for work, so my company offered to fly my Mother down and get her her own room (on my company credit card), so that she could keep me company as I recovered before I was cleared to fly back home. I booked her and myself at the JW Marriott Austin, hoping I could just focus on a stress-free recovery…I contacted the hotel through the app before my stay, asking if the hotel could include my mother’s reservation under my Bonvoy number, so she could get upgraded to the same floor as me and we could do breakfast together in the lounge, etc. The response was phenomenal! – “of course we can,” “your Mother is confirmed on your reservation,” etcThen I actually arrive to check in. I ask to confirm that, in fact, my mother was added to my reservation, and … they had no idea what I was talking about. “We don’t see that, sir, I’ll have to ask my Manager for approval to add your Mother under your reservation and Bonvoy number and get your benefits.""I then texted the Bonvoy App AGAIN to confirm that my Mother would be added under my Bonvoy number, so we could get same floor, breakfast together, etc etc. The response was, “Yes sir, this has been approved, and your mother was assigned a room right next to you.” Great! I thought, this has finally been resolved.Well … when I finally arrive with my Mother at 2 AM after picking her up from the airport and we check in and I ask if she was added under my Bonvoy number and had my status benefits and had the room next to mine, the check-in person said … “I’m sorry Sir, we can’t do that” ($#!@%!!!!). The check-in person asked to see the authorization from my Bonvoy app text chain (which of course wasn’t working and wouldn’t load), and then we waited for 10 minutes at 02:10 am while he tapped his fingers waiting for the app to load, and then he finally realized in the system that yes, my Mother had been added under my Bonvoy number and yes, she would have my benefits.This is frustrating enough, let alone on two different pain medications.The unfortunate thing about the following story is that this hotel has the potential to be one of the best JW Marriott’s in the country – amazing views, willingness to go the extra mile for guests. The end result was perfect, and I am extremely grateful. However, as I learned, when these efforts aren’t communicated properly to the check-in folks who ultimately control the final key strokes, the JW Marriott experience ultimately falls short in Austin."
5,GREAT STAY!,"This was once of the best hotel in which I have ever stayed! The room service was tasty and PROMPT as well as my call to housekeeping. The room was very clean daily, TV was easy to operate, internet accesible and easy to use, so I have no complaints whatsoever."
5,Lived up to all the Hype,"Probably one of the best overall experiences, from check in, room, restaurants and service from any of my hotel stays, regardless of brand.Its obvious the JW Marriott in Austin spend a lot of time and effort on ensuring all their staff are focused on customer service."
5,EXCELLENT STAFF FROM AROUND THE WORLD!,"We have stayed in many JWs over the years and this was the busiest we have ever seen. The staff were from all over the world (students studying hospitality). We were very impressed with everyone we spoke to from the bellboy to the housekeeping and front desk staff. All were very professional and helpful. I was extremely touched that the girl who checked us in noted I had just had a birthday. We had no sooner arrived at the room and were hanging up our clothes when there was a knock at the door and a member of housekeeping had a personally signed birthday card with a lovely bottle of wine, an opener and 2 wine glasses. Such a wonderful start to the trip!! We loved Austin and would highly recommend anyone stay at this hotel. The pool was lovely and we also made use of the gym, which was well-stocked. I always like the cool towels - nice touch."
4,Great place in the heart of downtown.,"This is a gorgeous hotel that is walking distance to some excellent sites. We enjoyed the bats at Congress Bridge one night, nightlife, and an easy walk to the convention center in the day. My husband and I were in town with our baby for a work conference, and this hotel made it a vacation. The rooftop pool was a favorite.We did have one tiny mixup with a guest having my same name, and that caused a delay in checking in. The manager was extremely helpful and quick to make it up to us. Our meal voucher never quite made it, but we were happy for the personal touch."
5,First-rate experience,"Everything the hotel did for our organization's annual meeting was top rate and responsive. The rooms are comfortable and quiet, and the meeting facilities had fine AV and other amenities. The staff was pleasant and helpful."
5,This Is Service!,JW Marriott Austin staff were all extremely friendly and accommodating. They were a major contributor to a great stay. Every time I called the concierge and service desk the person who answered patiently and happily provided answers. This Is Service!
5,Business convention trip that impressed me,"Just finished convention at Orlando Ritz Carlton last week and then JW in Austin. First time visitor. Nice premises. Pleasant staff all around. Housekeeping, Front desk, Restaurants, Bars and convention staff allVery helpful and professional. Thanks"
3,Disappointing,"We have a note on our profile that we allergic to down bedding. We had a late check-in and were ready to get some sleep, but had to wait for housekeeping to redo the bedding. But the biggest issue was valet losing our keys. We brought our car back at night, ate dinner at the hotel, called for our car the next morning to learn they list our key fob. No phone call or message in our room to tell us! No, instead we learned they low jacked our car to move it out of the way overnight. They had to go back and look at security footage to figure out the keys had been dropped in another guest’s car. Don’t even want to think of the nightmare we would have had if that guest had checked out!!! The hotel was sold out & in our opinion they were overwhelmed and ill equipped to handle all the guests. We will not be returning!"
5,Beautiful downtown property with excellent amenities,"The JW Marriott Austin is a stunning property, with vibrant lobby bar and restaurant scene, excellent club lounge, beautiful pool and spa, and comfortable room decor. On this recent trip I was upgraded to a corner suite with an amazing set of windows overlooking the river and nearby cityscape. While working through the night, my room service order exceeded my expectations. In short, I really like this option for a convenient and classy hotel in downtown Austin!"
5,Great Stay in Austin,The hotel was in a great location and quiet for a nice restful week. My spouse was there for a convention while I had ample time to enjoy the facilities. The pool was nice with great service and plenty of room.
5,"Excellent, Especially for the Money","For the money, the best hotel I have experienced. That's not to say it is the absolute best, but it is amazing what this hotel offers for the price. Let's start with the room. There are a few things I need for a deep sleep: quietness, perfect temperature, and pitch black darkness. It seems that most hotels always miss on at least one, but not the JW Marriott Austin. The room was quiet with no discernible noises from neighbors, the outside world, or the AC system. The AC worked perfectly keeping the room at the selected temperature, again without making any noise. The room was completely dark with the curtains closed, and I mean completely dark. It was so dark that it was difficult to get to the bathroom without a light so I'd suggest maybe leaving the curtains open slightly if you need to move at night. Not me though, pitch black is perfect for sleeping.The room cleanliness was beyond reproach and I am usually a cynic, subconsciously looking for cleaning flaws because most hotel cleaning staff always take at least one shortcut. Not here.The hotel service was a step well above most hotels. I was having trouble connecting to the WiFi late at night and the hotel was able to help me promptly. It was an unexpected level of service because honestly, I did not expect that level of service for what I paid for the room.The overall hotel facility is superb and to sum it up I was really surprised at everything available at this hotel for the price I paid. And I actually consider myself pretty hard to completely please. I can usually find some level of satisfaction with most hotels but rarely am I shocked at my satisfaction like I was at this hotel. I would definitely stay here again."
5,"Outstanding, top relaxing hotel","Really outstanding hotel.From arrival to departure top service. Very elegant lobby, bars, restaurants.Room was standard, but with nice lounge chair.Very nice and well apportioned bathroom. Nice cabinet for clothes.Nice housekeeping. Very comfortable bed."
4,housekeeping marginal,"dirty towels were in the room when i checked in. then housekeeping didn't do the room the next day. but there were plenty of staffers to answer questions, give directions and provide extras that i requested."
4,FOR ICES SAKE!,"Central location to visit the great restaurants on S Congress or Rainey Street or food trucks. The building has elegant architecture with star-rating flaws. As an example, many employees have passable English but ain’t from Texas. We had to take the dysfunctional elevator down 13 floors to the ONLY ice machines inconveniently located on the 5th floor. The thermostat works as well as the television remote and the toilet tissue also screams — J.W. QUIT BEING CHEAP!"
5,"Great accomodations. Would recommend to everyone. Friendly, attentive to details.","I found the entire hotel at the JW Marriott standard of staying. The bar service was on top of there game. The banquet service and presentation was as I would expect, great. It was well appointed. Food selections and spaciousness lobby, set the tone for a great stay."
5,Great stay in Austin,"Was there for a business trip. The hotel’s amenities were great, nice gym and pool. The location is excellent, lots of restaurants and shopping near by to keep you busy, If you like, a lot of the area is walkable."
5,"Fab Hotel, Great location!",Great stay in Austin and highly recommend this wonderful hotel. This in-house restaurants were excellent as was the hotel bar. Great location especially for the conference center and fine restaurants like Arlo Grey and even bat watching if yo walk to the bridge/river.
5,WONDERFUL STAY,From the time you check in to when you leave the staff treats makes you feel special. The rooms are spotless and MODERN while the property also offers some amazing restaurants! It is the best location and I cannot wait to go back.
5,Excellent Stay at the JW Marriott Austin!,"Very impressed by the cleanliness, excellence, and service received at this hotel. I've stayed at many Marriott hotels, am a Bonvoy/Rewards member over 25 years and this hotel ranks in the top three. Please rethink the heavy sliding doors on the bathroom! My wife jammed her fingers between the handle and the wall - hurt like crazy and very easy to do!"
4,"My Recent Stay @ the downtown JW Marriott, Austin, Texas","I rate my stay at the downtown Austin, Texas JW Marriott as a 3 out of 5. The hotel was beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly; however, it took hours before I would receive any additional items I requested for my room that were offered to me upon my arrival. I arrived one day before a conference and would have thought that the hotel would be better prepared before the rush of conference guests."
