5,It's was Cold in Austin but its Always Warm at the Dub (W Hotel),"I write a review every few years. I was just there a couple of weeks ago and it was cold in Austin but as always the W folks made it great. I have tried all of the hip, trendy new hotels because I have reached lifetime titanium, however I keep coming back to the W Austin because of many reasons. The folks at the front desk like Javier and Frank's, gracious and knowledgeable, Insider team like Hannah make things wonderful whatever, whenever!! and if you need the code to Red Headed StepChild or reservation at one of the tried and true restaurants no problem. Finally, you really don't need to leave the W for food or drink. Nick's team can serve well and Dustin makes the best drinks in town. Enjoy! Let them know that Ol' Bruce sent ya!!!"
4,Nice hotel,This is a nice hotel in a good location. Like all W‚Äôs it‚Äôs got a hip vibe too. The rooms are comfortable & clean. The lobby & bar areas are good places to meet colleagues or friends. I‚Äôd stay here again without hesitation.
2,Meh,Stayed here b/c I‚Äôm a Marriott platinum member. I usually do the four seasons in Austin but hubby always wanted to try the W. So we tried it. Felt nickeled & dimed. No free water. My mini bar bill was insane. No one responded when I inquired about it.:( The JW is better. Four Seasons best.
1,AVOID if the security of your personal financial information and identity are important!!!,"8-31-09 I made a reservation for the W Austin and as a Titanium member attempted to check in early as it's one of the listed benefits allowed titanium members. Prior to arriving I called the property to inquire about availability. The night auditor on duty clearly indicated they had plenty of availability.Upon arriving at the property she was adamant I would not be able to check in early despite having verified there was availability. She further continued attempting to create a new reservation for the night prior using my points for the night before, plus current night and following night at the highest bar rate available. I chose to simply go to another property. In the time it took drive 5 blocks my account was placed under audit and suspended. Elite services was unable to tell me why this was done. But later indicated someone called in pretending to be me to make a reservation on my account using my points. Additionally, I received email confirmation at 4:40 am CST and a little after 9:00 am CST a reservation was made under my account using my points. Which of course my account was under audit and not something I could have done. The following day I got an email from Marriott Corporate stating the attempted reservation on points for the W Austin would not be honored due to security concerns.As I was no longer able to access my rewards account I had to pay an exorbitantly inflated nightly rate for a room at the next property.A few days later I called elite services and spoke with a manager who was able to take my account out of audit. He suggested I create a pin for my account and while assisting me in setting this up, my account was thrown back into audit. According to the manager someone had called back in pretending to be me while I was still on the current call with him. There were no other notes or reasons given for my account being suspended.I then called the property informing the assistant manager of my suspicions of who the guilty party may have been based off the timing of events and information/documentation received from Marriott. Rather than take my concerns seriously, the assistant manager laughed it off. To assist in an investigation I offered to send him the documentation and recorded phone conversations with his night auditor and Marriott elite services. I was shockingly mistaken to learn the property had no intention of investigating such a serious issue. My offer to provide the evidence collected at that point was refused by the assistant manager. Rather than taking this potential fraud and identity theft seriously he informed me from that moment I was now banned me from the property. Taking how serious of an issue this is I find it highly unusual.My repeated requests for both the W Austin and Marriott Consumer Affairs to investigate this matter have all been refused. This left me with no choice but to file a police report with the local authorities."
1,Scary Hotel for a Women to stay alone,"I‚Äôm having a hard time finding something positive to start this review with. Okay, the staff who works at the pool are amazing! They are the gold stars of this hotel!This hotel needs a remodel. Stains on the carpet everywhere. The water coming from the sink smells like sewer water. The parts of the curtains that should be white are tinged in yellow and brown. It is disgusting.Here‚Äôs the part that is most disturbing to me. I had my Do Not Disturb on my door while I was in my room taking a shower.... luckily the bar was across... as I‚Äôm getting out of the shower I hear this BAM! Someone is coming in my room! WHAT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT DO NOT DISTURB??????? That is such a huge violation!I call down to Whatever-Whenever about someone coming in my room and they could have cared less. It was a joke to them. All that was standing between me and whoever was coming in that door was that bar. This is not a safe hotel. They have no respect for women staying alone."
1,W AUSTIN IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO STAY.,"W AUSTIN IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO STAY. I was a victim of HARRASSMENT between checking-in & the elevator up to my floor August 11th; neither Staff or Security responded. Then the front desk gave my room number & 3 key cards to my room to 3 friends of mine from Houston which I DIDN‚ÄôT INVITE NOR WAS I EXPECTING to BUST INSIDE my room & run up a tab at the pool, etc. This is after I was told by a Female staff member over the phone that my Checkout was August 12 at 12 noon, and then later on the 11th a Male Staff Member told me I was lied to & check-out was THE SAME DAY I CHECKED IN. The W has NOT APOLOGIZED OR DONE ANYTHING except charge me over $1150 for not even 1 day. To boot, it has been 3 DAYS and corporate ‚ÄòMarriott International‚Äô has yet to respond nor compensate me for the atrocities I experienced."
4,Solid Stay,Hotel was nice and served as a good base for us. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Lobby is a bit cold and dark. Feels unfinished. The room was adequate but a bit out of date. Needs more outlets and USB's.
5,Southern hospitality,"We weren‚Äôt staying at this hotel but we were at Trace for drinks before dinner.My husband walked into the lobby with our pup, Venchi and he immediately spawled out in the middle of the lobby because it was only 104 degrees out! The staff was so nice and brought him water. Venchi made a mess with the water but drank every bit of it. We were seated in the covered patio area and our doggo even got a puppy icecream (yogurt, banana, PB)! Venchi wants to thank everyone for taking care of him. Love the hospitality and generosity of the staff!"
5,Great Pool Scene,"The hotel is awesome. I specially enjoyed my time at the pool. The staff was friendly and attentive, especially Eugenio! Nothing was ever too much. He gave us great recommendations on places to visit while on our stay at Austin. Definitely going back before summer ends."
5,Austin Weekend Getaway,"The W Austin is a fabulous hotel. I really enjoyed the pool with friends. The food and drinks are great and one of a kind service. Eugenio provides ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è service, he never let our glasses be empty üòÉ."
5,Highly recommend the W for a weekend away,Our room was ready early and we received an upgrade. Dorian Rodriguez was super helpful and his restaurant/shopping recommendations were great. All of the staff we dealt with were friendly and prepared to go above and beyond. The pool space is very cool and the food at Trace was great. This was our first trip to Austin and we will definitely be back to the W.
5,Awesome staycation!,"I had a birthday 'staycation' at the W Austin and it was one of the best I could've asked for! From pre-arrival, it was apparent that everyone was eager to help make it a special weekend. Frank, Tilley & Brian in the Front Office made sure that I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay from check-in to check-out. Gene at the pool was especially friendly & attentive, and helped me celebrate with some of the other pool servers & bartenders. Nathan at Trace was great as well. Always awesome vibes from the front drive to the team at Away Spa & the style team! Very obvious that the culture is fun loving yet professional from the top, down. Love staying at the W -- will definitely be back soon. Thank you for another great stay!"
5,"Great Service, Superb Staff","Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in Austin. There was a staff member, Eugenio Alvarez, who was particularly helpful, accommodating and shared his knowledge about Austin with us."
5,Very cool experience,"Stayed Friday night at the W in downtown Austin. Must say one of my best hotel stays ever. And, I travel a lot‚Ä¶150 nights a year Diamond with Hilton and Titanium with Marriot. Yes, the W in downtown Austin I‚Äôd put as one of my best experiences.The hotel is very hip. Very relaxing. Service in phenomenal. They pay attention to details, think in advance of what you might want. Everything is easy.Two exceptional folks on the W team in dining area are Katherine H. and Prometheus W. Very informative. Present in every conversation. Strong attention to detail and complete service. The ambiance and entire experience is incredible. Both folks are stars above stars. Exceptional and memorable service."
4,Downtown luxury,"We enjoyed our stay at this luxurious and stylish hotel right in the middle of downtown. We were right in the thick of things, walking distance to everything and anything you wanted to do.The staff was very accommodating, the vibes were just right for relaxing or people watching.They could add a few more drawers but otherwise a good time had by all."
2,Not your typical W,"Pros: Great central location, cool rooftopCons: lobby needs a deep cleaning, rooms are ok but there are repairs needed and couches/showers could use a deep cleaningFor the price it's not worth it and not what I typically experience at W's."
3,Just okay,The hotel is just okay. In my opinion now worth the cost. The first room given to me smelled like urine. The next room was better. There were obvious signs of wear and tear on the furniture and stains in the carpet.I have stayed a better W properties. I wouldn‚Äôt revisit this one.
3,Clean but unfriendly,"I chose to stay at the W based on previous, positive experiences at most other locations (Fort Lauderdale, DC, Boston), but ultimately regret the decision. From the lack of greetings by door staff who opted to chat instead of open the door as guests entered, to the deafeningly loud music at the pool- which I totally get at certain hours on weekends, but at 1pm on a Monday? Opposite of relaxing and recharging. I expected more given the room price. Bed was large but pillows were super unsupportive and left me with a stiff neck and sore back. Housekeeping was on point, and the room was ready earlier than check-in, on a positive note, but suffice it to say, this isn‚Äôt the shining star of the W franchise. I‚Äôd recommend staying elsewhere in the downtown area, particularly if you‚Äôre there as a couple looking to unwind."
1,"Manager Ashely + Alex Humiliate and Defraud me after I return from ER, + demand & copy medical records w/o authorization","I had booked a spa appointment on 6/23, and had to rush to the ER on Thurs, 6/21. I texted the front desk through the Bonvoy App on 6/21, asking to cancel my Sunday appointment, as the cancellation window was 24 hours from 6/23 appointment. The app responded that the reservation was cancelled.However, I got a text late 6/22 that confirmed my spa appointment for 6/23. I went to the front desk to inquire how this was possible. Then, Manager Ashley and Alex claimed that ""the spa has never had a cancellation policy,"" and that I would be responsible for the entire $230 bill unless I ""produced my medical records.""I then brought my medical records down, so they could look and confirm, BUT MANAGER ASHLEY, WITHOUT MY CONSENT AND IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL HIPAA LAW, SCANNED AND MADE COPIES OF MY EMERGENCY ROOM MEDICAL RECORDS.Then, of course, I see the text from my Spa appointment that says ""We require 24 hours notice for cancellations or changes to this booking,"" and show to Alex. Alex then tried to convince me that ""24 hours notice for cancellations doesn't mean I can cancel before 24 hours.""Of course, Ashley and Alex needed to humiliate their disabled guest one last time, so I was curious when both him and Ashley were chuckling when he gave me my room key. Curious, that is, until key didn't work. I then struggled back down to the lobby, where, obviously suppressing laughter, Alex and Ashley were like ""Is there something wrong with your key, sir?""Never book here."
5,Obsessed with this hotel!,"Wow! Where do I even begin!? I have stayed in many hotels for work and this one surpassed expectations. From the valet opening the front door for you to the stunning view from the 16th floor, everything was perfect. The decor and upgrades in the room made it feel like a 5 star resort and Javier + staff was extremely pleasant & professional to interact with. They truly aim to please by going above and beyond to make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with complimentary waters, microwave in room and even provide a shower curtain if needed. I stayed for two nights and wish I had more time to explore the amenities because the pool looked like so much fun but needless to say, I would definitely stay here again if given the chance. This is a must hotel for your Austin visit!"
5,Great staff and cool hotel,"I have frequently stayed in many of the other Starwood brand hotels but rarely W, it seemed a bit too gimmicky. I decided to give this one a try. The rooms I stayed in were beautiful. I say rooms because there was an issue with my first room and the staff was unable to solve the problem (I let them know after my first night). The following day, after realizing there was still the same problem, a manager came up to inspect the room with me. He apologized that it was not fixed and moved me into a much larger suite. Brian even followed up after my stay via email and gave me addition Bonvoy points due to the inconvenience. The Starwood hotels (now owned by Marriott) offer great service (unlike other chains such as Hilton).Problems happen in all buildings - it's how the staff responds that makes the difference. The W staff is on point."
4,Great service & comfortable beds,"The W hotel is a very nice hotel; not easy to find since the sign is about 7 in high but once you find it- you are going to like it.The customer service is exceptionally professional & accommodating.The rooms are good size, beds very comfortable, the decor is very contemporary & hip.The lobby is not your typical lobby- it‚Äôs very hip and dark... I guess dark is hip now!Good downtown location."
5,Wonderful!,I love this hotel. We have stayed here several times.Valet Brandon and Front Desk Dorian make a fantastic first impression. There‚Äôs nothing like a warm welcome!Great food in bar and room service. Comfy bed. Clean room. Friendly staff throughout the hotel.Wonderful stay!
5,About the best vibe of any hotel in Austin,"Stay in enough hotels and you get a sense for spaces, vibe, ambiance. The place is incredibly well designed, super chill common spaces that spread out in a labyrinth of intimate rooms to enjoy time with friends. The room was AWESOME, got a nice upgrade to a suite for my birthday (and Bonvoy status I suppose). Probably 900sf and well appointed. Front desk staff were consummate pros. If I have to nit pick, $50 for valet is a bit lofty, but I am guessing they have to pay to park in the garage across the street. Otherwise a perfect property."
5,Wedding pictures,"A big shout out to the day manager Ernie!! We can‚Äôt thank you enough for saving our special day!! The hotel staff is beyond the call of duty. First class all around. We can‚Äôt wait to return soon, and enjoy the gorgeous pool."
5,"Excellent, under-rated hotel","We stayed for two nights over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel is modern and in a great location (downtown, close to the lake, with a good-sized Starbucks just around the corner). The room was surprisingly spacious for a downtown location. Service was excellent all around. We did not notice any of the typical W quirks - it felt like a well-functioning, stylish hotel. The only unusual thing was that there was no door leading to the shower area (and the shower door itself was all glass), but there was a little card in the bathroom offering to provide a privacy curtain upon request. We requested it and it served the purpose perfectly, as it allowed one person to take a shower while the other used the washbasin. The restroom has a door, so no issues there.The hotel offers valet parking only, but their rates are very competitive - we checked out the parking garage across the street and the hotel rates were actually lower! They also have an efficient system for retrieving your car where you text them your ticket number and they bring the car out. The people at the bell-desk offered top-notch service - always holding the door open when you entered, and not hanging around for a tip after loading the car. Highly recommend this hotel!!"
5,Fantastic views and service!,"We stayed overlooking the river on the 12th floor, which was an amazing view. When we arrived I will say the vibrant (packed) pool scene could be heard in our room (music and bar scene noise), so if you want it quiet don‚Äôt overlook the pool. Our room was clean and beautifully decorated. The only thing I missed was a dresser or drawers to unpack. It was just a weekend, so we lived out of the suitcase and hung a few items. Bar in lobby and brunch in the record room were fantastic. Service at desk was great too! Loved having Starbucks next door. Tons of Austin to see nearby... great walking."
2,Loud construction site just north of hotel,"Beware: Horrible loud screeching noise from 3:30 am to 5 am Sunday night / Mon morning from construction site across street plus again 5 am -7 am tues night with heavy equipment humming loudly. From googling, doesn‚Äôt look like they are allowed to do that at those hours even in a business zone per Austin city code. Management needs to complain to city on behalf of its high paying guests or else will never be enforced. two stars for the nice pool though."
4,"Great location, very helpful staff, cool, modern decor","Stayed at W Austin for business in May 2019. Location is perfect. Many restaurants and entertainment venues are nearby. Hotel is modern and cool. Restaurant is nice. Staff is very helpful. Room is nice also. But a few things were missing to be five star. Great coffee maker in the room, but no stirrer or spoon for sweeteners/cream. Not enough plug ins at the work desk. No true drawers to keep small items such as socks and under wears, just open shelves. Although a few things are missing to be the top notch hotel, because of the location and service, probably I'd stay again when I am in Austin."
3,Very Mediocre W,This property is tired and lifeless and expensive. Service was unenthusiastic and lame. I have several future trips planned to Austin and have no plans to return here. Water pressure was poor and it took several MINUTES to get hot water.
5,Five Stars,"One of the best hotel experiences I've had in Austin. Gilbert and Shelby could not have been better hosts, they really made our experience unforgettable and were very accommodating. Five stars... At the W hotel, Winter is never coming."
1,Should have stayed at the Four Seasons,"Full disclosure: I would happily give this hotel chain 3 stars but ALL swanky hotels have now begun including their bar reviews with the hotel reviews. That is rather deceiving.What has happened to my precious W?11 years ago I stayed in my first W in New Orleans. As a private hotel chain, Starwood and its hotels were AWESOME. The W was all about service. Everything inside was free. Free WiFi, free snacks in the room, free parking, you couldn't tip the bellmen or concierge, even a free drink upon checking with a cheese plate. You could easily book, cancel, and change your stay without fees until the last second. The bar was awesome and the rooms ultra-quiet. The place was fully booked all the time.Fast forward to today in 2019. Marriot bought Starwood in 2016 and almost immediately started milking its loyal customer base for money.The W is now an exercise in taking as much money as possible from you. They really do not care about service or the customer anymore.I have no problem with paying well for a premium room in a premium location. But then, I was constantly fleeced for every nuance from WiFi, to parking, to the water in the room, to extra towels, to a rollaway, to an extra person stay over. It is tiresome.Worse, gone is the time when you could easily change your booking or cancel a room last minute (or even just a night). They want your money and make no mistake, they do not give a damn about you.Lets talk about THIS Austin W. The rooms are tiny, there is no bathroom door (hope you‚Äôre close), there is no water pressure, the hot water never got above luke warm, the room smelled like dogs, the walls would vibrate when a door was closed in an adjacent room, the staff are very pretentious and fail to respond to even simple requests, the hotel does maintenance during all hours on the elevators so it is very difficult to sleep. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.So, sadly, I must say to AVOID the Austin W if you plan to stay. The bar is still awesome, just don't expect the rest of the hotel to be anything other than a dressed up Marriot with demeaning staff.For true service, there are few places left where you are safe anywhere in the world. I can strongly recommend the Four Seasons, the Ritz Carlton, any Trump International, any Sofitel, and any Mandarin Oriental. A Waldorf Astoria is a second good pick. The W is no better than a courtyard Marriot except for the bar...Goodbye W...My wife warned me...Self note: you should always listen to your wife."
2,The end of the W for us.,"This was the worst hotel stay we've had in years. It's one thing to pay $600 a night for a luxury room, but quite another to pay for a small, poorly designed room that constantly booms bass all day and night long. We splurged for the rooms with the outdoor balcony, over the pool, but the sun made it so hot out there that no one ever sat on their balconies (the hotel was completely booked) and they could have easily shaded them. We were surprised that everyone sitting at the pool was in their early twenties (how do they afford this place?), but we didn't want to hang there because they were being obnoxious in the pool for the entirety of our 5 day stay. Also, the pool was freezng and it was 90 degrees outside. To our dismay, they informed us that the pool was not equipped with a heater....we chose this hotel because we swim for our exercise and it looked like a beautiful lap pool. Who ever heard of an upscale hotel not heating their lap pool. It wasn't just us...everyone at the pool was only dipping their feet in and we heard a lot of other people complain about it. The decorating was tired, dark, and depressing. I felt like the designer was going for ""convention hotel meets Chinese opium den."" On our last night, the desk clerk wouldn't reissue a key to me, despite the fact that they said hello to me several nights before. I had to wake up my mother and send her downstairs to sign for me. Ridiculous. I'll give them two stars for cleanliness and the valets were nice enough."
3,Not impressed,Hotel seemed wonderful online... not impressed with it in person. Concierge booked me a blow out for my birthday day evening before a nice meal. Went to salon and they said they had called back and cancelled it because the stylist was sick. I never received this message from the hotel and didn‚Äôt receive a call.Took the luggage guy 45 minutes to come get our luggage so we could leave and valet 30 minutes to retrieve the car... and that‚Äôs even when we told them the night before what time we needed the car by AND called that morning to remind them.Spa area was gorgeous and the gym had a wonderful view out onto the city... also every piece of equipment you could want!
3,A YOUNG CITY!,"Excellent location in downtown Austin with walkability to shopping, restaurants, and some music. A short Uber ride gets you everywhere. The hotel has a nice bar, friendly staff, and decent food. We booked it for the pool and were disappointed that at $700 a night, it was not heated. Not pleasant unless you like an arctic swim. The rooms are very poorly laid out with no drawers, little closet space and no place to put your toiletries unless you are not sharing the room. No tub. A big stretch of entry that could have been used more efficiently. For a weekend, fine. For more than that, stay two nights at any other hotel and have more interior comfort."
5,2nd night was great,"As they say, it‚Äôs not about a problem during a stay, but how the problem was handled.My first night was horrible - something loud clanging that kept me up at all hours. An elevator perhaps, I‚Äôm unsure.When I asked for help, Brian the manager was quick to offer a solution. I was very appreciative of the communication and the response.PROs- excellent downtown location walkable to many restaurants- clean, comfortable rooms- typical ‚Äúgroovy‚Äù W ambiance- good food on site- friendly staffCONs- nothing since my concern was addressed"
4,Great Location. Great Management,"Great location. There is a Starbucks on the same block.Rooms are maintained well.Elite status recognized and benefits delivered.Great staffIn-room dining has negligible vegetarian options. The vegetarian burger was very ordinary. In-room dining needs to be improved for the price charged.Overall, I will come back and stay."
5,16th Annual Guys Trip,"Hotel accommodates 25 of us. Exquisite hotel with great design and architecture. The bar and lounge area was spacious, comfortable, and a joy to hang out at. Bar staff was extremely accommodating and knowledgeable. Front desk was warm and friendly. Special shout out to Tilly and Ashley. Tilly took great care of my friends jacket, which he left in the room. And Ashley went out of her way to get me some packing tape so that I could secure a piece of art. The gentlemen at the entrance held the door for me every time and were friendly and ready to give recommendations. Room was room was cleaned very well every day by the staff. Special shout out to Mary Lu for being so friendly and always with a smile. Best hotel gym I‚Äôve ever worked out in, with great views and three awesome Peloton bikes. The men‚Äôs locker room had all the amenities I needed and my personal favorite was the large shower with steam room feature. The pool area was thoughtfully laid out, though a bit small if you actually want to swim and play. Overall great experience. My 4 days there alone made me want to sight up for Marriott rewards club."
5,Anniversary fun!,Great staff and beautiful view of the lake. We upgraded to the spectacular room which was nicely appointed. They made our dog feel so welcome with a surprise gift! Fun at the bar and great people watching. But no place to really dance to the great music the DJ was spinning.
4,Nice but not Wow,"We've stayed at many hotels all over the country as you can see from our reviews. Booked the W for a friend's party at ACL small stage and while it is a convenient location, it is wayyyyyy overpriced. We bit the bullet because it was a combined Valentine's/Anniversary/Party stay. One bonus; they upgraded to a bit larger room upon hearing it was for our Anniversary.The lobby is modern and inviting; a bit smaller than I would have expected but they can't do much with the layout with the walls the way they are. Very nice staff, clean common areas. Rooms are nice and modern but not the wow factor that I was expecting. The housekeeping also left a little to be desired; handprints(?) on the headboard, shower needed detail attention, etc.We had a great view so that was another bonus. Cool gas fireplace near first bar adjoining into 2nd lobby area. We walked into Trace for brunch Sunday but it was dark and too quiet and didn't seem as inviting. We walked across the street to Taverna (see separate review).We stopped into the bar Saturday night after our friend's party and the night life was hoppin'! Had no idea but it was a lot of fun. Others who've stayed here say it gets loud on Fri/Sat if your room is near the lower floors so if you don't want to hear music until 2 be sure and ask for a higher room!All in all a nice stay, just don't think the price and what you get for it justify the high price :)"
1,DO NOT GO TO THE BAR,"Unconsciously high prices, bad service, poor (small) pours. This was a massive disappointment! I would not recommend.Good mixed drinks, straight pours were small and over-priced. DO NOT come here at all!!!"
5,Best Location in the City,"I love staying at the W because there are a lot of great restaurants and things to do within walking distance.The seating areas, bars, and restaurants are off to the side and are a bit of a labyrinth. I always get lost in them.The room is decent and the bathroom is spacious. Wifi is strong and it has always been quiet when I have stayed there.The breakfast was very good and a bar is a great place for a drink with friends. Word of warning- it tends to get overrun by younger locals at happy hour. Not necessarily a bad thing, depending on your point of view.I will be back"
3,"Clean, nice staff, small rooms, no place to sit","I've stayed at a few W hotels and they are definitely different than the average hotel. Different is not better in this case--the rooms are tiny for the $, and you only get one sorry desk chair if you happen to want to sit somewhere in your room. Sure, the bed is there, but not really the best for reading, watching tv, or just taking some time to chill.The location is good, rooms very clean and friendly staff. Just don't touch anything in the room unless it says free or it may show up on your bill. Hotels put those annoying treats in a room to cash in on an accidental purchase or gouge you for the convenience. I'm terrified to pick up anything in hotels like this as it is likely to show up on a bill for just moving an item.SXSW visitors--you guys get hosed on the very high price for this hotel. There are much better out there for less $ in the same general area. I got mine via an online bidding site and don't feel as ripped off. Sure it is ""trendy"" but you really don't get anything worth the trendy price tag."
5,Wow ...upgraded to a corner suite,"This has been a fantastic break away ...we have experienced W Hotels before , and we are not disappointed , from the moment of check in, lovely Dorian checked us in and said that the room was ready early , and we were upgraded to a fabulous corner suite :))!! Then we received a welcome gift consisting of ‚ÄúW Austin hospitality ‚Äú a bottle of Prosecco , Austin beer and stubbie holders , an Austin bandanna and a bottle of sparkling water !! I am beyond amazed at the level of service and welcome that we have received. I absolutely love The W Hotel , and they have not disappointed...I will definitely be staying at another W Hotel wherever we go .The best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in for service and unique ‚Äúboutique ‚Äú feel , they can‚Äôt do enough for you to make your stay special."
4,"Still top notch, but needs to catch up with the newer properties in town..","I have reviewed this property in the past and at the time those reviews were accurate at the time but its 2019 and like this hotel..its time to update a few things!First it wold be great for Starwood/Envoy executive members if there was a dedicated checkin desk LIKE EVERY OTHER PROPERTY. This seem minor to most people but at the price point and with the emphasis on loyalty program- it should be consistent with the other hotels.Staff is always super friendly and genuinely helpful. I checked in with my son this visit and when we got back to our room we had a plate of choc chip cookies and milk waiting for him! This is the kind of service the W has always touted and the personal touch is why I keep going back.Great pool. Always good action. Hotel food at Trace is outstanding and the atmosphere is always energetic. The gym used to be the best hotel fitness center but everyone else has updated and now its just a nice space that hasn't really been updated in a long time.The other properties now have an executive lounge for snacks and drinks and happy hours- hard to figure out why the W hasn't caught up to this yet. For about $50 less a night the JW Marriott offers this plus a bigger pool and more food options only a few blocks away.Another issue that most of you won't care about but its huge for me, the Tesla charger here is 6 miles an hour..so staying overnight I get less than 100 miles of charge? The JW Marriott will charge triple the speed so I keep having to drive my car over there and tip big so I can get back to Dallas. Would love it if the W got with the times here..In conclusion, I still love this property and its ""hip"" factor will always keep it booked and higher priced but it needs to catch up with the rest of the properties in town. The Westin has a rooftop pool and is usually almost $100 less with the the JW Marriott around $50 less and offers a lot more updated perks. I do appreciate the personal touch of the W staff and Ernie the manager took great care of us (even when he couldn't offer me the suite I requested as a Platinum member he still stood out positively )I will be back here but only when the room price drops during slow times, otherwise I am going to spend most nights at the JW Marriot."
4,Nice hotel with great gym,"Room was very nice and good service. Lots of comfortable common areas to hang out and meet or have a drink. Very nice, large gym with pilates and yoga studio. Spa looked nice too but did not get to use it. Similar to other Ws I have stayed at. Would stay here again if I have the chance."
4,"Excellent location and hotel, front desk needs some training though!","I absolutely loved this hotel! It is very artistic and chic. The lobby is beautifully decorated as well as the rooms. I got a complimentary upgrade too that I enjoyed very much! On the other hand, experience with the front desk wasn't great. They greeted and assisted me very professionally and had a smile always. But at the moment of check in the agent wrote down the wrong room number on my key card and that resulted in going up and down twice. I had been trying to open another room! By the third time, I just called with the phone by the elevators and they told me my room was actually written down incorrectly and that they apologized for the mistake. After like 15 minutes I could get into my room. Then, at the moment of check out I asked to pay room and tax with one card and incidentals with another card and when I gave out the second card they charged everything on that one. Room service staff got my breakfast exactly how I ordered it and it was delicious! Housekeeping was outstanding as my room was very clean and beautiful."
4,Hotel is nice hot spot trendy,The front desk was nice but the service was slow and had reservation wrong and didn't apologize but the hotel was nice and trendy great location and people watchingWould be back for drinks and food and pool
4,W Austin,"Very nice hotel. Modern with a club downstairs. Parking is bad. ($45 valet service) Room is kinda small but nice. Great view. The tub/shower is BAD. The tub is about 3-4 feet high, so it is hard to get in and out of, especially inebriated. Haha. Great location though."
3,"Location excellent, typical W hotel","Stayed here for business 4 nights. Very typical W -- trying hard to be hip and cool but chocked full of less-than-hip business travelers. Ate in the restaurant and the food was fine but expensive. Hotel is dark with standard W dark gray halls and somewhat weird rooms -- like that giant weird lounge chair they put in the W hotel room that no one ever sits on. Biggest issue I had was that the staff just weren't very helpful --like they were too cool for the guests. They also seemed to be screwing up all the details due to the recent Marriott-Westin integration -- charged for internet when it is part of my business rate, wrong Marriott # in the system so no recognition of my lifetime Platinum status,"
5,Great stay,We just got back from a 4 night stay at the W hotel in Austin and although everyone was lovely and the experience from an upgrade at check in to a great gym was terrific... I wanted to mention 2 exceptional people. Julia the concierge planned a tour of the UT campus including a map with specific stops for us ... as we were coming to see the school while it was closed for winter break. The other standout was Prometheus in Trace restaurant who took great care of us and even remembered how we liked our coffee‚Äî and brought it to us before we had time to ask.We will definitely be back at this hotel if we find ourselves back in AustinThanks for a great stay
4,"Modern, stylish hotel in the middle of Austin","The W in Austin is in a great location, has amazing customer service, every amenity you might need and our room was lovely.My only complaint is how busy the pool was. This is probably part of the appeal for a lot of people (pool parties, live music, lots of drinking), but for me (who wanted to relax) the pool area was overcrowded and a no-go from Thursday - Sunday when it became a party zone. I would have stayed somewhere quieter had I known. Obviously no fault of the hotel, just personal preference!"
5,"Beautiful space, great location, amazing service.","I just received amazing service and had to shout out about it. In additional to having wonderful facilities for events, their service is fantastic. The banquets waiter JC in particular went above and beyond to make my visit spectacular. Thank you. I look forward to returning!"
5,IMPECCABLE,"Absolutely every detail of our stay was taken care of with the utmost care. We were checked in by Ernie, who was welcoming, professional, and made us feel like royalty!The suite was exceptional and well appointed.We will certainly return and we will recommend The W to anyone looking for an incredible experience."
5,Amazing stay!,"Hello! Just wanted to express what exceptional customer service I experienced at the W, Austin. Brian Leibel, Dorian, Ronald and Hannah Coulter are incredible and provided me with world class customer service! Very grateful for all their genuine care."
4,Enjoyable Stay!,Really enjoyed my short stay here! I had a late check-in and was quickly given a room as well as instructions to a nearby restaurant. They offered to take my luggage to my room while i went out to grab dinner - nice touch! Location is central to restaurants galore! Room and bathroom was very spacious and well designed. I‚Äôd stay again!
5,Terrific Exeperience from the moment I Arrived,"I was greeted by friendly gentlemen opening the door, and it only got BETTER from there. At check-in, Caleb was superb. His personality shined brightly when I asked him about a few local events. He even remembered my name when I waved the following day.My room was immaculate, with a stunning view to the South. Everything in the room was clean and worked properly. The Nespresso machine in the room was a nice touch, but I prefer other brands.The hotel is just a few short blocks from 6th Street, where many of the local pubs (and parties) can be found. Next door is where they film Austin City Limits. And numerous other local attractions are nearby as well."
4,"Lovely modern hotel, great location and friendly staff","Great hotel, great location staff very friendly at check in and room very nice and swanky, not much privacy in shower area but could get a curtain if needed. Positives excellent gym and equipment, Austin had a water issue but they provided plenty of bottled water for teeth etc, Nespresso coffee machine and plenty of room as you came in behind the door to stand cases, downside was lack of usable storage such as drawers, bathroom shelves for cosmetics and like many hotels don‚Äôt put plugs near mirrors for doing hair, makeup etc. Overall very nice and good breakfast available did valet parking and again staff were very helpful."
3,"As usual, style over substance (and don't share a room with your kids!)","The W Austin is typical of what I've found at W hotels elsewhere. The good: friendly service, stylish accommodations, nice toiletries, walkable/convenient location. The bad: furnishing and fixture choices that look cool but aren't practical. Some examples: There wasn't a single drawer in the room where I could unpack my stack of folded tops or toss underwear/socks - instead there are 2 tiny cubbies in the closet that are the right size for doll clothes, along with a couple of cloth covered baskets that don't really fit ""away"" anywhere. The sink in the bathroom is so shallow that if you want to wash or even just rinse out even a pair of socks, it will be difficult to do without creating a wet mess in the bathroom. And while there's a door on the toilet cubicle, there isn't one on the bathroom... so anyone in the room has full visibility of whoever's taking a shower in the glass-enclosed shower stall (not always a problem, but sometimes it is!). And while some people may really appreciate the Nespresso machine, I'm a tea drinker, and there was no way to make a cup of tea in the room (unlike most hotels with coffee service in the room which can make tea as well)."
4,Contemporary hotel and trendy lobby bar,"Rooms are modern and comfortable. Service is great. The lobby/bar is a late night hotspot on Friday and Saturday nights, so it's a great place to start or end your evening, especially if you're a guest at the hotel. You'll want to catch an Uber/Lyft or taxi if you're going out as you probably won't be within walking distance of your restaurant."
4,Party Spot,"Pros:-not far from the airport.-next to the river and lots of entertainment venues/restaurants/bars-clean modern rooms-helpful staffCons:-parking is expensive-on the weekends, there's a pool party and it's filled mostly with locals. For us staying there, it's difficult to find a chair. Definitely not a family atmosphere. 18+. It's over by 7 or 8pm."
5,The high-end of hip,"It's a bit pricey, but the rooms are really nice with comfortable beds, a modern bathroom, large shower. Plenty of good, not-so-healthy, snacks to purchase when you get back at night; my room had a nice view of the city and it's conveniently located next to ACL and the Willie Nelson statue. The staff is super nice and helpful, the restaurant has really good food and prices for lunch weren't outrageous. Thumbs up!"
3,It could be better.,"So, we love the design of the room, but every time we have stayed there, the management is different and still a messy experience. Maybe it is the way the stations are set up so informally and out in the open. Perhaps because there's so much party-aftermath... Like people leaving beer cans, drinks and puke in the halls... Oh Downtown Austin, you are so droll...There's never a time for the staff to take a breath and handle things with professionalism. I am expecting them to break out their cell phones and start instagramming their experiences with customers while I wait. I guess, for me, if I want to shell out money on a hotel, I want it to feel seamless and easy, not clunky and loud. PS, my reviews are for the four or five times I stayed in 2016, not 2017. They don't offer those dates."
5,Exceptional service and super friendly staff,"Lovely hotel with wonderful staff members who make you feel very welcome. Super comfortable bed, extremely clean accommodations, quiet with plenty of room. A special thank you to Daniel who went out of his way to take care of a special request. We will only stay at the W when we return to Austin!"
5,"As Owen Wilson would say ""WOOOOOOOOW""","W Austin is magic! Let me preface by saying this review is long overdue. I visited here the weekend of August 23, 2018. The fact that I‚Äôm writing this review a month later tells you how kickass my stay was. And here we go- there was not a single touchpoint that went unnoticed with this staff. From the time my friends and I arrived on our girl‚Äôs weekend every person we met at W Austin was a rockstar! Some special shoutouts:- Nadeen- OMG let me tell you about this unicorn! Nadeen is the definition of an amazing employee. She anticipates your needs, goes above & beyond all while delivering it with a smile. Good eye contact and a friendly demeanor is all I need to make me happy. If you are thinking of visiting W Austin you need to meet Nadeen (I am sure I spelled her name wrong too..so sorry!)- Nathan- bartender at TRACE. His cocktails were almost as stellar as his knowledge and shining personality. I could have talked to Nathan all night but my words were starting to slur. His cocktails are potent yet balanced.I‚Äôd like to throw some extra love to Joann (GM), Kayla (Catering Manager), Elsy (server at TRACE) and Caleb & Janelle (Welcome Desk agents that Monday morning). Without all of you I am sure our stay would have been lovely but you made it an incredible experience! Keep rocking it, W Austin gang"
4,Lovely hotel,"After a horrible experience at my last SPG property ( Le Meridian Goa), I came to this hotel with limited expectations. From my warm welcome, to my beautiful room this hotel exudes chic and quality. My check in was lovely and the lunch recommendation was spot on . I loved visiting the graffiti park and strolling the surrounding neighborhood. I had dinner at the hotel restaurant which was pricey and I felt like I was being rushed despite it being empty, however the staff was attentive and the food was good. I loved the ‚Äúliving room‚Äù it was perfect to sit and relax by the fire. I will be back!"
5,The little extra,"Great experience! Ordered room service and Tamika Nowlin (staffer) delivered it promptly. When I told her it was my birthday, she returned 20-mins later with a bday cake for my wife and I to enjoy. It was a warm and heartfelt surprise. The little extras go a long way. Great hotel / Great location!"
5,Love the rooms and location,Stayed here for my second time during SXSW. I love the pool and the hotel bar is also very fun. Great place for young people to stay and the location is walking distance to so much. Safe area and the rooms were nice but a little small.
5,In Town for a Tradeshow!,"We had the most pleasant and seamless experience at the W! Molly, our event manager, handled the room block for all 30 of our staff to stay at the hotel. She handled all communication and last minute changes (even down to the day of check in) like a pro! I have booked a large block of rooms at a number of hotels all over the country and there is inevitably always a lot of errors and most time I am fighting to get things changed or fixed and it is a nightmare. I had the opposite experience here...it couldn't have gone more smooth and I'm so very thankful for that! We will definitely be back again, fantastic service! Thanks so much!"
3,Overtated,"We reserved this hotel to see a concert next door at the Moody Theater. Great location and service was good. The hotel is advertised as an upscale hotel, but is more of a high end dormitory. Lobby is small, oddly designed and not check in friendly. We were upgraded to a bigger room since they overbooked and it was just over 300 square feet. Nice view of the lake, but very small and the room needed work, I.e. torn wallpaper, broken screen, etc. the pool is a narrow pool and lots of people in it looking like a frat party. They told us they let non guests in for a fee which is puzzling. Had a drink downstairs and not an engaging area which needed a good cleaning. When we were leaving, called down to get our car from valet. Waited 10 minutes outside and checked on status. The front desk did not call and had to wait another 15 minutes. Thought it would be a great hotel, but left disappointed. Ran into another couple in the elevator and they mentioned the same feelings without us asking."
4,Labor Day weekend get-away!,One of my fav hotels in Austin for the perfect pool party and bar scene. This place definitely needs some renovation work though as it‚Äôs a bit outdated. JW Marriott is better for the rooms but I prefer the W for the pool party and lobby bar.
5,Frank was awesome!,"I was visiting friends in Austin for a concert, and we read online that the W pool was available for day use for a fee. We showed up on Saturday and learned that Saturdays were the only day the pool was for hotel guests only.We were pretty bummed, but Frank the manager (I guess he was a manager) came to our rescue and provided us access since we'd come all the way downtown and I was visiting from out of town. He later checked on us at the pool. It was a wonderful gesture and it really made our day!I am actually Marriott/Starwood Gold (which he didn't know), so I wanted to pass along the compliment. It doesn't go unnoticed when customer service is excellent regardless of whether the customer has status."
5,Great experience in Austin,"Stayed here for a girls‚Äô weekend in Austin. The hotel is upscale and trendy, the bar somewhat raucous at night - typical W. The customer service was impeccable. I‚Äôm an SPG member and the hotel staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. They included a reduced charge for room service and a gracious, handwritten note, as well as giving us a late check out on Sunday.Great location downtown. We walked to 6th Street for drinks one night and walked to dinner the other night. The shower is exposed in the bathroom layout - it might make some people uncomfortable, but you just need to request a privacy curtain from housekeeping. Highly recommend!"
2,Dog Days of Summer.,"We chose this hotel due to reputation, location and for a nice pool for a short family visit to Austin. We were immediately underwhelmed by the expensive on site parking, ie $45/night and general lack of nearby parking except to park on the street or in parking lots nearby for short increments requiring us to move the car to seek overnight locations. The pool was essentially a Las Vegas style bar scene by noon, as we were told if we wanted to swim to do so in the early morning. And given its narrow dimensions, is only usable for standing and drinking. We returned from our outing one day to hear another customer on our floor seeking out their dog! When we got to our door, a scratching noise was heard and when we opened the door, the dog ran out. The cleaning lady who had recently emerged from the room next to ours admitted she let the dog into our room, with no explanation. I was frankly a bit surprised they let dogs into this hotel, but was glad we had returned shortly after the dog was permitted in our room as no telling what we would have found had we stayed out all evening."
4,Nice W Property in Great Location,"We checked into this hotel at the last minute after a very unpleasant experience at the place we originally booked. It was about 11pm, and such a relief to walk into the stylish lobby and be greeted by warm, professional service and a bottled of chilled water at check-in.I've stayed in W properties before and this one delivers on service, a great bar, and nice room. The room decor is a bit dated but as expected very comfortable with high quality bed/linens, fluffy towels and bathrobes, and Bliss products.The location is great - we left our rental car with valet for the entire stay, and just walked or took short Uber rides everywhere. The lobby bar was a perfect place for a nightcap, and service was excellent throughout our stay."
5,Great property,"This hotel is not the newest in downtown Austin, but is still hip and a fun place to stay.Seasoned desk-agent, Caleb is great at recognizing regular guests and welcoming them back. Pool, bar and fitness center are great.Also 02 room series are my favorite!"
4,Great hotel in the heart of downtown,"Very upscale, contemporary hotel in the heart of downtown. Walking distance to everything. Front desk and staff were very accommodating, friendly and helpful. The Bell Staff was somewhat lacking and not very helpful when getting luggage out of and to the Uber's"
5,Amazing front desk service by Alex,"A very last minute trip was great! all due to our front desk guy, Alex. He was very accommodating. We got our balcony, with pool view and even a little birthday celebration cake. Everything was walking distance from the hotel and they had a great pool. The only con was the concierge could not recommend any restaurants. But our Alex came to the recuse and saved dinner! Alex needs an amazing promotion!! Best customer ever! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
4,Good hotel close to many,"Stayed there one night in business.Usual cool W, nice room, got upgrade being SPG gold member. Thanks W.Was very close to my visit site, good neighborhood didn‚Äôt try pool or anything else but looking forward to my next trip."
4,Nice place,"The hotel is nice- it was always clean, and the staff was always very helpful. Just a little bit on the pricey side :( But overall, a pleasant stay and grateful for the help from the front desk to the room service."
4,Customer Service Made Our Stay,"I love W properties; always a comfortable stay and the W Austin didn't disappoint. However, the hotel, like several others in Austin, opens its doors to the 20something crowd during the summer. While I knew this upon booking - I wrongly assumed it was 1x/week; nope it's 3x! While we weren't in Austin to hang by the pool, my husband and I did want to take a dip in the late afternoon and were horribly disappointed to feel alienated. Not cool when you are a registered guest. We spoke to the coincerge, Hannah to see if we could use the Residence pool- and while that wasn't possible she called around to a couple of different properties to see if we could use their pool for a couple of hours. The 4seasons welcomed us, which was great (and quiet!) Anyway, Hannah really went over and beyond for us! She even got a W driver (Jacob- very nice!) to drive us to the 4Seasons.I am a Starwood member so I get upgraded :) and I would return but would think twice if we go to Austin again in the summer.Oh- and Alex at the front desk- super nice and helpful"
4,Business hotel with nice lounge,"Nice decor, clean room, good amenities. Breakfast is good at the restaurant in the lobby. The lounge would benefit from having more outlets for device charging. The lounge bar is a nice gathering point for groups."
4,"As expected, shout out to Alex in the front desk","I like the atmosphere of the w hotel in general this one is no exception. The room was just fine.What I like the most was the personnel , they were all very attentive especially Alex. I was in need of a battery for my toothbrush, when I called reception to see if by any chance they had one available and he replied yes without saying that it was his own. An employee delivered it to my door and he mentioned Alex generous gesture. Wow that was very nice of him.Thank you so much!"
4,Business hotel with nice lounge and pool,"Booked a last minute weekend stay and reserved two rooms using the app. It was easy to use and by the time I arrived to the hotel, the rooms were ready.The hotel is a typical W hotel with dark walls and contrast, and the floor plan for each floor was interesting in that the doors for each room was tucked away.The lounge was nice with interesting customers and the hostess was excellent. She was very attentive and customer focused.The pool area is very busy on Sundays with a DJ and full bar. Nice place to unwind and just relax."
4,Erik Saves the Day!,"The W Austin is in a perfect location for exploring the city. It is centrally located to all of the ‚Äúsight seeing‚Äù and entertainment. The hotel is formatted similarly to most W hotels. It certainly sticks to its LEED certified ‚Äúgreen‚Äù building status as well. Upon checking in for a business trip, my coworker and I were placed in a room with one bed. Also, I tried to sign in with my SPG, but the guy at the front desk gave up when he couldn‚Äôt find my membership. Without SPG, I would‚Äôve had to pay for WiFi. The front desk kindly sent up Erik, an ambassador. He not only moved us to an appropriate room, but helped me get signed in with SPG. Furthermore, he made us smile every time we came through the lobby. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at the W, and the awesome service provided by Erik."
5,Beware the pool party!,Wonderful hotel but they host a pool party with DJ on Thursday evenings in the summer. The noise on the south side of the building is unbearable. The pool is packed with young partiers who are not staying at the hotel.
5,"If you have a chance to stay at this property, the W in beautiful Austin, do it!","From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome. From the glass of Champagne to way we were greeted. The W is just a hip cool place to stay.When we arrived in the room there were these delicious strawberries and a personal handwritten note welcoming us to the Austin W. A really nice touch.We loved our stay.Sometimes on a business trip, there are often times when things happen and you need something, in my case, it was a piece of technology, that I could not do my work without. This was in no way any fault of the hotel, however, the lengths that the staff went to assist will not soon be forgottenI must say that the staff all had our backs, the front desk staff, the service staff and of course the servers at the pool every employee was so friendly. Our room was spotless. It was so clean, we loved the BLISS products, a very nice touch. Top tier service from everyone.I love the vibe of the place, everyone is so much fun you can feel the energy when you walk through the door.We had a beautiful suite, I loved how it was designed, the colors and I loved the view the large soaking tub and the rainfall shower was a great way to end the day.I think we used every amenity available, the bar, the pool, which is referred to as the ‚ÄúWet Deck‚Äù and of course the spa. One word about the ‚ÄúWet Deck‚Äù if you like to people watch, this is the place. Everyone was having so much fun.After the intensity of the business tasks that I was there for, spending time unwinding in the beautiful spa was the perfect way to decompress. That steam shower was so relaxing, I did not want to get out.I can‚Äôt wait to come back.I want to personally acknowledge a few people that really stood out during our stay.Frank, Thank you for the amazing hospitality, you anticipated my needs before I did.Linda, your warm and welcoming energy was just icing on the cake for a really nice stay at your property.Dewayne, You went way above and beyond to make sure that I had what I needed. Thank you!Thank you for treating us so well W Austin. Oh hell yeah, I'm coming back."
1,"Rude, unprofessional and an unkept room","I recently had the displeasure of experiencing what appears to be a seemingly nice hotel. It could't have been further from that, upon arrival it was apparent the room had not been cleaned. It looked as if a goblin that been staying there, the sheets were stained green and there was feacal matter around the toilet.. what kind of scumbag weasel does that. After raising the issue, a staff member kicked my camera when it was on the floor."
5,Great Stay,"We had a beautiful room with wonderful amenities. Front door staff is so nice. We really needed a bathtub and they were kind enough to upgrade us to a suite. Room service is good, fast and the food was hot. Great massage! Loved everything about the W. I was a little nervous about staying there because I am not in their demographic but I think anyone would feel welcome and comfortable at this hotel."
5,Fabulous Hotel,"This W property is located next to Austin City Limits and wonderful restaurants, all within easy walking distance.There is a wide selection of rooms and suites.Director of Welcome, FabianRosado, was the most caring and professional, making sure the stay at W Austin was perfect invert way. Highly recommend"
5,LOVED everything about the W!,"This was our first trip to a W hotel and we are hooked---it was outstanding in every area. Staff very helpful and friendly, the room was beautiful with a great view of the water. The decor in the room and throughout the hotel is amazing. Their restaurant food was also very good. We were impressed with every aspect of this hotel and we plan to stay at W's in our future travels throughout the country ."
5,Cool spot in downtown Austin!,Great hotel with all the amenities and a great location .... walking distance to almost everything. Popular bars and pool area....lots of action most nights. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Our corner room was spacious and had a nice view of the pool area. The gym was well equipped. And we always appreciate the style and vibe of the W chain of hotels!
5,Great - as always,"Modern hotel in the middle of Austin downtown. Rooms are pretty and clean, great service during check in and checkout.Gym is very well equipped with state-of-the-art equipment.Looking forward to staying in W again."
2,Expensive parking,Called and made sure we could get connecting rooms and insured after a long time on phone. Then when we arrived no connecting room. Parking is$46 nice and close to congress street bridge to see the bats
1,Worst hotel AND too much money for how awful it is--STAY AWAY,"Where to begin:Drunk, half naked people in the lobby when we checked inWoman bellowing at her boyfriend and cursing at him in the lobbyTold that Austin is not ""geared toward"" familiesTold the hotel is for millennials (which we are not)We came for our teenage daughter's soccer tournament. I should have booked the Four Season's or the Omni. I took a chance on this place b/c it looks good online: DO NOT BE FOOLED. The room was nothing like what I saw online.It is so loud that we cannot even think.A person from the hotel had reached out to me to see if I needed anything beforehand. I told him extra towels, a privacy curtain, and extra pillows. None of these were delivered before we arrived. The shower light was broken. There was blood on the bed (not mine). The room smelled bad. Today, we were out all day, when we got back, our room was not serviced. The maid said that the room was very dirty! She also said there was only a little blood on the sheet. ????My main complaint is that for the exorbitant amount of money, the hotel should be nice, clean, quiet, and stayable. Hotel Zaza is 10,000 times as nice as this piece of crap, and it is much much more inexpensive.I'm mad at myself for subjecting my family to this torture. And shame on W for making this stay like a Girls Gone Wild video mixed with spring break in Ft. Lauderdale.I will never EVER stay at a Marriott or Starwood Hotel again."
5,Great bar!,I stayed here when I was in town for an engagement party but have frequented their bar area often! Rooms are beautiful and staff is so accommodating. The bar is great with strong drinks and great bites-for lunch or late night!
4,"Great location, strange rooms, party scene","The W Austin is everything you would expect. Weekends are filled with trendy people with money or people pretending to have money. There is always a fancy car parked out front of valet. Don't expect you rental Chevy Cruze to make the cut. The staff are great -- well trained in hospitality for sure. They really went above and beyond.The rooms are a bit non traditional. We had two double beds room on the 6 floor. The beds were comfortable and the hall was quiet at night. The bathroom was rather strange. The open concept may work for a romantic couple, but not if you are sharing the room with a friend. The Nespresso machine is a nice touch.The pool was crowded with intoxicated people. Nothing wrong with this, but just a warning to anyone who may book with a family. The DJ was spinning some nice beats.The lounge area is pretty popular at night. It is a good place to grab a drink so long as you do not mind the cost.Location is great. Right downtown. Saturday farmer's market is only three blocks away. Well worth checking out."
4,"Fun hotel, great location, but plan on some noise.","Had a lot of fun here. Great location, very swanky, hip lobby with multiple rooms and fun bar. Lots of partying going on, but upbeat and friendly. Friendly and accommodating staff.Great place to meet up with friends for a fun weekend in Austin.Will be back!"
2,Will not come back,"This hotel has managed to hire great staff. Helpful, attentive and professional. On the other end, I don‚Äôt know what they were thinking when they approved the design and comfort of the rooms. No drawers, just 3 small baskets for your folded clothes. Not even close enough for 1 person staying 5 days. Guess what? There were two of us!!!!No drawers even at the desk. No electric outlet conveniently located unless crawling under the desk is the thing you like to do. If I had wanted to go camping I would have not stayed here.The other good thing, besides the staff, was the food. Was it good enough for me to forget about my involuntary camping? No way!"
4,"Nice place ,good downtown location","We enjoyed our recent stay here. The room was relatively small but well decorated and clean. Pet friendly but we are somewhat spoiled by other high end properties regarding our dog‚Äôs amenities and this hotel only provided a small bag of treats compared to others providing a doggie bed, treats, toys etc.. The hotel appears to cater more to the young business crowd. We had drinks in the Living Room and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere there. If we need to stay in downtown Austin, we I‚Äôll,stay here again."
3,Design shortcomings in room,My 3* review is based on the room product. I didn't have a chance to use the other features of the hotel.The staff was really friendly and would merit 4*.The W holds itself out as a luxury hotel so I judge it on that positioning.Room design defects.Bathroom sink too shallow to reasonably use. Shelf around sink too easily splashed. There's a gap all around the shelf (rather than it going to the walls) so easy for items to fall through.No reading lamps. There are sconce style lamps near the beds but not direct for reading and requires getting out of bed to turn on/off.No desktop outlets. Two electric outlets tucked inconveniently under the desk and no USB outlets. Luxury hotels should have these in place by now.Shower temperature control seemed broken - requiring playing around with it so as not to get scalding water.Phone on desk didn't seem to be working.
5,Love this place!,I have stayed here for business travel a few times. I love it! The location is great (close to bars/restaurants and my office). Very highend (so not good for the price conscience). Friendly staff. Definitely don't need a car if you plan to stay around the hotel
1,Multiple cold showers ... stay elsewhere,"I came to Austin for a weekend with friends. ZERO hot water, none. In fact, all of my buddies had the same issue and the hotel didn't seem to care. Austin is a great city however if when we come back the LAST place we'll be staying or recommending is the W Hotel. To charge $400+ a night and do nothing for a guest is far from good hospitality. Extremely disappointed in the brand. Your standards at this hotel are an embarrassment. Stay elsewhere!"
4,Downtown business hotel,"Great location, comfortable room, great layout (plugs, USB, HDMI). I found the downstairs layout a bit of a maze! Great fitness centre with a full range of machines, nice food (not cheap). I liked the place a lot, I was annoyed by the $40 parking charge but was too lazy to look at alternatives."
4,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here for two nights while visiting Austin on a business trip. The inside of the hotel is beautiful, the pool is nice in the fitness area is pretty large. Everyone is extremely helpful and attentive to your needs. They also have a nice bar area and make good drinks during happy hour time. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars are because my sheets and comforter were made of a material that made me pretty sweaty at night. I put the AC as low as it would go (65) however I still found myself getting extremely warm even just under the sheet. It was a little synthetic feeling. Besides that minor thing this place was wonderful and a great stay."
2,Cold Unwelcoming ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù Hotel,"I spent the last two days at this hotel and was very disappointed. I am a big fan of the Westin brand but this hotel certainly does not live up to that expectation. The hotel, being a LEED silver green hotel has many dark spaces and unfinished concrete surfaces, giving the place a cold minimalist appearance which matches the cold unfriendliness of the staff. In most of my dealings with the front desk staff and the Spa staff, I felt like I was bothering them.At over $400 per night I expected a great room but instead got this small compact minimalistic room with concrete walls. ( This would have fit in well in the old Soviet Union, maybe they used a Russian architectural firm). The bathroom has no door and is open to the room, all rather squashed into one little space. What really makes me crazy in this ‚Äúgreen‚Äù hotel is the shower that is really little more than a trickle. I know the object is to save water but getting the soap and shampoo off requires that you spend an extended amount of time in the shower, eliminating the water savings from the minimal water flow. If you have long hair, I strongly suggest staying elsewhere. I also resent air conditioning that does not function probably due to the required energy savings. Sealed windows do not allow for fresh air on a great day.With all the hotels in Austin, there are far better choices."
1,STOLE MY MEDICATION,"STOLE MY MEDICATION. As an active duty military personal let me be heard. PLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE. I came in for an important stay. I had called ahead and tried to make arrangements so i could have a small comfort when i arrived after my cancer treatment at The Austin Cancer center in Georgetown. I had asked for a cheese plate in my room, i know the check-in process would drain me. Upon arrival not only had my small request been ignored, I found the room to be unfit due to stained pillows and chairs, a dust filter, within 3 feet of my bed, dripping with dust balls. when i asked for a room that was safer for my compromised immune system things when south really fast. The manager took me to a different room, i said i would be comfortable in that room and Thank you. He then left me and my service dog with no room key to either rooms forcing me to sit on the ground and wait for him, no benches in sight on the 4th floor. i was so physically exhausted at this point i was in tears. Chris came and told the people with him that he had told me to wait at the other room. i still had no key to the other room. This is where i get angry. He blatantly lied to make himself look better. i told them that this was unacceptable and i deserved better. Chris and the other manager he had me speak with told me I should LEAVE. Here I am, an hour away from Fort Hood (my home), exhausted from my cancer treatment (that i called ahead and explained), and kicked out of the only luxury experience my modest income would allow. JUST wait, it gets better. The manager met with me in the lobby in front of all the other guest to tell me I could leave the W hotel if i did not like what they offered. I chose to leave and go directly to the Four Seasons. BEST choice i made all day. The manager TOLD me they had placed my belongings in my car and i could go. When i arrived at The Four Seasons and went to my trunk, NONE OF MY BELONGINGS WERE THERE. The Four Seasons arranged to have my items delivered to me. Upon arrival I noticed my medication bag had been tampered with. I looked in and saw that my CANCER narcotics I had been prescribed that day were GONE. When i called the W the security director told me they had reported my bad as abandoned property and the Travis county police department confiscated my medication. When i asked for a property receipt from the police station THEY COULD NOT PRODUCE ONE. They stole my medication and kicked me out in the street."
4,Respectful and attentive managers after uncomfortable incident,"We were greeted by Dwayne, the doorman, who was cheerful, smiling, and respectful. He made a point to introduce us to one manager, Chris, who assured me that if we needed anything, we could call him. That first interaction made me feel comfortable and at ease. Unfortunately, while I was in my room undressing - with the do not disturb sign on the door - a staff member knocked repeatedly. I had to ask him to wait several times, but the knocking did not stop. I finally had to throw on a towel to open the door, only to see a man with a notepad, asking if he could come in to clean. He asked if I was ready for him to come clean the room service tray. I asked him to come back later in which he responded yes. I felt incredibly uncomfortable to the point where I was shaking. I told the employee at the front desk - Tres - who immediately called the other manager, Davis, who sat down with me and listened to my concerns. I explained the situation: as a woman, an employee made me feel at unease in a place I should feel comfortable. I was visibly shaken and disturbed, but David listened to me. He was professional, respectful and understanding of my personal situation. I asked him to explain explicitly the W policy regarding privacy and do not disturb signs. He responded in a straightforward manner, which I appreciated. He investigated the situation and called me shortly after. He assured me that he would do anything to make our stay feel comfortable. He also gifted us one night stay. That night, the staff in the lounge was superb, which was not the case the day or night before. Elliot served us and made a point to make our dining experience enjoyable. Whereas the day and night before, neither the bartender nor waitress would serve us. Even when I asked them for a menu, they either ignored me or said they could not help. This was incredibly inconvenient, as my mother is handicapped. I finally figured it out myself. Despite that, I am very pleased that Davis and the management staff made a point to fix the situation in the lounge. The next day, Davis personally picked up our luggage when it was time for check out. I really appreciated his efforts for us. All together, I am incredibly grateful for the managers and employees who took the time to make me feel comfortable outside my home. Thank you!"
5,Great stay!!,"I had an amazing stay at the W Austin!They really treat their preferred guests well! I am only Gold, but got an upgrade to a suite + 15% off room service, etc. Folks there are super nice and considerate.In addition, they really went beyond the call of duty - my only dress shirt lost a button and they helped me sew it back late at night in just an hour. I was giving a speech the next morning, so they really saved me!Thanks again for a great stay!"
1,"If you don't care for hospitality, stay here","I stayed with friends at the W Hotel in Austin this past weekend April 12-April 15. Our stay at the hotel, which was highly recommended to us, was less than stellar to say the least. The service was not up to par and what I have come to expect from W Hotels. When we arrived, no one asked to take or assist with our luggage. Concierge took a full week to get us information on restaurant recommendations in the area and confirmed our spa treatment reservations the day AFTER we had them. While I had a great facial at the Bliss Spa, the spa itself is less than relaxing with a small waiting area and locker area crowded with noisy women waiting for treatments. In the restaurant, I requested blackened chicken on my salad and the waitress asked me what that was and looked at me like I had two heads. For our troubles, the hotel gave us trail mix and some bottles of water.Really, though, my biggest complaint stems from what is occurring with our room charges. Originally, I had booked two hotel rooms for the night of April 12. On arrival with two friends, we requested adjoining rooms. We were given a handicapped accessible room, which was not requested, and an adjoining room. I gave my credit card and signed for both rooms. After we saw that the one room (Room 910) was a handicap accessible room, we asked to be moved to adjoining non-handicap accessible rooms and we were told the room (one room) would not be ready for an hour and the adjoining room was not available. We agreed to take the one room. After an hour, when we inquired as to the status of the room, the new front desk staff had no clue what we were talking about. The room was not ready until almost 2.5 hours later at 9pm when I got an email that it was ready. We took the keys to ONE new room ONLY, were never given keys to the other room which was to be adjoining or any other room in the hotel. We all shared a room that evening and I was NEVER told that we would be charged for a room we were never given and never took possession of. The next afternoon, when two more friends checked into the hotel, they checked into the second room and were given the keys. Long story short, the night of the 12th, we were given only ONE room. The night of the 13th and 14th, we had TWO rooms. On checkout when we were billed for two rooms on the night of the 12th, the manager refused to refund us the money for the unused room which we never had access to or make any concession because I had signed for two rooms and given my credit card. To me, this indicates a major lapse in service, an oversight and lack of clear communication on the part of the hotel and its front desk staff, if not outright fraud.Starwood Corporate Customer Service is equally non-accommodating and clueless. Really really disappointing and I'm OK with paying for the one night of a hotel room that we were never given because I'm positive that my reviews of the awful service at this hotel will cost them more than just one customer."
5,Had a great stay!,"Loved the rooms! Loved the decor! We had a great stay, we didn't choose this hotel, it was chosen for us as a business meeting, but we would definitely chose to stay here again. The room was large and spacious, the bathroom was large and spacious. Service was great. I took pictures of the room as we are currently remodeling our house, and loved the decor that much! We enjoyed our meals at the restaurant. The lounge was fabulous, we had a large group of us- 12 and the couches were fabulous to gather on. Thanks for a great stay!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have a love/ hate relationship with the W, but a deal is a deal so I held my breath and went with it.Was extremely pleased. Room was lovely, all the W amenities you expect and love. Including a martini shaker !Gym was fantastic !! Pool area gorgeous.Staff was helpful without being over the top.And great location.One of the better W‚Äôs if not the best."
5,Perfection.,"Just left another wonderful stay here. Have stayed here several times now for day trips down to Austin and it never disappoints. Theres a reason the W is my favorite downtown Austin hotel. The location can‚Äôt be beat, a cabana by the pool in the summer is always worth the money, and the beds are by far my favorite at any hotel. I love being able to get drinks just downstairs at the bar and people watch but retreat upstairs to quiet rooms. From the valet to front desk, everyone is super friendly. This time we were lucky enough to be checked in by the manager on duty, Chris who couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly and offered some helpful recommendations for live music. Another perfect stay at W Austin."
4,"Dark, but not in a scary way!","We were in Austin for one night on our way to The Woodlands. We had a balcony which was lovely. The hotel hallways are pretty dark with the dark red/gray scheme, but the rooms are bright and cheery. We had to ask for a curtain because the shower doesn't have a door (the toilet does). With two teenage girls, we needed the added privacy, but they have them available and brought them right up. There is a close parking lot for $28 a night with in / out availability. The dog policy is a little ridiculous though. It's $100 deposit (refundable), $100 for PAW Program (non refundable) and $25 additional per night. So for one night, the cost of a room roughly $300 and a dog $125 is a little steap. If I'd recognized that as the pet policy, I'd have stayed somewhere else. The concierge did give our old lady a pooch box, but it still wasn't worth $125.00."
4,Chic Hangout,One of my hotel lobby stops during SXSW. This hotel is ultra modern and the first one built for the next generation of young partygoers. It is a cool pool scene and the lobby is sleek. The bar and lounge areas are nice and comfortable. The parking valet in front is like bird watching but for European exotic cars.It is appended to the Austin City Limits music venue. So if planning to attend a show there this hotel is the place to stay. It is considered a luxury hotel so you will be pampered nicely and has excellent security making you feel very safe. The concierge was very helpful with some questions we had and after resting in the lounge we headed off.
5,Perfect stay in Austin!,"After a lot of research and debate, we booked the W Hotel for our three night, long weekend trip. We couldn't be happier with what we got. Our stay exceeded all expectations and was the perfect complement to a relaxing and fun trip.The location is super central and right downtown and on the Colorado River. We were able to walk to almost every attraction and felt comfortable in the area even at night. There are many amazing restaurants right around the corner and if you are going to a concert at ACL, it's the next building over. Cross a couple of streets and you are in a whole other world down on the Lady Bird river trail.Check in was smooth. They actually even upgraded us to an amazing corner suite facing the river. The room was clean and the Bliss products were awesome. The gym, pool and spa were as good as it gets for a hotel. Every staff member went out of their way to greet and help us out.Would definitely stay here again. Thanks W Austin!"
4,Location Above All Else,"The hotel is well located near river park and area amenities. Standard guest rooms are very small and I would suggest upgrading to a suite. Lobby is a bit cold and the elevators are slow, but the rooftop pool area, spa and fitness center area excellent. Staff is friendly and overall a very nice hotel."
5,Great rooms and location!,I stayed at the W for a conference and it was wonderful. It is close to several dining locations and night life. The rooms were very comfortable and they were more than accommodating when I didn't feel well and needed room service. I would highly recommend the W!
4,Very nice and well located,"The W Austin is a high rise luxury hotel in an area near lots of bars, restaurants and music venues north of the river and just to the south of the Capitol and the University of Texas. As is typical of W hotels the lobby and common areas are hip and modern with house music and funky lighting. The bar is glowing red and has a cool vibe. The rooms are larger than average with big views of Austin. The rooms have updated technology and plenty of outlets both electrical and USB. The bathrooms are new and very nice and functional. It‚Äôs a good choice if you want to be in this Second Street District Downtown Area."
4,AWAY SPA at The W Hotel,"Just had a massage facial at at the AWAY SPA and want to compliment the amazing massage therapist, Wendy! She was lovely, considerate, most professional and gave me one of the best massages ever. The SPA staff was also very courteous and promptly saw to my needs. Thanks so much. The only downside was the tight quarters that limited the spa serenity, especially because it is also a corridor to the fitness center! Bottom line-- Spa personnel were excellent but design and planning of space and logistics were quite poor. That said, I will go back because of the high quality service, but have to rate it 4 out of 5 because of the poorly planned facility."
3,Disappointed,"I have stayed at a number of W around the world and I am generally a great fan of the brand. However, W Austin was not up to the standards of my previous stays at other W hotels. The room was poorly maintained with the bathroom door falling off its rails which made it very difficult to close. The room also had a strange smell and the shower needed a refresh."
4,Very Good Hotel,"The W hotel in Austin really surprised us. The rooms were very cool and trendy, the bars were excellent, the staff was top notch, and the pool was super popping. The W can be very hit or miss, but I would DEFINITELY visit this one again. If you can, get a room with a balcony. This hotel is also walking distance to alot of the cool things you'd want to do in Austin."
4,Decorated very nicely,"First off, there is NO BATHROOM door to separate it from main area. Just want to get that out there. So you aren‚Äôt shocked when you walk in. That‚Äôs why this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars. Luckily the toilet is in it‚Äôs own room with a door...but not the shower. Sorry, I just find that strange. Hotel staff is very friendly and the location is awesome! Park in the garage across the street for $21 and save $20 ( hotel charges $41 plus tax). Hotel was quiet but then again it was a Monday night. Air worked great once I turned off the econo mode. Love all the USB plugs by the bed, nice touch. TV worked great and bed was very comfortable. This hotel is SUPER CLEAN! I would stay here again, as long as it‚Äôs with someone who can see me just out of the shower."
5,Great service and beautiful rooms!,"The personal services were really unexpected and lovely! I received an email from the concierge a week before my arrival. He wanted to know if I needed any help etc during my stay. I let him know I was in for the 3M half marathon and asked whether there was a good place to watch the Patriots Championship game while I was there. He was super responsive, helpful and personable. Upon arrival, my room was upgraded and there was a guest arrival amenity that was so sweet and personalized. Delicious trail mix for running, water, a note of good luck, etc. What a warm touch upon arrival. I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. My room was gorgeous, comfortable and had a big bathtub for an epsom soak after the run. Great experience and improved my overall impression of the W Hotel chain!"
2,Unfortunate issues with a great hotel,"When we checked in, we selected keyless access to go strait to our room. Unfortunately we were told we would have to see the front desk to do a more involved checkin to get the process running for the first time.20 min in line with only one person at the desk we were finally checked in.Then we get in to shower and there are chunks of black stuff all over the bottom of the shower. Unsure if they cleaned the room. Had to clean the shower ourselves.Lastly. We had late checkout and had the staff check by our room 2 times at 11 and noon, while we had the do not disturb sign up to ask if we were checking out.Like I said, unfortunate for such a great hotel chain. I think we‚Äôll switch to another SPG hotel next time."
5,Great place,3rd time here on business. At least the second time they have upgraded me to a corner suite with amazing views. And on business their readiness to agree to the late checkout at the time I wanted was really appreciated. Made my stay enjoyable. This W is a place I want to spend time when I‚Äôm away from home. I love the staff and I like the vibe. A really good choice in Austin
5,Great Hotel,"My husband and I went for an extended weekend to Austin in January 2018. We were supposed to see a concert that ended up being canceled because the lead singer had the flu. We chose this hotel because it was close to the venue. Even though the show was canceled the location of the hotel was great. It was near restaurants, small grocery markets, Starbucks (we visited everyday) and 6th Street. The hotel staff was very welcoming and the atmosphere was very nice. Our room had a view of downtown. It was comfortable and quite nice. We would definitely stay there again next time we venture to Austin."
5,Very pleasant hotel,"I spent four nights here and really liked the quirky nature of the hotel. The staff were very pleasant and went above and beyond.I had a two day conference here and the banqueting staff were superb, probably the best I have experienced. Always on hand and very attentive.Enjoyed brunch and loved the dinner I had there too.Comfy beds too!To their credit, I had a small issue which was sorted swiftly and the took it very seriously and went above and beyond the call of duty to correct it. Will certainly stay again."
5,Good place,Nice stay in downtown Austin. Close to everything. Large facility with very nice interior and cool terrace by the pool. The restaurant was also good. Check out quiet library as a getaway. The hotel was a good choice.
5,Above and beyond all expectations,Can't say enough about the excellent service and hospitality at this W hotel. Impeccable service started before we even arrived - Frank Everet took care of every detail and made our stay even more fabulous than we thought it could be. Everyone from check-in to check-out made us feel special and welcomed. The W staff really cares about the guest experience - you know it was amazing when you can't stop smiling 4 days after your stay. Thanks Frank and team!
1,Rude Front Desk and Welcome manager: Never been treated so poorly,"It has taken me a while to write this. Well actually I did write a review to American Express Fine hotels. Never made it past the front desk--after a long day of travel, walked in to the hotel and had about an hour to shower and change and drive to a wedding 45 min away. I made this reservation under our Amex Platinum fine hotels travel program, which I use frequently. The reservation was made with my husbands name, who missed the flight and was arriving later that evening. The reservation was under His Name, MY cell and MY email address. They would not give me the room due to security reasons, I pleaded with them to call American Express since I am on the account -they refused! The Welcome Manager was extremely Smug and Rude--He actually offered to CANCEL in my husbands name but wouldn't let me check in...Makes no sense what so ever, I literally walked out crying --as He held the door and literally laughed at me --Walked to JW marriott in Austin...They were so welcoming, and so upset that I had a horrible experience. They gave me the best rate--bought me lunch and got me checked in within minutes..and out to the wedding on-tme. The lobby is much nicer and welcoming When I called American express, they were shocked and appalled that the W Austin would just outright cancel my room -and no accommodate with me with checking in to a room, they should be removed from amex fine hotels, which is my go to for hotel recommendations. Don't waste your time with this hotel! I travel frequently and I must say this was by far the worst experience I ever had. The Staff needs serious training in guest relations."
4,"Great, fun weekend!","Quick trip to meet a friend in Austin, and we stayed here. The service began, when the valet correctly guessed (in a crazy busy line) who my friends were, and sent them to the bar to meet me! While in the lobby, we met a friendly group, who wanted to meet up at the pool later. The room was wonderful, clean, with a great view of downtown Austin. We went to the pool bar, and enjoyed the rooftop views. The bar downstairs was not only aesthetically pleasing, it was a fun spot, and so nice to end the evening so close to our rooms! Overall great stay!"
2,Poor Value,"We had tickets to see Willie Nelson at the Austin City Limits Moody Theater on New Years Eve so, not being familiar with Austin, we booked a room at the adjoining W Hotel. That turned out to be a mistake. There are other much lower priced hotels within easy walking distance. Booking the room a month in advance was a particularly bad mistake, because the rates had gone down considerably by the time we checked in, as the hotel was not near full. The ‚Äúcozy‚Äù room we got was tiny, and pretty unremarkable considering the high price. We thought maybe because we had paid a premium for the room they might give us an upgrade to a king bed, but no such luck. In fact the reception we got was very unwelcoming, both the cold feel of the lobby and the reception clerk. We certainly won‚Äôt stay at a W Hotel again."
5,Great location,What a great hotel in a fantastic location. The roof top pool great for adults. The roof top bar has great drinks. The hotel is about a 15 min walk to the water. This a great hotel to have a small work meeting.
5,W Hotel never disappoints. A memorable and inspirational visit.,"Spending a night in a Corner Suite is a vacation in itself. The very chic, large living room, bedroom and bathroom space, overlooks downtown Austin. The downstairs lounge & restaurant makes you never want to leave."
3,Odd evening vibe for luxury hotel,"I found the vibe in the lounge and bar areas to be that of a nightclub, not that of a luxury hotel. While they are trying to be a cross between a boutique hotel and something larger, the bar scene consists of wonderful drinks, the ability to reserve space and have a dance floor on Saturday evening. The crowd however was solidly from outside the hotel. They have a DJ mixing fun tunes but there were several people roaming the different rooms and our large group was constantly concerned that they were casing the place ready to take off with a handbag the moment you turned your head. Not fun, relaxing or luxurious."
5,A great hotel and restaurant,The hotel has it all. The service is great. The hotel is centrally located. If you like to run there is a lake running path a block away. The restaurant was fabulous. Our waiter W. Plomtheius gave outstanding service. The Service and food was so good that my daughter booked a reservation the next day for 9 people who were going to the theater a mile away. The art work and decor is very unusual and interesting.
5,Super helpful and friendly staff,"I didn't actually stay at the hotel but will in the future, the staff were amazing! I needed help and Frank E. went above and beyond the call of duty to assist me even though I was not a guest. Left a huge impression will stay at this location in the future based on this interaction. Thank you, Frank!"
5,Loved it!,"Exceptional service from the moment we got out of the car! Trey, the bellman, was so friendly and very engaged! You do not find people with that level of genuine caring often. The hotel is beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay. Will be back!"
5,Great stay at the W,We loved our stay at the W. Hats off to Frank the Insider. Really went above and beyond. The hotel is in a perfect location in downtown. Lots to do around the hotel. The room was great and the bathroom was one of the better hotel bathrooms I have ever had. We will be back.
5,Wedding weekend,"Good location with walk or short ride to many hot spots. Fresh, contemporary and comfortable. Our room was well appointed and spotless. Staff was welcoming, concierge was very helpful. Great spaces for wedding events. Enjoyed the restaurant too."
5,Finally a great W,"Just so you know, I really don't like the W hotels in general. Most hotels are more concerned with being a nightclub than a hotel. The W Austin is a jewel. The night club aspect was kept up front and to the side and once you hit the front desk it was all hotel.Upon arrival the valet staff is friendly, even if you are just picking up or dropping off. Check in is a breeze and right next to the elevators. The classic Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening rugs were in place at the elevators and swapped out as time of day dictated.Once in the room, I felt like I had room to spread out and relax. A lot of W's will fill the room with stuff they are trying to sell you and other junk to get in the way. I had a nice big desk with power so I could get work done in my room.My only complaint was that when the TV turned on it was programmed to the hotel channel and that channel was twice as loud as every other channel. I tent to turn the TV on and never change the channel.The area is great. Tons of restaurants and things to do around the area. The bridge with the bats is only a couple of blocks away. I found the Ginger Man bar nearby that was my hang out place for a couple of nights. The hotels is also attached to Austin City Limits, so if you plan on going to a show, plan to stay here."
5,Highly recommend,"Stayed at the W for an overnight trip to Austin. Had an unexpected upgrade to a room overlooking the river, which was a wonderful view, especially as this was my first trip to the city. The room itself was quite spacious, nicely decorated, immaculate, and had all amenities you might need to those that were very nice-to-have (espresso machine, complementary bottled water, hair drier, iron, etc).The location for me was fantastic. Close to the businesses I was visiting, but equally, near a myriad of bars and restaurants, all with great food and options if you wanted to stray from the hotel.The hotel itself was quite nice. They had several communal lobby areas, so you could hang out at the bar, or move to the quieter library-like rooms, each with a cozy fireplace.Service was top notch. Every single person I encountered was friendly, pleasant, and very helpful.Overall a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back."
4,Super nice.,"The hotel is great. The location is also great. Staff nice. Room super nice, clean and comfortable.2 areas to improve on. The mini bar, an absolute rip off. 8$ for a bag of chips. Really? The car valet, need major improvement. My 1st day I call for my car and they guess who I was and brought the wrong car down. Official explanation was that I sounded like a resident. Second day, gave them my valet number, they can‚Äôt find my car. For $40 a day to park you have to do better. But all and all a great stay."
5,Excellent Customer Service,"We stayed at the W for my daughter 22nd Birthday. The GM Drew Mcquade sent up a nice card and Birthday cake upon arrival.The Front Desk was very friendly and helpful, Caleb help us out and her really took the time to make us feel welcomed!!Love the location!! Can't wait to go back!"
5,Great hotel,"Loved staying at the W when we visited Austin for the weekend . Walking distance to all the restaurants , bars , and the lake. Rooms were very nice and clean . Towels aren‚Äôt great - need new ones . Staff at the front are friendly. Great hotel - will stay here again !"
5,Amazing!,"The resort top to bottom is amazing! This hotel exemplifies what it means to be a classy establishment. Rooms are great, the eating and drinking areas are awesome, especially the living room area! A++"
5,Nice!,"Honestly this hotel was very nice! Bathrooms were huge and up to date, beds comfortable, staff friendly, walking distance to a ton of eating and coffee places! Would come back! Only thing is pool can get loud so early sleep is not an option."
4,2% or Half and half,"This is a mixed review but has more to do with the SPG app and their customer service response.Let me start by saying the desk staff, Davis, and check in experience were top notch. As was the the Valet service where all the staff was better than most, speedy response and always a smile ... Great location as well.The property for the most part was what you'd expect from a W as far as design and great energy.Still some small things at the hotelbothered me in addition to what I feel was a misdirection by SPG and their explanation. Full disclosure I am a Gold preferred and generally a Brand supporter.At the hotel I was on the 9th floor. As I stepped off the elevator I noticed the AED case was hanging on the wall but the case was empty. Hey at my age I notice things like that ...The room very comfortable, as expected and clean but the mattress cover was bunched up, I found myself stripping the lower sheet to smooth it out to get comfortable.Not a big deal but neither is ""a little"" sand in your shoe.As for the SPG issue, it goes like this, most brand apps promise the most competitive price but in this case I found a price on an a major travel sight that was just under $200 less. I found that hard to believe so I went back to the app. in make sure I wasn't missing something. I booked using the aggregators sight.When I checked in I was of course informed I would NOT receive the usual items I've come to expect like point credit or even any credit for the stay at all. This was just an overnight, but we are developing this market so I understand I will be back but for this trip not worth getting upset over.I called SPG I usually wouldn't and now wish I hadn't, to be told if I wanted a price match I would have had to had filled out a form and bla, bla, bla whatever! I'm not much for happy talk really. No disrespect meant I prefer you do something or don't but don't try to excuse what's unexcusable. At the end of the conversation I was left wishing I had made a better choice. I have started to travel a lot on business again these days so I have been trying all the brands again to find ""my place""In the end this experience has seen me deleting the SPG app from my phone as I don't feel it has been designed with my best interest in mind!Maybe the Marriott people will effect some change to more reflect the experience of using their app ... Too bad really as I've recently stayed at least 3 Aloft properties in smaller markets like Greenville SC, and really like the room lay out.Regardles, I'm retiring my SPG app, status and Brand. I shouldn't have to beg or search for a rate match, PERIOD.It's certainly not the hundred and eighty bucks, more a lack of respect for the fact it's my hundred eighty dollars, which I likely would have spent on food and drinks anyway. In this case I chose to eat off the premises. If I have to play shoots and ladders, we use to call the game ""snakes"" and ladders, to find there is a better price available on the net I don't feel the brand is actually investing in my loyalty. Quite the opposite ... I'm not a discount shopper but I'm not a fool either.It begs the question, is there any real value in placing my confedence or loyalty commitment to a system this system that offered little to help ensure I at least got the best value available on that day in that property.I'm not going to go on about this but I am disappointed. Some of you will appreciate this, others will think I'm being silly or even petty when I say what I feel is more a sense of loss, than anger. Giving up on a brand you once identified with is like moving out of a house and away from neighbors you liked.I do want to reiterate the Hotel and staff at the W in Austin provided a great experience, I am appreciative of that.Next up Medford OR for two nights then on to a Marriott Courtyard in downtown Seattle for four nights next week.Happy Thanksgiving Y'all!"
2,Basic,"Thought I was buying special. Instead, basic hotel room. Up-side was the undying scent of lemon in the room. Clean room - design cold/grey. Pool freezing cold - not swimmable. Nice doorman - always smiling. Not thrilled by stay at hotel - really? - multiple dollars for 7-11 bag of m'n'm's; $13+ for glass of cheap wine. Won't return and will not recommend."
5,Literally THE BEST NEW YEAR'S EVE EVER!,"HO-LY COW. So, my wonderful husband sprung for really swanky tickets to the W for New Year's Eve. We live in the area, but love to stay downtown on NYE to avoid the roads and to be close to all of the fun. When we were checking in at the W Austin, the concierge kept complimenting my husband on his choice of room (""Excellent choice, sir.""). We both thought our room was a slightly upgraded room, so the gushing seemed a little over-the-top. I just figured they made everyone feel like royalty.Um, maybe they do treat everyone like royalty, but seriously. No. This was not a ""slightly upgraded room"". This room was some Oprah kind of room....look it up (the Extreme Wow Suite). When we walked in, we were blown away and realized why the concierge (Justin) was making such a big deal about our reservation. Honestly, I didn't get too settled in at first because I thought for sure it was some kind of mistake. I mean, ZZ Top was staying in the hotel that night and I felt bad because their room probably wasn't as nice as ours.Don't get me wrong...my husband I was accustomed to the finer things in life and regularly travel, but the W Austin has definitely ruined us for life as no other hotels will live up to the magic we experienced. The room had two king sized bedroom suites (on opposite sides), and a separate service entrance and butler's pantry. The bathroom was a spectacle unto itself with a huge stand-alone tub, a gorgeous view of the lake, and a shower that would easily accommodate four people (I don't know this for certain, obviously, but that would be my guess). This was luxury at its finest. The mini-bar even had canned pure oxygen (I'm not sure why, but that resonated with me as something the ""other half"" must enjoy).At any rate, our upgrade turned out to be a once in a lifetime deal and it truly made for the best New Year's Eve EVER. We loved our room, got a gorgeous view of the fireworks over Town Lake as we prepared for our evening, and then we danced the night away at the Neon Gold Party. It was perfection!The next morning, I took the longest, most luxurious shower in the history of showers (I can neither confirm nor deny that a full grown woman can do a snow angel in the shower). Before checking out, we lounged downstairs amid an intoxicating mix of house music and the smell of maple syrup and helped ourselves to mimosas and pancakes. (Incidentally, we also saw ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons that morning and gave him a knowing look because we now knew what it felt like to party like rockstars in the penthouse.)Thank you, W Austin, for giving us one of the best experiences of our lives. The service (and clearly the accommodations) were first-rate. If you're looking to ring in the new year in style, you'd be crazy to go anywhere else. And, who knows? You just may end up getting the upgrade of a lifetime!"
5,Awesome staff -- very helpful when I forgot my workout shoes,"The location of the W is awesome. It's the standard W look and feel on the inside, which is fun, but it's the staff that makes all of the difference at this location. They were friendly and courteous right from when I arrived, but it was my post-stay customer experience that pushed this into 5-star territory for me.Right when I arrived home and unpacked, I realized that I had forgotten my shoes. I called the hotel, and Colton, the lead security supervisor, found them and had them shipped out by the next business day. He even included a luggage tag (a hit with my 4 year-old). Also, props for the business card with the W Austin's TripAdvisor. I'm not great at remembering to write reviews, I'm usually just a consumer on this site.In this case, this is a 5-star rating well deserved. Thanks to Colton and the rest of the staff. Can't wait until work brings me back to Austin again soon.Hook 'em!"
2,Away Spa Thumbs Down,"I‚Äôm in the middle of a three night stay at the W Austin as I write this review. The hotel staff is very friendly. The room is alright - bed is comfortable, but there is a glaring lack of storage and the bathroom is open concept. When my husband had to get up at 6:00 am to get ready for meetings, I was awoken by lights and noise from the bathroom, as there isn‚Äôt a bathroom door.I had a free morning, so I decided to check out the spa. Very disappointed. The facilities are cramped and run down. The locker that I was given to use literally fell off of the hinges when I opened it. The floor of the shower was moldy. I booked a body treatment which was given by a gentleman who basically rushed through the treatment and actually hit me in the head as he was transitioning from the use of one product to another. He rattled and banged equipment within the room. It was very noisy and not relaxing at all. The last half hour of the treatment he must have realized he had rushed and still had time to kill so he repeated previous parts of the massage. The treatment overall had no rhyme or reason (did a mini-facial and didn‚Äôt put any product on my nose or upper lip?) and seemed very haphazard. I frequent high-end spas on a regular basis. For the price of the treatment, I expected better facilities and a better-trained therapist. I was asked if I wanted to leave a 20% tip. That was tacky. They should have asked if I would like to leave a tip. I left 15%, because the therapist was friendly if not skilled."
5,W Hotel - Austin - #1 Downtown Hotel,"The W Hotel never disappoints from the first touch to the last. The valet, bell staff, and front desk were awesome from arrival, daily to departure. The room met all W Hotel standards: clean, well-appointed and super cool. The hotel is located downtown so you can walk to everything from great BBQ to the best music spots. We did not take make it to the spa or pool but the looked pretty awesome. I highly recommend the Austin W Hotel for business or pleasure."
2,Lost a Regular,"It saddens me to have to write this review but after last night's experience at the W it has to be done. As a local I've done everything at this W BUT spent the night. I've stayed at other W hotels and have been extremely impressed especially by the customer service where this hotel is seriously lacking. I regularly use the pool, spa, eat at Trace and use their Valet as well (which I don't know are hotel employees or contracted out honestly). No one seems to be on the same page here and if you are not staying the night even if you are dropping money there you are treated quite differently.The hotel reeks of pretentiousness lately. It's a newbie on the Austin scene and at a few hundred bucks a pop a night for a basic room they certainly act they they are the best in the game and they really could care less if you disagree especially if you don't have the money to back up your opinion. I may not roll up in an Aston Martin and demand get prompt service but when I'm here it's usually for a special reason and I'm spending hard earned money and expect to be treated accordingly. I've never felt like such a bum walking off the street into a hotel as I do at this place and it's not a welcoming feeling. Even calling the front desk to confirm a reservation and ask a question left me with a bad taste.Now for specifics. The valet last night tried to charge me a ridiculous amount for the service even though I was well under the ""3 hour rule"". They had the time entered in wrong and instead of checking with the restaurant or someone there he made me list all of the things we ate and drank for dinner.....really? Do I look like such a degenerate that I can't afford a meal at this place? That was a first. No vouchers are given at the restaurant for parking and we even double checked with our server during dinner, who said she would ask someone else, we were told there was a flat rate. So regardless there seems to be a lack of communication going on. Speaking of dinner, upon entering the restaurant absolutely no one greeted us. Everyone looked, but no one greeted.....We stood around awkwardly until the hostess arrived and instead of starting with ""good evening how are you"" it was ""Do you have a reservation?"" Cut right to biz....because if you don't have a reservation I don't have to be nice to you or make an attempt to accommodate you? We did have a reservation and were thus seated promptly at one of the MANY open tables where we received service from a woman who seemed like she REALLY did not want to be there. The food is always great and the drinks are OK. I don't know that i'll be going out of my way to bring out of town guests here again though.As far as the pool and spa go, both are nice. The employees at the spa seem to have their stuff together and are very helpful. The pool staff is about the same as the restaurant staff. Unless you're sitting in a cabana getting bottle service don't expect that ""Above and beyond"" service. I walked from the pool to the spa in my swimsuit and was promptly told I needed to put clothes on for the 10 feet I had to walk to then get undressed for a spa service.... The pool is very small and get's pretty crowded. It is a place to ""see and be seen"" but after all of the experiences tied together I'm good with not being seen there anymore.I had really looked forward to spending a date night, birthday, special occasion etc night at the W at some point. The location is fabulous. But I'll save my money and re-visit one of the many hotel options downtown Austin has to offer."
4,Review for Away Spa at the W - Locals Special,"I've lived in Austin for over 25 years and I have found the best place and price for brow wax and lash tint! The locals special Monday - Thursday at the Away Spa in the W hotel. Free valet parking! Shelly C is the BEST! I hate to tell you her name, as she will be even harder to book but she is crazy wonderful OCD - in a great way, when it comes to brows. The Spa lounge area is very nice and great lockers. The steam shower is awkward, as it shares the space with the shower and has one small bench. It would be nice if they had a dry sauna or a more of a user friendly steam sauna area."
5,"aWesome W, so sweet you can eat it","I'm an SPG Awards & Marriott Awards Member, I live in DT Austin, and stay-cay often at the W, love my staff there!!! Unobstructed views on the south side of the W, best gym/spa, but then again, they have an Aussie Dynamo run'n the joint, love the staff across the board, ya can't beat the location & you can get IT whenever whatever W is XLNT!"
4,Friendly and prompt service,"This is a ""swanky"" hotel that's not my personal choice, but I stayed here on business for a conference. It's a little above my typical price range, and I like to stay at a different major name hotel chain.I put in a couple requests at the front desk before my stay, and I was happy and appreciate that the hotel obliged. The front desk staff was always pleasant and greeted me whenever I came by (check in, whenever I left for sightseeing or back from dinner, etc.).The TV in my room didn't work so I called the front desk. They sent a nice gentleman to my room to look into it. Apparently a cord was loosely connected so he fixed it. Also gave me a different remote with new batteries. Worked like a charm. I didn't really ""need"" the TV, but it was nice that they responded so quickly and politely.I ordered room service one night of my stay and it was delicious! Prompt delivery and exactly what I ordered.The one thing that was a little odd was the bed sheet. There wasn't a fitted sheet, but rather a flat sheet on top of the mattress pad. I think it was put on sideways, since it kind of hung down to the floor, and when I was sleeping it would creep up at the foot of the bed, exposing the mattress pad. I was too lazy to fix it myself, and I chose to forgo housekeeping (as I usually do).The room was clean and had everything you'd normally expect in a hotel room. It was a nice stay, rather quiet (I had asked for a quiet area of the hotel). Actually slept 10 hours my first night there! I would stay here again if I'm back in Austin, for business or pleasure."
3,Great location but now tired,"Location is perfect for getting around Austin, but other newer hotels beat it now, prices are not low and you can see bar areas are not as full as in previous years. People have moved away. Needs a revamp and a new look and identity. Competition in Austin is getting greater. Staff were great and room service good and speedy . If you can get a good price good, if not, there are better now."
4,Amazing concierge team!,"Just wanted to give a special shout out to Frank and his awesome concierge team at the W Hotel Austin. We were in Austin, last month, celebrating my sister's bachelorette party and he and his team were amazing in helping me plan the perfect weekend. From arranging transportation to Lake Travis, to booking dinner reservations, to decorating the room they were superstars! Thank you all for making it even more amazing :)"
2,Wouldn‚Äôt stay again,"Thermostat control was lackluster, unable to lower the temp to a comfortable level even after 10 hours. Water pressure is nonexistent in the shower but water still gets a 3 foot parameter wet outside the shower. Bed is hard, not much softer than the floor. Bed Pillows offer little variety. Minibar is stocked, not allowing for storage of my own items. Room is dimmly lit even with all lights on and most lights not on a wall switch. Tv does not offer many channels. Alarm clock loses about 4 minutes a day in time. On the bright side, the free WiFi is decent. Good location. Good restaurant and bar."
4,"Great location, consistent W","Good hotel, great location in the heart of downtown Austin. I am kinda over the W vibe though, it doesn't feel fresh or innovative anymore. They did give guitar pic shaped room keys which was novel and their mini bar selection is good. Neither would make me come back -underscoring my point about W's need to innovate."
4,Can we stop with the open concept now,"That's my only complaint - no door to the entrance of the bathroom. We needed maintenance in our room one night but we also wanted to shower since we'd been gone all day in the hot sun at the ACL Festival, but we had to sit there and wait for maintenance to show up on their own sweet time because had he walked in while one of us was showering - can you say free peep show? Annoying! But everything else was fine with the room ^_^"
3,"Not very impressed, gym was nice","This hotel has a great location and gym, but the rooms and service you can find elsewhere for half the price. The bar on the bottom floor is nice and location is close to E 6th ST if you wanna go out you can walk there."
5,"Chill Vibe, Groovy Hotel","I was attending a conference and was pleasantly surprised by this nicely located, awesome property. I arrived early and they got me into my room early. I was in 608 which was very large and had a balcony that four people could comfortably lounge on. Others in my group did not get the same deal. Some rooms are much smaller. If you want outside space it seems to be only a few floors in the even numbered rooms. Awesome toiletries including face wash. Two robes, which always make me happy. There‚Äôs no door on the bathroom. There‚Äôs one for the toilet but it‚Äôs all pretty much hanging out when you get out of the shower. People traveling in pairs hated this. There are odd things that bugged my colleagues but I didn‚Äôt mind, like very tight sink space and no drawers. The lobby is mostly made up of a series of comfy seating areas and bars that were very inviting. The pool area was lovely and urban."
5,So Divine At Happy Hour Time,"My co-worker and I frequent the W for happy hour (we are locals) because the staff is friendly and the food is great - especially for the low prices. They always have the best DJs and I think I'm a bit picky when it comes to music for my HH setting! Several different atmospheres all in one... the record room, red room, living room, patio, etc. so something for whatever mood strikes. I like that the crowd isn't too young, there's a good variety of people who come through. We often meet people staying at the hotel from out of town and local residents who live there, both. It's our go-to spot (or at least starting spot), and one of the reasons I've grown so fond of Austin's social scene."
4,"Great location, very chic, but if you 65 - the shower/tub can be challenging","The hotel is beautiful, extremely modern and the location on Lavaca is fantastic for getting around Austin. Also right at ACL so a great entertainment alternative. The room for the price was reasonable but the tub/shower combination is the size of a shower stall so if you wanted to take a bath you would have to do it sitting up - and it is a high step into the tub. Also, since the tub/shower is in the open and not behind a closed door it could get cold when you step out into the main room.All in all a very good place to stay"
1,Flash over substance,"I was excited to stay at the W, it looks cool and very trendy but feel that this place is flash over substance!!The couple of great things going for this hotel is the service of the events team that were at the conference I was attending (they were fantastic) and those at the hotel restaurant were great! The bar and lounge area are cool too.Here's the negative stuff...I arrived late night at 11.30pm and was was welcomed by a pretty cold receptionist who didn't deliver a warm welcome, it was no better than the typical copy and paste welcome you would get at a 2* star hotel, nothing unique, different or personal. I was staying for 3 nights and did ask the receptionist if I could have a slightly later checkout when I leave as I was attending a conference in the same hotel and wanted to be able to freshen up before leaving for the airport but was simply told that the checkout time was the standard time and that I could just leave my luggage with reception who could hold it for me till I left. Its funny that I asked a different receptionist the day after and he was able to put a slightly later checkout time for me which really helped me, frustrating this couldn't have been done on my initial request when I first arrived.The room itself looked great but please note the bathrooms are open with no doors so probably ideal for couples but if you're on a twin option sharing with a friend, then just make sure your comfortable with that level of openness! The shower head power could be stronger and more room around the sink area would be great!The lighting in the room is annoying, as there is no master switch off button by the bedroom area (if there was one, I couldn't find it!) so you need to get out of bed and switch the mains off by the front door. The bedside lamps are on the wall and are quite high up so you would need to get out of bed to twist the light switch on or off, just seemed fiddly and not easy to do.My room was not serviced after the first night, which wasn't such an issue but on the second day I saw a hotel maid a few doors down in the corridor and asked her ""Are you please able to service my room today as it wasn't yesterday?"", to that she replied ""sorry, no English""... thats's not what you would expect from at a hotel of this level... this got resolved eventually when I spoke with reception but why employ someone who doesn't understand the basics of English? Baffled!On the last day when I was checking out, my hotel room was meant to be covered on the event account of the conference that I was attending but they did not have this on their records. I appreciate there was a disconnect in communication somewhere so no blame game here but my frustration here was that after waiting around trying to solve the problem for 20 minutes, I didn't get an apology for waiting, a thank you for staying or a help with bags or to the airport from the receptionist. I was simply given and told here is your invoice and that was it, I didn't say anything and just left... a cold ending just like the cold welcome I got."
5,a delightful stay,"this is one cool hotel. booked thru the amex FH program with all sorts of little treats and benefits. thought as it turned out, booking a few months ahead turned out to be way more expensive than booking a few days ahead, my bad, but something to note. room was great, only lacking bath and weirdly, no slippers. such an annoying oversight. 6th floor rooms have balconies overlooking the pool deck, which is a a bit of a good looking party town on weekends. but shuts down at dusk so not noisy during sleep time. bed was fantastic, spa, excellent and a fantastic gym. well located but parking is ridicuously expensive. great spot for a stay in austin."
5,Upscale downtown hotel,"Exactly what you would expect from a trendy, upscale downtown hotel. Pleasant staff, comfortable beds, luxury appointments.The lounge areas off the lobby are very interesting and laid out as a series of living rooms or libraries.Our room was not large, but clean, comfortable and quiet. It did seem, though, in the bathroom that practicality was sacrificed for trendy decor. If you need counter space in the sink area, you won‚Äôt find it here. And be careful stepping out of the tub/shower if you‚Äôre of short stature.The location is next door to the ACL Live music venue, so it was the perfect location for attending a concert there if you‚Äôre from out of town."
5,Amazing stay,"W is maybe my favourite hotel in the world. This one in Austin is amazing in terms of style, design, service and quality of the stay. I would reconmend to try their √† l√† carte breakfast, it's absolutely amazing."
5,One of the standout W properties,"I am a big fan of the W, and this is a great one. The location is incredible, it has probably the best gym out of any property I've visited (I think it's better than the gym I actually pay for in San Francisco), and the service is TOP notch. I know what a good Starwood property is capable of and these guys bring it up a notch. Any request gets handled immediately. Eliza at the front desk really took care of my party -- and then sent us a hand written note recommending a breakfast spot. I can't wait to return!"
4,The luxury Hotel in Summer!,"The bed is incredibly comfortable, the decor looks fashionable and designed! There are many poor parties within W hotel in summertime and they do provide free tickets. As a SPG member, I highly recommend this brand hotel."
5,The W Hotel rarely disappoints and always finds ways to make me smile!,"I travel often for work and tend to always stay at SPG and Marriot properties. If possible, the W Hotel is always my favorite property due to the attention to detail and the excellent customer service. They are always accommodating to early check-in and late departures which are a big deal for someone like me who lives their life on the road. The rooms are simple and not grandiose and have a sophisticated feel to them. I love the restaurants and the location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic. I can get anywhere downtown quickly and there are many options for food all within a one block walking distance. The pool is absolutely amazing! This last visit I had a room that overlooked the pool and river which was very nice. You can rarely go wrong staying at the W Hotel, especially the beautiful one in Austin."
5,Fantastic hotel,"W as you would like to have a W hotel. Placed directly downtown, the hotel is wonderful. Big and modern rooms, awesome gym and a wonderful and relaxing pool area.The restaurant and hotel bar offer great food. Looking forward to my next stay at W Austin."
4,Ya always know what you'll get at a W,"Love W Hotels. I don't know what that ""W hotel smell"" is but I want my place to smell like the W. Room was fantastic. Service great. Concierge pointed me in the right direction. Super close to the river if ya fancy a run. And walking distance to all restaurant and night life. Pool was super nice. The W is always solid. You know what you get with a W and this hotel upholds the brand rep."
4,"Cool room, super nice hotel!","This was my first time at a W hotel, and it was pretty good. The rooms are super interesting, and did not feel like the same old standard room. It was nicely decorated and had a great view. The amenities and snacks in the room are also really nice.The hotel has a lovely pool, and a few events in the lobby while I was there.The only issue I had was that the hotel charges a deposit per night for damages in the room, which was over $100 for every night I was there, instead of one full deposit. I was staying for 2 weeks, and I had been traveling for work for a few weeks, so this caused me to have an issue with my card. The staff were not understanding at all, did not let me charge the deposit on another card, and the room on one card, and gave me no options so I was pretty stuck. This kind of ruined my stay at the hotel."
5,Great Hotel. Pool is first class!,"Went to the W for a weekend trip with friends. Spent a Saturday at the pool and cabanas. First class service, food was great, great looking guests and awesome music. Very diverse crowd with a great vibe. Door men and women were a nice touch at the front door and rooms were small but modern and sleek. We will be back."
5,Our Second Visit Sealed the Deal--The W is definitely the best in ATX,"This is the second time we've stayed at the W Austin, and we were thankful for a Starwood SPG upgrade to a gorgeous suite with sweeping views over Lady Bird Lake and the raging cauldron of hormones known as the WET Deck pool. The rooms are nearly perfect--giant bottles of Bliss products (guess what got stashed into my bag), rain forest showers with built-in-to-the-walls non-fogging mirror tiles at different levels (truly thoughtful for couples like us, where my husband is several inches shorter than I am), an over-size whirlpool bathtub with views over the city, a thoughtful selection of books to read while lounging on the massive sectional beneath the vast windows looking out in 3 different directions over Austin. My only complaint, which I often have, is the incredible difficulty of accessing an available electric outlet--I nearly killed myself crawling under the desk trying to find one. The hotel's location is perfect--just far enough away from the 6th Street madness but close enough to join it. On Saturdays, the amazing Austin Farmer's Market is just outside the door, and the paths of Lady Bird Lake are 2 blocks away. After an afternoon of cheap drinks/apps and a lot of fun (thanks to host Gilbert) at the afternoon happy hour in the Living Room Lounge, we decided to take advantage of the hotel's amazing location and walk to dinner at Otoko in the sizzlingly hot SoCo area, and we hardly broke a sweat. Unfortunately, the nightly parking rate is more expensive than spending the night at many hotels, and in Austin '17, there are virtually no cheap alternatives in the area. It's all worth it--this hotel is definitely the best that Austin has to offer."
5,Always a Good Time!,Great location. Wonderful Staff. Always a good scene and crowd. Rooms are lovely and a sweet oasis in a bustling neighborhood. Pool is fun and a lovely escape from most business part of downtown. Close enough to all of the best parts of Austin.
3,Anniversary weekend,"Very nice staff, great food, great lounging areas, great location, beds and pillows very comfortable, pool TOO small, loud and very crowded. Rooms overpriced, definitely a great hotel for ages 30 and under."
5,Stylish and comfortable,I stayed here for my business trip. The room is cozy and stylish. Room size is not big but has a large and comfortable bathroom.The hotel only has 1 restaurant but it is the perfect location to reach lots of fine restaurants & bars in the city.Their bar was really nice but I preferred to have a drink at an outdoor pool. Very beautiful place.
5,Shout out to the Sales Team!!,"I work for a tour company in Austin called Austin Detours. I just had the privilege of having 12 of the sales team from the W on a Street Art Tour, and they really made my day!! Teamwork makes the dream work, and these guys and gals are living the dream!! Thanks so much again! I hope we get to do more with your team!"
5,AWAY Spa Amazing experience,Symphony at the front desk absolutely went above and beyond to make my experience a perfect one. She was extremely friendly when checking in and very helpful when it came to finding my personal property I had forgotten in the men's locker room. She saved me from having to replace a $450 item only because she did whatever it took to find it. (including going through heaps of towels) I will definitely be going back and kudos to Symphony. She is an asset to the W away spa team that deserves to be recognized.
5,A nice hotel for conference,Joined a gathering last November to watch President Election Broadcasting with Technical community in Austin. Nice atmosphere in the meeting hall in the 2nd floor of the hotel. About 2-3 hundreds participants showed and the snack/drink is fantastic. It's in the center of Austin downtown with convenient public transportation and walking distance to Austin visitors' center.
4,Great location and staff,"This hotel is located right between 2nd and 3rd on LaVaca. You are in a perfect location although you need to walk a while to get to Congress, Rainey or 6th Street. Uber just got back into Austin, so you have plenty of options.The hotel is fine, but showing its age. Our shower didn't work and the temperature was either very hot or very cold. Some of the wood in the room was chipped and I saw a burn mark on the ceiling. The bed was great and we were located on a very high floor so the noise was not bad.The staff was terrific. We were all greeted when we arrived and the staff at the front door could not have been nicer. The Bar and pool are full of trendoids who would make anyone out of high school feel old. The exercise facility was great. One of the best I have ever seen in a hotel. The spa was nice too.While this hotel is certainly starting to show its age, it was a fine stay. I would certainly return again."
5,Favorite hotel in Austin!!,"My husband I stayed here in June 2016 to celebrate our anniversary and absolutely loved it! We knew it was going to be a great stay from the moment we checked in. Javier at the front desk was such a pleasure to deal with. My husband was an SPG gold member at the time and he upgraded us to an amazing room. We were also given a complimentary lunch at their restaurant Trace which we highly recommend. The room had the most incredible view of Lady Bird Lake, it was modern and the bed was very comfortable. The service at the hotel was fantastic from beginning to end and everyone went out of their to way to ensure our stay and anniversary were perfect. The location can't be beat as well, we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel and never needed our car. We look forward to planning a trip back this summer."
5,W Wow'd way beyond our wildest dreams,"We were celebrating. The W went overboard as they delighted with us and made certain our stay was memorable. Even beforehand, Donna (concierge) made contact with me and answered several questions. With our SPG membership, we gained early access to our room - a beautiful suite that took our breath away, almost to the point of tears. HOW AMAZING. The Sunday brunch at The Trace was delicious (with $5 for little pitcher of mimosas) and our waitress, Stephanie, was exceptional to the point we asked for her by name on Monday. At the pool, we were treated like royalty. During the entire overnight stay, it was as if The W enjoyed having US stay.For us, the quiet pool on Monday was MUCH more enjoyable than on Sunday, when a boisterous party with loud music takes place.We returned 4 weeks later for Sunday brunch at The Trace."
5,We Love This Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights for a ""staycation"". It is in a great location, close to everything and love the fact that it is connected to the Moody Theater. We had a large corner room, which had great amenities, including a steamer, which was awesome! The room has a little bit of a funky decor, but nicely appointed. We ate at Trace, which is the hotels restaurant and the food was excellent. They have a great gym and we got massages in the Spa and I really liked it, very relaxing. Overall it was a great stay, even though we weren't that far away from home, we got a taste of the downtown life and loved it!"
4,"Nice hotel ,more for tourists","Great staff and good location downtown. The gym is very good with lots of various machines. No excuses no to use it during your visitThe hotel is not really suited for the business traveler , but I enjoyed my stay."
4,One of the better W locations,"I had a very quick trip into Austin (less than 24hrs) and stayed at the W in Austin for the first time. Not sure how I haven't stayed in this W before as I come to Austin somewhat regularly - assume price has been an issue in the past. But, apparently not this time. Got a decent rate on my one night there.Good location in the downtown area. The front desk folks were warm and efficient. The rooms are fine - a bit conservative decor-wise compared to other W properties.Spotlessly clean and the bed was comfortable. Thought the bathroom layout was well done with a large full-size mirror and spacious shower.Would stay again."
4,"Win! Great Vibe, Fun Bar scene, very nice rooms, good gym.",Location downtown is good - near the restos and bars etc. The hotel has a friendly atmosphere and I thought the value was good if you shop carefully - look for specials and deals on the hotel website.
3,Struggling to keep up in a hot market,"There is nothing terribly wrong with the W, but there is nothing exceptional. Austin's downtown has numerous excellent hotels in this price range. The W seems to be struggling to remain relevant. The service is excellent as always. The pool area is great with plenty of seating. The lobby is dark and small and not inviting. So many Austin hotels are open and mirror the pedestrian nature of Austin's downtown.The room was average and the bed and linens awful. Our bed had a pad between the mattress and sheets that you would use to keep a child from wetting the bed. It felt like sleeping on gym mats. The sheets were always slick or greasy feeling. Tough to enjoy a hotel when your night's sleep suffers. No tub in our room, no refrigerator beyond the honor bar. The W considers their staff as ""talent"", which seems a little silly.In many other cities, this hotel would be a hip choice. In Austin, the W is barely relevant."
5,Austin Stay-Cation for wife's Bday,"There is rarely any surprise with the W hotel. Generally new, centrally located, cool, and pricey.The location in Austin is ideal. It's close to ACL, to the town lake, and to all of the best restaurants and nightlife.Concierge went out of their way to help make my wife's bday extra special and upgraded the room for us to a corner suite. D√©cor throughout the hotel was modern, hip, and fun.The hotel bar/club was a definite hot spot; it was packed and loud"
5,"Great service, atmosphere and quality","The W Austin really stood out to me this weekend (and it was a Holiday weekend). I booked through the Amex Fine Hotel Program and was luckily upgraded to a corner suite upon arrival. The service was awesome all around from check in, to the servers by the pool (and I have high standards). The pool area had a very fun vibe. Room Service food was average, but that's about it. I left something in my room after checking out, which was found and shipped back to me. I'll be back!"
5,"Exactly what you would expect from this brand - class, elegance and quality.","The W brand is synonymous with excellence and this property does not disappoint. From the moment you check in, this modern hotel has so many great amenities. Service is second to none and even the smallest detail is not overlooked.The room had great quality and a cool urban feel. The location is central to a lot in Downtown Austin especially the concert venue next door.Highly recommend but of course it isn't cheap. Would recommend looking at the package rates that include parking which end up being a better deal."
5,We will be back!,"hotel was fun and hip and the place to be on the weekend in downtown. DJ Diggy Dutch was DJing on Friday night for happy hour and he was awesome. Food in the lounge was spectacular. Our room was clean too; my only complaint was that the shower pressure was low. The staff was superb and helped in every way possible during our stay. Can't recommend this hotel enough, will definitely be back!"
5,Above and beyond,"The amazing service the W is known for actually started before our stay. Kayla reached out because I forgot to add my SPG number to my reservation. I shared how excited my husband and I were to be celebrating our 24th anniversary there and she was sweet to congratulate us and ask if there was anything she could do to make our stay better. Boy did she make it better! We arrived to a beautiful room with a view of the lake and were pleasantly surprised to receive a bottle of Prosecco, chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely handwritten note - from Kayla! She really made our stay so special and perfect in every way. We visit Austin often and the W will definitely be our new go-to. Still smiling."
5,Great Austin location for weekend getaway!,"Love the W Austin for multiple reasons! Great location and the staff have the Austin vibe! Welcomed at check-in with a glass of champagne, a special touch! A highlight is the AWAY Spa, they do an awesome facial and this trip did not disappoint! Lively pool scene and wonderful fitness center. To top it off, we had a fabulous view of Lady Bird Lake. Love the bedding, especially the pillows!!!! Where can we get these?"
4,Great Location,"Stayed for a few days with the family. Nice hotel, though certainly more swank than family oriented. Staff are very nice and helpful. The pool is a bit of a scene, so definitely not family oriented or family friendly, really. And the concrete that the pool grounds is paved with- very poor choice for a pool deck in Austin: it is scorching hot & basically unwalkable without some form of shoe on. They should not have picked the type of concrete/stone they used. The hotel restaurant was great for breakfast and the staff were very friendly.*Of note- there is no door to the bathroom and the shower stall is glass. Definitely set up for young couples with no kids."
5,Relaxing,My wife and I were in Austin for a few days and wanted some luxury. This place has it all. The food at Trace is really good. The atmosphere is very hip. The gym is great along with the pool area. The shopping and restaurants in the area are great too.
5,Fantastic!,"I loved the W hotel. It's very upscale and hip. The service at the front desk was great - welcoming, polite, eager to help. The room was spotless. I had a corner one bedroom suite and it came very equipped. I loved that they had a nespresso machine in the room. They had some great lounge space that appeared to be popular with the 20 something local crowd.It's a gorgeous hotel and I really hope to be back."
5,Great style and facilities at this Austin Downtown location,"In January, I stayed at the Austin W for the 10th time on business. I know this because I received a 10th visit gift from the management. I love the style in this hotel with the waterfall showers, over sized tubs, and sofas in the suites. I have been upgraded for free quite often with my platinum spg status. I also love the spacious, well equipped gym. There is a pretty happening club attached to the hotel, but I've never been. It seems to be popular with the young, hip, single crowd. The downtown location is great, because there are a ton of great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops right near by. If you are coming to downtown Austin for business or fun the W is a great pick alone or with adult friends. I would not choose this hotel with young children."
5,Obsessed,I am so obsessed with this hotel. We had an amazing welcome everyone was very friendly. We were upgraded to a suite after telling the concierge we were here for our anniversary. He also offered us a late checkout so we would have more pool time the next day. Our room is so nice! They are all about the details. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Austin!!!
5,70th birthday celebration,"I was visiting relatives in Austin to celebrate my 70th birthday on May 20th. My 33 year old niece suggested we go to the W for drinks and music to finish celebrating. The bar is very hip, music by DJ was great and the place was really lively starting at about 9:00. Gilbert, the manager in the bar, was fantastic! He walked by, to check on us and to see if we needed anything. I told him it was my 70th birthday and he immediately brought me a piece of chocolate cake with a Happy Birthday spelled out in chocolate around the plate! What a great manager!! I just want to thank Gilbert for making my night!! I was there with my sister, and niece. The drinks were wonderful, music was great and Gilbert was the Best!! He helped make my 70th birthday special! Again, many thanks Gilbert! What a true professional!! We will be back to ""party"" at the W on my next trip to Austin!! Cathy Harris/Realtor--Boerne,Texas"
3,W hotel. Excellent concierge staff but a disruptive party scene,"We planned to go to Austin to celebrate a 50th birthday. The concierge was wonderful about booking reservations, etc.We agonized over whether or not to spend an extra $1000 (for two rooms) for the pool scene or stay at the driskill. We thought we would splurge and have the opportunity to sit by the pool and relax.The hotel was a drunken fraternity party - bumper to bumper filled with people who were trashed. It was horribly unpleasant. When we complained about it we were told that the hotel would make arrangements for us to go to the four seasons pool the next day (neer heard from them).Upon check out we were told that since we booked via a third party they could just credit our account 2500 miles (insulting) and then the manager said he would give us 10,000 credits. This is not even one night's stay.Here is what the manager told me: ....we are known for a party atmosphere in our Wet deck, especially during the summer months. W Hotels are known for this type of atmosphere, and I am sorry that this is not what you were looking for during your recent visit to Austin.Really, rooms over $550 a night and its a drunken brawl? And that is what the W is known for?Additionally, there is limited drawer space in the rooms. We were told that bureaus were taken out due to a fire hazard."
3,A party hotel close enough to the Convention Center to be business,"Easy, friendly hotel close to business and play time.Employees are very accommodating and awesome in the 'can do attitude' the W is known for. Although I requested extra towels upon check in and 2 more times and never received.Modern and clean lined room missed the actual mark on clean with dusty surfaces, hair and spills left behind but head of housekeeping personally addressed. Comfortable bed and bedding - beware of noisy neighbors if you are sensitive (I could clearly hear the conversations of my rowdy neighbors and their tv/radio.)The valets are true professionals and help arrival/departure and taxi hailing. No Uber in Austin so download the RideAustin app (it's their version) and works great.The W bars downstairs are busy but if there aren't your style, its a quick walk to popular areas of 6th or Rainey."
5,W funky upscale fun,"Location is great, service was excellent and exuberant. The rooms are really nice, although they lack a door between the room and the glass shower so if you are shy with your roommate, that might be an issue. The bar is fun, the workout room(s) are the best I've ever seen. Close to just about everything - you could easily stay here and skip renting a car."
5,"Sleek, contemporary, hip hotel","When you first enter the W lobby, you're not sure you're in the right place...cement floors with exposed grey columns, a few people sitting on modular chairs, a young woman sitting in front of a laptop at a large shared table smiling at you (who turned out to be the concierge) and a few steps further in, three pedestals for check-in, in a dimly lit transition room. This is not the grandiose lobby you may be used to, but instead a very eclectic, interesting entrance to a comfortable and vibrant hotel! The rooms have a contemporary design, are spacious, well lit, and include built-in bedside power cords for most smart phones. The bathrooms are open with a large separate shower, oversize sink and enclosed toilet. Rooms included all the amenities you're used to having and were very quiet. The hotel had an indoor/outdoor restaurant, multiple bar/lounge areas and a hidden Red bar (lots of rooms to explore), along with a top notch workout facility, with a constant flow of young vibrant locals throughout the afternoons and evenings!"
4,Party vib,"This hotel definitely has a younger, party feel. Music was usually playing in the commons areas when we were there. It wasn't 'blasting,' but definitely louder than background music. I like the atmosphere, however, it's not a quite refined feel, but anyone who knows the W hotels probably knows what to expect. The common areas are modern, well furnished, and lots of places to get a drink, and hang out. The pool bar was hopping, as was the pool. We had a drink in the pool area and it was good. We didn't try the restaurant. We had a corner suite which included a living area and separate bedroom. Very comfortable, nicely furnished, big shower (although no privacy). Overall this is a very cool hotel, upscale, upbeat, modern. If that's not your thing stay elsewhere. We were on the 15th floor and we could here music thumping into the early morning hours. Wasn't a deal breaker for us, but for some it might be."
5,Cool Vib,We are SPG members and as a reward for our 50th stay at one of their hotels we got a free upgrade. We had a lovely corner balcony suite. This gym is state of the art. The lobby has several nooks and crannies to cozy up in. One room features a very large sports screen. Another plush couches and chairs with a wall of old musicalbum covers. Several bars as well. Best of all our Maltese felt right at home. Great service too.
5,Exceptional Service & a squat rack,"I'm normally not a ""W Guy"" but my wife sold me on staying here for a few days before our wedding in April. I'm glad she did.The concierge Jesse (sp?) was incredibly helpful on several occasions. She helped me order flowers for the room and find a last-minute cleaners to steam the wedding dress and my suit.The front desk, bell-hops and valets all provided similarly great, if less noticed, service.I also would give the pool and gym high marks. The pool food was tasty, if pricey, and the small deck gets good sun most of the day.The gym is perhaps the biggest hotel gym I've use and includes the holy grail for traveling fitness buffs: a squat rack!"
5,wedding weekend,"We held my daughter's wedding at the W and they did a fantastic job. They were helpful, accommodating and kind. We had events there Friday, Saturday and Sunday and used many different venues in the hotel. The weekend was wonderful and the food was excellent!"
4,LOCATION IS AMAZING!,"We absolutely loved how pet friendly it was here. Doggie packs at the door with a toy/treats/chews. And although there were some service hiccups, the manager, Fabian, took care of everything with absolute grace! Highly recommend! If you drive a Tesla, be sure to request charging from valet when they park."
5,Welcoming Hotel,This Hotel has a great location in Austin. Close (walking distance) to many of the places we wanted to visit.The Staff is very welcoming and will do all they can to make your stay comfortable.The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Great beds too! We had a wonderful stay.
5,One of my favs in Austin,"We live just outside of the city but far enough away to justify an overnight getaway every now and then. The W is my favorite. It's chic and elegant. Rooms are plush, stylish, and comfy. Service is impeccable.We didn't visit the pool the last time but it was lovely the first time. The bar is pricy but worth it."
5,W Austin review,"Very good location, rooms are well arranged and the lounge has some of the best people watching in town. There are several rooms inside the same lounge, one has a tv for sports, one has a DJ etc, the best part of the place.The pool is small but it gets decent amount of sun and service was pretty good."
5,Very perfect,"Quiet rooms, heard zero noise. Good beds, shower and bathroom first rate. Awesome work out facility.Was there for a conference and appreciated the food which was imaginative and had healthy options. Staff welcoming Entire experience was topshelf all the way ."
5,"Holy crap, swank fest!!!","stayed at the W for a work event recently, it blew my mind. The decor was really on point, i was impressed. Pro's: location ,location, location, views, rooftop patio area, pool area, rooms itself, service. Cons: the food was just OK at our catered events, nothing to write home about, some areas were so dark i could barely see. People were legit showing up in Ferrari's to drink at the hotel bar, it was kinda crazy. it was very hipster as other reviewers have eluded to, but all of Austin is so why would this be any different. Very first class overall all around, i would recommend!!"
5,"Great rooms, superb location in downtown Austin !","I loved the design of the rooms at this hotel, a very spacious bathroom and oversized shower were located behind the bedroom and my room had a nice view of Town Lake. Cool Lounge areas in this property as well.""W"" properties tend to be a little ""hipster"" - but generally fun for folks under 55 !Staff was very helpful at all times. Warning: Overnight Parking is $ 39/night extra."
2,BDAY in DT Austin,"I'll list the positives first: great location in down town Austin, Saturday night had a DJ and a fun club/lounge vibe.Negatives: asked for early check in and late check out so we could enjoy the pool/gym/spa before flying home - which was declined because they were fully booked. Typically even fully booked W's can do this for SPG or Amex members but they could not. Food at Trace restaurant was terrible which was surprising because Austin is so foodie. Bar/Pool service is only done through a phone by the pool where you call the room service Dept and they bring you a drink out to the pool which means you are charged all kinds of room service fees. Two skinny margarita's were $40. If you are looking for vacation service and good food this is not be the best W for that - seemed to cater to more of the business client vs. people wanting to have a getaway. Our room was over $350, valet parking and two margaritas for $500. Wasn't really worth it. A sharp disappointing contrast to the W Hotel Scottsdale, AZ which is my go-to get away spot."
5,Good hotel in a great location,"I stayed here with my twin for four nights and five days. Not only did I find the hotel staff to be courteous and helpful, but they really had a mastery of the local area and proved to be a good resource in finding hidden gem restaurants. The room was nice and the view beautiful leaving nothing to complain about. The location cannot be beat as it is walking distance to 6th street as well as the capitol. While I wasn't overwhelmed by the pool, the fitness area in the morning and the bar in the lobby at night can't be missed. Overall, while this isn't a cheap stay, I don't mind paying for quality and this was a quality stay worth the price."
4,Modern hotel adjacent to ACL's Moody Theater,"If you are a music fan and a pet lover - this is the Austin venue for you! Austin City Limits' Moody Theater is adjacent to this pet-friendly W Austin Hotel. The concierge can assist with obtains tickets to the frequent music shows.The decor is modern, coffee makers just added to each guest room.Ask for a south facing room for Colorado River or Lady Bird Lake Hike & Bike trail view, or north facing for the city view.The AWAY SPA is fabulous!Each hotel bar has a different ambiance, so roam around until you find one whose atmosphere you like.Trace restaurant has excellent fish, soups, brunch, and be sure to order the truffle popcorn as an appetizer."
5,Wonderful Friday at the W Hotel!,"Got to Austin on a beautiful Friday afternoon and went straight to the pool. Very urban and nice! The location of the hotel is a big plus just two blocks from Town Lake, at the Austin City Limits and close to all the downtown restaurants. Nice, modern but quiet hotel. Valet parking is expensive but goes with the experience. A repeat for us!"
5,Great hotel in downtown Austin,"I stayed at the W hotel in Austin for one night. The staff was helpful and professional. The room was nicely appointed with a clean, fresh look. The bathroom was well layer out and clean. Room service was prompt and the food was very good. There are several bars in the hotel, each one with a different vibe. I would definitely stay there again."
5,Outstanding Hotel and Location,"The staff was professional and helpful, the location was great, rooms very nice and large, (we had a corner suite). You can walk to many restaurants and boutique shops. We stumbled upon the new yeti headquarters/store, fabulous. Would definitely stay there again!! Loved Austin!"
5,beautiful,"very nice, downstairs was so pretty. we had very friendly service each day we were there. the room was nice as well. the mirror in the bathroom was back lit. it also had plenty of sitting room. a chaise lounge, 2 chairs and an ottoman."
5,Memorable stay! Loved it in there! :) Will be coming back.,"The room was very nice, clean and a good size, also beautifuk decor. The hotel is in the middle of Downtown, right near Willie Nelson statue and ACL live at the moody theater. On the 2nd street, which is the cleanest and nicest street between all the state capitol cities we've ever seen. The air is clean, nice lights on all the trees throughout the street, restaurants, cafes, people walking days and evenings and enjoying an ambience, WE felt very secure and relaxed there.We walked to the Congress Ave Bridge (7 minutes of walk frim the hotel) and watched famous Austin bats (couple millions of them flying in one direction from under the bridge) on sunset. Magestic scene!We also made a trip to San Antonio (1h 15 min of drive), it was a wonderful day: visiting Alamo, going along Riverwalk, having lunch at one of the Riverwalk restaurants. And we drove from San Antonio to 3 other Missions. Corgeous Missions!! Mission Conception, Mission San Jose, Mission San Juan Capistrano. So many wonderful impressions!!!On the 3rd day we walked from the hotel to the Capitol Building. Beautiful building with a very big park and interesting historical monuments.Coming back to the hotel we felt relaxed and rested. Yes!: The restaurant in the hotel - Trace, was great as well! We had breakfasts in there every day (that kind of breakfast which equals breakfast + lunch :) Very tasty and BIG). And we had one of our dinners at the Trace as well. Very tasty :)Had an amazing stay at W Austin! Definitely the hotel to stay in the heart of Austin and make some remarkable short trips!#1 on our list for Austin :)"
4,It's fine.,"Our room was fine, our service was fine, but nothing was truly exceptional. This is a fine place to stay. It seems like it's trying a little too hard to be cool and hip. I will say we had an excellent trip as we truly fell in love with the city of Austin."
3,Did not live up to our expectations.,"While the W was not the closest hotel to our show, we stayed there because of their Pets Are Welcome Program. The entire staff was very nice and accommodating, but the hotel was not a good value for the price and the web site amenities that were supposed to be provided for pets AT CHECK-IN (Pet toy, W Hotels pet tag, Clean-up bags) and IN-ROOM (Custom W pet bed, Food & water bowl with floor mat, Special treat at turn down) were not provided. We were asked if our room had a bark box (it did not) and then were told they didn't have any. We didn't bring food and water bowls, bedding, bags, etc for our pets and found ourselves in quite the predicament. As travelers, we thought it was awesome to be able to pack less things because the hotel provided so much, finding out that a policy letter and a door tag were the only pet amenities was very disappointing."
5,Super Bowl Headquarters,"Faced with the prospect of staying in a second rate motel in a sold-out Houston during the Super Bowl, we opted for a 2 1/2 hour drive to the game and chose to stay at the W Hotel in Austin.The W location is close to many of the best restaurants and live music venues of dAustin. We had dinner at the W's in-house restaurant Trace and were delighted at the progressive and healthy menu (my wife does not do barbecue). We walked to Antone's to catch Micky and the Motorcars 9 PM show. Upon return to the hotel, the numerous lounge offerings provided respite for the sports fans and beautiful people alike. They accommodate such groups with ease, as the venues are discretely separated from the hotel lobby .Our room had a great view of the Colorado River. The construction of the building is both massive and elegant, creating soundproof rooms that are beautifully designed and appointed. The bed could be one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Valet parking was efficient, the staff was helpful and friendly. We went shopping at some of the unique nearby shops the next morning. We loved the truffle popcorn at the bar. Awesome weekend, awesome hotel."
5,Quality Hotel,Usually stay at Westins and wanted to change it up. Staff was very nice. Room was spacious but.....We stayed in a room with deck and of course was charged extra. Its was disappointing as there wasn't any privacy and if your neighbors are out on their deck smoking you look right at them. It also looked out at parking garages. You could see the pool if you stood up and looked over railing.
5,Never disappoints. Service. Location. Energy. Did I mention SERVICE,"Recently completed my 10th stay here in the last 12 months(since I was spg) and it was about to start out RUFF (pun intended).I brought the same dog as I always do and in the past no one has ever mentioned extra fees until now...late on a Saturday after a 3 hour drive with a pre paid room...Well Benjamin wasn't budging on the $125 cleaning fee but he did REALLY REALLY take care of my Spg Gold upgrade. He is the man and really turned lemons into lemonade.Love the room and the views and the vibe and the bathroom products (may have taken the leftovers home!)Don't stay anywhere else, I won't!"
5,Exceptional,"If our trip wasn't already made by the beautiful hotel and atmosphere (and complimentary champagne at check in) it was brought to an all time high by the staff! It was my dad's 70th birthday and my entire family was blown away by the extra effort and enthusiasm from Tim, Benjamin, and channe! Only complaint is that our stay wasn't longer!"
5,Excellent,"Reasonable rate, comfortable beds, artisanal couch, lots of tempting snacks & waters. Valet parking, and public lots both available.My only complaint is there is no door for the shower. I travel with 4 to 8 other men 7 months of the year. There's nothing wrong with a little homoeroticism here & there but let a man was his cash and prizes in private!Desk staff was cool. Even offered to let me use their hairspray.This hotel isn't for cheap people."
5,Amazing staff and location! Very dog friendly...would stay here again and again!,"I travel a ton for work and frequently stay at W properties nationwide. They are all great, but The Austin W is, hands-down, one of my favorite properties! It stands out for so many reasons, but the team at the W Austin is what knocks this particular one out of the park!!I will run out of space naming all of the staff who made my extended stay there so enjoyable! So let me start by telling you why you want to stay here...1. Need it, they got it or will go out of their way to make it happen! They really do ""Whatever Whenever"" they can to meet each and every need. And my particular situation was a little more challenging given that my dog and I had to stay here abruptly due to some repairs at my place.2. Location: I'm a native Austinite and I can tell you that this is one of the top downtown locations! The 2nd street district has so much to offer - walk to a ton of shops, restaurants, lady bird lake, etc.3. Dog-Friendly: If you have to travel with your furry friend, this is the most dog-friendly hotel I've ever stayed at. From complimentary doggie ice cream to dog care packages and walking services, my dog had it gooooood, real good!And now to the staff who make this all happen!Whatever Whenever:Channe, Marian, Mary Carmen and Donna were amazing! The three who had to ""deal with me""/meet my needs the most were Channe, Marian and Mary Carmen. But I'm grateful for all that this team did to make my stay so comfortable.Then there are the ambassadors. All so great! Tim and Alex were the two I got to know most. Alex is a dog lover and went out of his way to get to know my 15-year-old Weimar during our stay! And, Tim...oh...Tim. If you run into Tim, you'll know it. He's the one who will tell you anything and everything you need to know about the hotel amenities and put a smile on your face after a long day at work! Well, frankly they all do!And the restaurant and lounge staff are absolutely impeccable and unforgettable! Andre, Tiffany, Chandella, Jenna, Casey, David, Jesse, Bobby, Sir. Chris Booker, Will and so many others! Special thanks to Andre, Tiffany, Chandella, Jenna and Casey for always making me and my dog feel so welcome and comfortable.And, behind the scenes, the staff did so much. I had to stay at the hotel due to some unfortunate damage to my condo and Jan Shaw on the revenue team and Daniel in the GM office were so flexible in accommodating my extended stay.If you get a chance to come to Austin - do it! It's my hometown, so I'm biased...but it is truly an amazing city and this is a perfect hotel team to compliment this great town!"
5,New Years Eve,"I had a problem, but Danielle Carrier went above and beyond to help me. She provided great customer service, responding quickly and professionally. I will definitely come back and visit!Thank you, Danielle, for all your help!!"
5,fantastic hotel,a really cool hotel in a really cool city. The hotel and rooms are very stylish with great attention to detail. The gym is one of the best equipped gyms I have ever seen in a hotel. I will definately stay here again on my next visit to Austin
4,Fan of Willie Nelson - see his satue in the courtyard,Great cosmopolitan hotel - nice lobby areas for food and drinks - the record library room was a nice casual place for a drink.Had the fortune of being there when they unveiled the Willie statue -- lots of celebs etc.
5,Amazing experience!,"All of the staff treated us like royalty and went above and beyond for us. I loved everything about this hotel, including the Bliss toiletry products! We stayed here for the New Years Eve party which was awesome!!! View was amazing! Definitely will be attending the party next year. Thank you W Austin!"
5,What An Excellent Getaway,"Upon arrival I was greeted by Esteban and Tyler, who were extremely courteous and professional. They offered help with my bags to my room and then explained where check in was. Caleb was phenomenal. Being in town for only the night and telling him that I rarely get away he offered to upgrade me to a larger and view friendly room. The room was AMAZING. Comfortable, chic, and absolutely inviting. I really wish I lived here. I definitely recommend staying here and will be back."
5,Excellent Stay!,"Stayed Thursday evening and it was great!! All of the staff was very nice, especially Austin at the front desk and the girl in valet! Dante at the bar was very friendly and welcoming as well. My room was awesome and had a great view of the city and the bed/pillows were very comfortable. The hotel is in a perfect location in the 2nd Street District just a quick walk to shopping, restaurants, and nightlife. I love how they decorated the elevators for Christmas!"
2,So much for Southern Hospitality,"We came to Austin as part of a Texas road trip and saw great reviews online. We arrived at the hotel and my mother went inside to check-in while I stayed in the car. All of a sudden, the door opened, a man got in and said ""Where are the keys?"" I was absolutely startled. He didn't introduce himself and did not say if he was from the hotel or anything (it was raining and cold so he was bundled up. I didnt see any name tag or labels on his clothes with the hotel on it) I told him that my mom had the keys in a panic. Thankfully, my mother came out to the strange scene and confronted him which he asked her if we were self-parking or using the valet service and he took the keys which is when we figured out he was part of the valet service. He still didn't introduce himself. At that point, our luggage was removed from the car and we were rushed upstairs to our room. Needless to say, the trip didn't start off well. Thankfully, our trip around Austin redeemed this incident and we were satisfied with our trip."
4,"Good service, great views","The river view is awesome, if you can manage it.This W lacks some of the design flourishes found in others around the world but has most of the touches which make Ws standout hotels.Bed less comfortable than normal? Built in apple cords next to bed a plus.Great convenient downtown location, minutes to a South Congress.Though there is a thriving club in the building the sound does not carry- no worries there."
5,Worth the $$$$,Each time I have stayed at the W in Austin the staff has been unbelievably nice. The hotel has arguably the best location in Austin. The bar is first rate. If you're looking for a foolproof great place to stay this is the place
5,Very nice stay,It is a premium quality hotel at moderate prices. Door service and valet were very friendly. Front desk and concierge were helpful. Rooms were nice although teh bathroom layout NO DOOR was quite odd. Needed to order a shower curtain to put in front of the glass shower for privacy. Great lobby and lounge which doubles as a club at night. On site dining was great for brunch. Would definitely go back. In the center of it all with almost everything downtown walkable.
3,Just Ok,"I was excited to be at this hotel for an overnight business meeting. I've stayed at the Dallas W and was expecting a similar high end vibe but was disappointed. The staff was attentive, but the hotel itself felt like a low to moderately priced residential loft building. Contemporary but worn and tired. My room was tiny with a low bed, thin mattress, I checked to see if it was a roll away. I've never seen a half size tub/shower, until then. Wish I had thought to take photos. Nice workout facility, that's pretty much the highlight. Wouldn't stay again if I had to pay for it."
5,Beautiful Hotel in Vibrant Location :),"This hotel is gorgeous--clean and comfortable and located in a great part of town. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance, and the Austin City Limits concert venue is actually attached to the building. My room and bathroom were spacious and on the sixth floor I had a veranda overlooking the beautiful roof-top pool (in the summer months, they operate a hotel on that floor). The gym was amazing--definitely a step above the typical hotel gym :)."
5,Impressive hotel,"This was the first hotel I stayed in at Austin. It is rare to find a hotel with high ranking in every area. The service is spectacular. The food is delicious, the rooms are extremely clean and the gym is awesome! The location is perfect and the fireplace area is great for relaxing and having a glass of wine. I highly recommend this hotel."
4,"Great location, fun bar, rooms tired","During F1 week, it is a quite busy here, so the bars and restaurants are busy and have a great energy. Staff at the W are welcoming and try to assist at every move. Rooms are odd shapes, and our room must have the smallest king size bed in the USA. This is Texas too... so no idea how anyone of stature could sleep two in the tiny bed. Also a number of technical problems were encountered in the room. All fixed by the staff, but you can see, the hotel is starting to tire. There is also limited storage space to hang your clothes. Location is ideal for all of the bars and restaurants, and there is an efficient valet parking. Not sure we would stay again, as there are a number of newer hotels nearby , and some others in construction, and the bed really was too small for two. Bar area though, is a lively place to be on the weekend."
4,Very cool and hip hotel in a great location in Downtown Austin,"The rooms at all the W Hotels I've ever stayed in tend to be very nicely furnished but they never have enough room for clothing. No dresser to be found although there was a small closet. The bathroom was very nice and they have wonderful amenities by Bliss Spa. The restaurant, Trace was very nice and the wait staff was superb. There was a long wait at check-in, but it just seemed like we got there at a bad time, because I never saw a line at any other time. Water was always available whenever needed. The location was great as it was right in the heart of the downtown area. The only issue I had was that although we were on the 15th floor, there was considerable noise that we could hear when trying to sleep. The gym was well equipped. Didn't make use of the spa but it seemed like there were lots of treatments to choose from. Would definitely return to this hotel if we go back to Austin."
5,Luxury Hotel,"While this hotel is expensive, if you want a great location in downtown Austin with a beautiful hotel you should choose this place. The pool is great, the bar is fun, and the rooms were very nice. I went for business and loved staying at the W."
3,great location but service not so good.,"Location is very convenient to exploring Austin, however some issues... valet blocked our car as we were trying to leave and although he saw us sitting there trying to exit, he pulled someone elses car up and they took their sweet time leaving. Since he got a good tip from the entitled old msn, he just shrugged at us, like oh well.room was clean but small. When we got back one afternoon, our keys didn't work and we had to get new ones. No apology for any inconvenience. The words at the concierge ""whatever"" seems to be the attitude here.We also found a packet of narcotics on the closet shelf, gave it to a security guy in the lobby who said thanks and walked away. Again no big deal, no questions asked."
5,"Great 2-night stay, up to W standards","I was in Austin for a conference being held at the hotel itself and had a wonderful stay. Check in was efficient and friendly. My room was quite large with two queen beds and a nice view of the river, a large bathroom area, some snacks for a fee (though no mini-fridge/mini-bar), Apple + micro USB charging cables, bathrobes, iron + ironing board, a little sofa and a nice big desk. I am not sure what kind of room it was since that was taken care of by the vendor sponsoring the conference. It is also within walking distance of a number of restaurants, coffeehouses, bars, etc. including the well-known 6th St. and Rainey St. The bathroom area is not completely separate from the room, but you can request a privacy curtain to provide that separation; there's a funny little sign that says ""Close, but not that close?"" informing guests about this. There are 3 tiers of WiFi - one free, and two paid, the highest of which provides sufficient bandwidth for streaming and other high-traffic uses.The meeting rooms are nice and the gym is especially well-equipped with plenty of ellipticals, free weights, machines and a heavy bag. I believe that is due in part of the property is residences.In summary, very glad that I was able to spend my first time in Austin staying at the W."
5,Great hotel!,"We had a great experience at this hotel! It was pretty, clean, convenient to everything. My husband left his glasses there, 3 weeks later we called and they still had them. They got them back to him in 3 days! Very nice staff. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
4,Consistently great property slightly let down by front desk,"We spent two nights at the W - coincidentally during the ACL festival, as a result the hotel was pretty much at full capacity and a little pricier than normal.The lobby area is dark and stylish as per other W hotels. Our room was large and clean and over looked the lake with great sunrise views. Bathroom was large and well equips with lovely bliss products. It was well maintained throughout and proactively stocked with fresh toiletries and water daily.The pool is long and thin (and chilly!) and great for swimming laps or just relaxing with a drink in. I imagine if all cabanas were in use them the area would be very crowded but this was not the case in the 2 occasions I used the facilities. Pool bar was good with attentive service and nice (but not amazing) cocktails.Breakfast was served in the restaurant and on a front pavement area and was a good selection, served fresh and hot by attentive servers.My only real criticism was a slightly ad hoc front desk service - e.g we were checked in and welcomed in a warm friendly manner and offered advice or recommendations should we need them as well as received free water bottles in arriving back at the hotel both evenings which was great. However when we did ask for advice on food one night the member of staff was really unhelpful and offered no recommendation or map etc. On checkout we waited nearly ten minutes to be served even though there were 2 members of staff chatting to each other at the desk. A simple question about our bill could not be answered and we had to wait for someone else to help.I recognise these are only 2 small niggles in an otherwise brilliant stay but they did somewhat impact a view of otherwise consistently high service,"
5,Excellent location and near all of my favorite night spots!,"Stayed here for a birthday weekend with my spouse and friends. This hotel has everything you need for a fun time: location near the hot night spots, excellent restaurants within walking distance and excellent hotel staff to assist with every need. As an SPG Gold Member, I expected this location to be fabulous an it exceeded my level of expectations.The Wet Deck is great with pool side service and an excellent environment to celebrate with new and old friends.Our room was upgraded to a corner room with an excellent view of the river. I totally recommend getting a corner view as I would think all are great."
3,‚ÄúCozy room‚Äù = Extremely small room for a high price,"I stayed at the W for two nights while in town for vacation. In summary:Pros ‚Äì Central location, modern, clean, easy valet parking, good on-site amenities (restaurants, bars, spa, pool), good food, mostly friendly staff (refer to the concierge point below), Wi-Fi worked well, quite guest areasCons ‚Äì The ‚Äúcozy room‚Äù is almost too small for two people and you definitely overpay for what you get (think Tokyo/NYC-sized rooms or smaller) ‚Äì My rate was in excess of $500 per night, open plan rooms (no door to the bathroom, except for the toilet), the shower/tub has a very high clearance (it would be difficult for someone with mobility restrictions), the concierge was average to poor (delayed responses via e-mail prior to check-in, unenthusiastic staff when talking to them in-person)I have stayed at a few Ws (Taipei, Mexico City, Chicago, Hoboken) and some of them can be too loud and have a ‚Äúclub like‚Äù atmosphere ‚Äì the type of place you would visit but not stay. The Austin location, however, did a good job a separating the hotel from the party.I really want to give this hotel a ‚Äúvery good‚Äù rating (it has so much going for it); however, the room size and associated price drives it down to ‚Äúaverage‚Äù. This is why, despite the cons, I would stay at the W again if I could get a larger room at a better rate."
4,Hip hotel in good location downtown,"We opted for a Cool Corner Suite (their words) which ticked all the boxes for views and space. The bathroom has stunning views from the bath and shower which we much enjoyed while bathing. The colour scheme of red and grey was not quite to my taste as a bit masculine and heavy but the lighting and amenities are very well thought out and the beds very comfy.Smiley staff at the entrance and on the desk gave a warm welcome and touches like handing out bottles of water and fruit to take are appreciated. The rooftop pool area is an oasis with loads of loungers and cosy areas to sit with bar service all day. Take your earplugs if you want to zone out from the electronic Ibiza style music.All in all a good experience with the downside that the W is a very expensive place to rest your head. One black mark though, without realising it they charged all four nights upfront on arrival. In the end we moved on after three nights leaving a credit which I had to chase."
2,Nice Property; frigid staff,"While the room that I had was fantastic and the property has the expected ""boutique-y"" vibe of the W brand, the staff is, by and large, arrogant, pretentious, and fake. While I love the property, I loathe the experience that comes with staying here. The JW Marriott is right up the street from here. Do yourself a favor and stay there instead. Now that the Marriott acquisition of Starwood is complete, you can enjoy your SPG status and have a significantly better level of customer service than the W Austin offers."
5,Great Location - Great Hotel,I spent four nights at the W in a standard room - was unsure what to expect as my experience with W's before has been a bit hit and miss.Checking in the staff were super friendly - room was surprisingly big (although no coffee machine).Mini bar stocked with lots of tempting goodies and bathroom large - made even better as they didn't have a tub but made up for it with a huge shower.Food for the meetings we were at was great and the bars downstairs also great - amazing collection of vinyl and requests taken.Gym was a big hit - huge and extremely well equipped.Location is great - you can walk to all the live music without being right on top of it.I would stay here again for sure.
5,Comfortable and quiet,"I arrived at noon and had a 20 minute wait for my room to be ready. This was convenient given the lobby wifi. My room, on the 10th floor, was outfitted in a highly contemporary style and was very comfortable. The shower is a subway-tiled built-in which works quite well. Those traveling with a non-intimate companion should be aware that there's no real privacy between the bathroom and the bedroom. The toilet alone is contained within a separate room. There are plenty of mirrors, more than enough light, and very comfortable bedding. The HVAC is quiet and holds temperature well. I heard no noise from hallway, surrounding rooms, or the outside. The cost is a little steep, but consistent with surrounding hotels. Two issues:1) The AC outlets available under the writing desk are in a location which receives no light from any fixture in the room. As a result, finding your way to fitting a plug in an outlet requires a flashlight.2) There are several bottled waters in the room. Some are free. Some are not. Choose wisely.All comfortable, and highly recommend."
5,Nice location,"Great Hotel , Room are very comfortable, very good service, very fast check in . very Clean and A lot of Taxis close. Nice Pool area and Spa. We use to go on foot to places to eat or drinks , their location is great"
5,Kool Vibe,"very relaxing after a 10 hour drive, rooms super comfortable. The living room staff was very nice and knowledgeable. Bartender made me a couple of great craft cocktails that we legit. Got a great night sleep and the wheels were at the door when i was ready to leave"
5,Wonderful corner room,"We were in Austin for an event our daughter organized to benefit a nonprofit. The event raised + 65k. Hooray! Over 5 days we did over 45 hours of support services for the NGO. When it was time to rest the W was solid and our room was great. Nice bath and shower and living area. The only issue we had was resting on Sunday afternoon in our room while a weekly pool party, with a DJ, rocked the Wet Bar. That was quite the scene. Not our scene. But we rested anyway. The pool also was great early each morning. Though not designed as a lap pool it worked. Even with another joined us. Three swimming circles worked. Recommended."
5,"Fabulous Room Attentive Staff. Great Location, Center of it All,",We stayed one night in Austin to visit. Staff was incredible even though it was super busy. Alice Cooper was playing the venue in the building - we didn't know that. We were treated like we were vips. The room was extremely comfortable and clean.A short walk to everything. We enjoyed Italic Italian near by and ran on the Lady Byrd trail. Next time we will rent kayaks at the boathouse.We will stay again on our next visit in October.
2,Middle Aged Frat Party,"If you want to hang out with a bunch of old people getting sloppy drunk in the pool, this is the hotel for you. Plus the pool is not big enough for the number of old drunks lounging around. The water was murky be about 4pm.The rooms are also starting to show wear and tear. Still okay, but not what you would expect in a hotel like the W.Also, BEWARE! The W has posted no trespassing sign outlawing legal, law-abiding citizens from carrying concealed, including its own customers. In Texas this means a misdemeanor charge, even if properly licensed.Nice bar though."
4,Quick weekend trip,"We decided to stay here for a weekend trip to Austin to see a concert. We chose the W because of its location. Its close to a lot of restaurants, bars, and congress bridge if you want to check out the bats. We actually didn't mind the walk down to south congress.When it came to the the help everyone at the hotel was great from check in to check out. The hotel has a very modern feel and seems to be a popular choice for younger couples, bachelor / bachelorette parties from what we noticed. We didn't make it to the pool but had a view from our room and it looked nice. If you have a car it does cost maybe $30 / night or so to park, I'd recommend calling to check the exact amount.The only negative thing we experienced is it smelled like someone got sick in the hallway so it smelled for our two days there when we walked to the elevator. Other than that minor detail it was a good experience & we enjoyed the hotel."
5,"Very posh hotel that has a great drinks bar, restaurant, & outdoor pool","Great location, decent size room, & great amenities! Friendly staff, great pool, amazing restaurant! If you're into a modern&/or hip hotel, you will like this property. The crowd out by the pool consists largely of 20 somethings & hipsters. But the drinks are great the pool is huge so there is plenty of room to find your little spot. The room itself is beautiful and welcoming and the view was amazing. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. My wife and I both slept like rocks. The common area and bar were very nice. They had such an awesome vibe to them (especially with the fireplace). The restaurant does a great breakfast. Overall, I would say this is a great hotel for a weekend getaway as a couple."
4,I'll Be Back,Have stayed twice at this hotel for a convention & few days of pleasure. Both times enjoyed pleasant & efficient service. Upon arrival this time our room smelled bad (musty maybe) and we were immediately moved to a different room with a better view.Be sure to ask for complimentary cold bottled water every time you come in at the desk. Also have a seat in the funky chairs in the lounge-you may not leave.
5,Favorite Hotel For A Little Getaway With The Boyfriend,"I loved my experience at this hotel. It was convenient and efficient. After a long drive this hotel was a dream sight, The room was beautiful and welcoming and the view was amazing. The bed was unbelievably comfortable, it's my new standard for comparison among other hotels. The bathroom was a little awkward with it being so open. The shower was view-able and the toilet was behind another door. Not something i'm entirely use to but it added to the whole romantic vibe for my boyfriend and I. Even the products they supply you with a great (facial wash, shampoo etc. all Bliss Brand Products) The common area and bar were absolutely beautiful. They had such an awesome vibe to them especially with the fireplace. Overall this is a wonderful hotel and I'd absolutely recommend it for a happy couple."
4,"Modern vibe, great restaurant","If you're into hip and modern you will like this property. Management was very accommodating when our rooms were located in a noisy corner. Both bar and restaurant were excellent. Delicious breakfasts and friendly service! Hipster and couple friendly, not family forward."
4,Amazing!,"Great location, decent size room, great amenities! Room service was expensive but very good. Friendly staff, great pool, amazing restaurant! Just wish the night at the lobby would last longer, we came back from 6th and went there for a last drink but it was already over!"
5,Perfect Getaway,"My fianc√© and I stayed at the W Austin this past weekend to celebrate his birthday and had a wonderful time. The staff was friendly and genuinely cared about our experience. Javier from the front desk, Travis from the restaurant, and Drue from front office all took the time to get to know us and each played a role in providing us with the perfect weekend. We can't wait to go back!"
4,Good time @ the W,"Long anniversary weekend in Austin was based out of the W. A great central location, close enough to walk to 6th St, as well as the bridge where the bats fly from, but far away enough to not hear any noise from it. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. Our room was on an upper floor and faced the Colorado River, so perhaps this also helped with the noise. Decor was modern and funky, room was just right (I believe it was a ""Spectacular"" room, which might be a slight exaggeration). The valet parking was always polite if not always prompt, but they were always very busy as well. We always ate at places outside the hotel, so can't advise on that. The pool area is spacious, the pool itself is a rather thin sliver of water. The days we were there, there was some sort of business gathering/function every day, so the pool was packed with people who were probably 15-20 years younger than us, with terrible music, but they were gone by 6 or 7. One day we joined them anyway, and wondered about the youngish people in Austin. The spa was quite good, though I'd categorize the massages as more relaxing than anything else. I'd stay here again."
5,What a cool place!!,"We are very well traveled, but this was the first time we every stayed at a ""W"" hotel. We live in Austin, Tx., and went downtown to see a concert (Alice Cooper at the Moody Theater). We thought we'd stay downtown after the concert, to enjoy the Austin ambiance - and not have to drive home after the concert :). The W is attached to the Moody Theater, so it was very convenient for us! We had such a good experience that I felt inspired to write this review!PARKINGWe did the valet parking.. $39 per night. Average for Austin - it is what it is. The W team was very prompt and attentive in meeting/greeting us and helping with our bags.CHECK INCheck in was seamless. Our room was ready (we checked in about 3:00 PM). Although we are new to SFG family of hotels, they treated us like royalty. I was impressed.THE ROOMWe booked a ""Wonderful"" room. They have names for their room categories: Cozy, Wonderful, Spectacular, etc., etc. Our room was large and had 2 queen beds, 14th floor. Picture of Janis Joplin on the wall. Great Bluetooth sound system. Minibar fridge and snacks were available. Our room was very modern looking and clean: shades of grey and white - very cool. There was an in-room safe and W robes. We had to ask for a coffee maker, but they delivered a Keurig coffeemaker with tons of k-cups, liquid creamer, sweetener. I was impressed again! They could use a bit more space for storage, as there were really no drawers in the room - more of an armoire with a couple of shelves. We were only staying overnight, so no big deal for us. Lots of free water in the room (some also ""smart water"" for sale).LOUNGEAmazing - their lounge had I believe 4 separate areas - see their website for details. The Living Room had a fireplace with thousands (?) of 12"" vinyl records. Great sound system covered all areas. Outside bar as well.FOODWe had appetizers before our concert: chicken satay and popcorn with truffle oil. Wow to both! The next morning we had breakfast - I had eggs benedict and my wife had an omelet. Both were excellent - very tasty! Eggs were just right and accompanying potatoes were crispy and well-seasoned. Our server, Travis, was very nice, attentive and helpful.\OVERALLOur new favorite place in downtown Austin! We'll definitely be back! You would not be disappointed with this place :). Also, the location is perfect."
4,Staycation,Weekend getaway with my girlie! Had a blast but the pool area was pretty dirty and overly packed. Couldn't even get in. Great location however. Tons of clubs and bars around. Short walk to dinner at 2nd Street and brunch at Jo's!
5,"Hotel with Personality , Class and some Austin Flare!","Hubby and I stayed here for our anniversary. We wanted something unique but special for the occasion. I splurged, but it was worth every cent. We ended up hanging at the hotel. Enjoying food and all the nooks and crannies they have built in for hanging out and relaxing. Lots of good music to be had. We will be back."
5,Thoughtful and Energetic,"I visited Austin for the first time in early August and had an excellent experience at The W. The staff was friendly, helpful and courteous. The various restaurant/bar options were great! My room was spacious and attractive. The hotel was quiet. There were many younger people and families in the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
5,Staycation,"Overall I am very pleased with our stay. This is our second time staying at the hotel for a vacation in a city we love and live in. It is a beautiful hotel with great amenities. Our room overlooked the river and the pool area. We also tried the spa facilities (Away Spa) for the first time. It was real nice and if you are a ""local"" you get a discount Monday - Thursday so that was a nice bonus. Everyone from the doormen to the front desk were always welcoming and helpful. Definitely recommend staying here if you want to be in a good location in downtown Austin and love modern hotels."
5,Great Value for Upscale Hotel,We stayed in the Four Seasons on our last trip and were not terrible impressed for the money so I thought I would try the W and very happy I did. Everyone was very friendly the food at the restaurant was excellent. The housekeeping staff was great and every employee was very friendly. Check in and out was fast and easy. The workout facility was very well equipped with Precor treadmills and elipticals and free weights and machines and a Yoga room. You could send a text to the valet and your car would be in front of the hotel when you came down. The spa looked nice but I did not have time to use it. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Austin the W is it and the location is great if you want to be downtown.
5,Super Hotel Stay,"I stayed here on business and had an absolutely perfect stay. The front desk staff was excellent, courteous, helpful and professional. The room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and luxurious. Breakfast was delicious and bountiful. Location was convenient and easy to access. Will DEFINITELY come back!"
4,Modern Hotel in the Heart of Austin,"This is probably the first time I have stayed at a ""modern"" hotel like the W. While the furnishings were nice and all the staff were great, the room didn't seem to warrant the extra price. Except for the huge shower. That was wonderful.That being said, the restaurant was 5 star, the workout facility and spa was incredible. They have a really neat club off the lobby that is a great place to hang out at night. Music and dancing."
5,Great stay!,"Love this place! This was the third time I have stayed here. The rooms are great. Very modern and pretty spacious for a standard room. They have a great spa, although I will mention it isn't a true spa in that there isn't a hot tub or great waiting area in between treatments. There is an individual steam room which is nice. BUT they have some great masseuses there, eveytime I have had a massage there, it has been spot on!The hotel also has a really great bar area that has several rooms and becomes pretty lively at night. Definitely a place to stay if you are looking for a modern, lively place to stay. Has valet, room service and normal amenities. Close to many restaurants and shops."
5,Amazing hotel - the best in Austin,"Loved my stay at the W. The rooms are amazing, staff is very friendly and courteous and the pool area is beautiful. I'll definitely be back and highly recommend the W-Austin to anyone visiting from out of town."
4,Leaves a Bit to be Desired,"We had a pleasant stay in modern accommodations. Not the best for business travelers. In my opinion, younger travelers would really enjoy. We had a couple issues not addressed by staff until a second or third request. Probably wouldn't revisit, though I appreciate the design efforts."
5,Awesome W property,"I stayed in the W Austin weekly for about three months in the fall of 2015, and I very much enjoyed my stay. The staff is very friendly - within two weeks the front desk receptionist and the concierge remembered me and greeted me warmly every week when I returned.The rooms and very nice and very clean as you would expect from a W. I actually found this bed more comfortable than the Westin and slept much better here.The gym is phenomenal. The best gym I've ever experienced at a hotel - it's about on par with a paying gym if not better.For SPG travelers looking for a hotel in Austin, I prefer this over the Westin because it's removed from 6th street and the live music and bars that accompany that street."
5,Beautiful place to stay in downtown Austin!,"Loved our stay!! The rooms are nice, the pool area is very well designed! Our view was pretty! Room service was delicious along with breakfast downstairs! We walked to 6th street to enjoy the night life! We will be back! If you like nice things it is well worth the price üòä"
5,Great hotel!,"Loved it! The pool and atmosphere are awesome! The beds are very comfortable and very roomy! The location is near so many bars, restaurants and shopping. We will definitely stay again. We loved Skylar at the pool bar - he was so helpful with any questions. He saw that we need shade for our son and moved an umbrella over for us.Very trendy place to eat and stay!"
3,Gorgeous Pool,"We got to head to the W for a barre class on the rooftop. The pool was refreshing on a super hot day, though the crowd was very young and noisy. Definitely more of a place to go for a happening party than to kick back and relax. Refreshing, though somewhat overpriced drinks. Beautiful spa facility with changing rooms, showers, and all the goodies to make yourself beautiful post-pool party."
4,Party at the W,"The staff at the W are great. The hotel is cool, however I wouldn't say family friendly, it is a party atmosphere. The bars off of the lobby get very crowded with locals and guests, as do the pools when they have their splash parties on sundays, don't even think about enjoying a nice quiet time by the pool, it is a small pool filled with hundreds of people!! The room was nice and smelled great, was very clean, however their is no coffee pot and you have to go fight the crowd downstairs at the very limited coffee bar. Overall the value compared to the price, not worth the high price and the high parking price which is about $40, good location"
1,Inaccessible pool,Party pool with a DJ??? Not what we were expecting. Really disappointed.Too crowded. You can't use the pool on weekends.Really not a place to have a nice weekend. Lots of people that are not guess can access the pool area. The picture says it all.
5,Excellent stay at W Austin,"Had a great short notice stay at W Austin. Very friendly staff, great modern but appealing decoration, and very well decorated room with good view. Pool is something special and a must see ! Great atmosphere with happy people. Great service. Very nice breakfast is served in enclosed restaurant. Perfect location in Warehouse District."
5,Downtown spot,"The W Austin is a modern fun place, great location and easy to hop in and out of but is also a great spot to hang out if you have some time to pass!If you arrive late the room service is awesome and each room is a little sanctuary that has everything you need and some things you may wantüëèüèº"
5,A great location in the heart of downtown Austin,"In general I think the W hotel craze is over rated, but in Austin where hotels book out fast, I would recommend booking this one way in advance. I am from Austin, but stayed here during a few bachelorette parties with the bridal party and enjoyed the hotel atmosphere. It is a short walk to 5th and 6th street, and is a safe location to go back to at 2am when the clubs close. It would be convent for tourists, bachelorette parties, and business trips."
4,Nice place to chill,"I was there meeting a friend after the end of a conference. It's a huge place to chill out, have a beer and meet and chat with friends.We were there in the evening, the place is huge so it was not too much crowded..."
4,Smart hotel,Really nice hotel. Lots of little extras such as sewing kits at reception. The breakfast is amazing and definitely recommend the eggs benedict. Location is good also about a 10 minute walk from the main strip. Room service not a great bargain
5,Partners birthday trip,I had a one night stay and it was fantastic! After some scheduling trouble on my part Alex the moonlight manager helped me out so much getting everything ready for a special weekend with my significant other! Would definitely recommend.
5,Great night at the W Hotel,"The W Hotel is very nice, the staff was friendly and helpful. You can walk a couple of blocks and see the famous bats of South Congress bridge. Lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance. If you have time visit the pool, great modern feel."
5,"Beautiful, modern and hip","Like all W Hotels, the Austin W is very cool and well put together. Spacious rooms, killer lobby bar and restaurant, beautiful design and decoration. Centrally located, with a professional staff. The lobby bar goes on forever and is broken up into many different comfy rooms - fun and elegant."
5,Wow!,Spent the weekend at W in Austin-- location was ideal. The service was exceptional. Everything wasimmediate and prompt.Caleb checked us in with a warm and personal experience. Tim was also fantastic! He gave awesome tips about the hotel and the area.Will definitely be returning!
3,W Austin,"Excellent service, dated room, worn near broken room furniture.Somewhere in this hotel there must be rooms worthy of the W's reputation and my prior experiences with the brand. #700 was not one of them.The night scene at the bar was fantastic."
5,Amazing Staff!!,"The W is the best place to stay in Austin!!! The staff was extremely welcoming and accommodating! Modern style property with an amazing pool! Great atmosphere,I recommend staying here on your next visit to Austin."
3,"Great location, average hotel","A little pricey for what it is, but with a great location, it makes it an ideal place to stay if you need easy access to downtown and Lady Bird Lake.We stayed in a double queen bed room, which was comparable to a standard hotel room. As with the W chain, the rooms are a little quirky, with the shower being exposed to the hall and glass windows. They will provide a curtain upon request if needed.Overall, the rooms are very clean and the service from the staff was fantastic. The location is great, within walking distance to numerous restaurants and the lake.I highly recommend this for anyone that likes to explore the downtown area by foot and wants to be in the nearby vicinity to the lake."
4,Nice but not great,"This W hotel is relatively consistent with other W properties. Modern and relatively comfortable. Not too quaint - like a regular room. Except there's no bathroom door.Hardware is ok, not necessarily luxurious. My complaint is the shower head - very poor water pressure. Almost checked out of the hotel because of it. To be honest, next time I will likely try a different hotel. Not a bad experience but not enough for me to return."
5,Mr Williams,They were very hospitable and extremely courteous. The hotel was nice as well. Keep up the good work. The amenities were great and get a higher level room for a great view. Trace restaurant also has great food. Use Fare to travel around the city and visit ACL if you can
5,Better than expected,"Spa, food, service and facility was better than expected for the money. Every part of the trip was enjoyable. The service honestly rivals the Four Seasons for half the price. It was close to all things Austin and Fare makes it easy to get around town. Parking is pricey but I saw after we booked they have package deals that include parking."
5,Modern convenient and Fun,The W Austin is a really chic modern hotel in a great location. I used to frequent Austin often and would always stop in the W for a drink at the bar if I didnt stay. The rooms arent huge but big enough. The staff is always friendly and courteous. I like that its in walking distance of all of the nightlife in Austin. The pool is great place to hang out during the day on a weekend. Lots of bachelor and bachelorette parties.
3,"view was nice, beds..not so much","we got a room on the 6th floor..if you really want to get an un-obstructed view of downtown Austin, then please get a room on the 10th floor or higher....the view on the 6th floor was nice...the beds are hard as a rock and the pillow collapse down to nothing. the shower was very nice! oh, and the snacks that are in the room are very pricey...$6 for a candy bar $5 for a small canister of pringles. however, they give you 2 free water bottles for any outside excursions! the customer service dept is great!"
4,Upscale & modern with convenience,"The W is a great place to stay if you're looking for a central location to restaurants, bars & shopping. 2nd Street district is half a block away & the ACL Moody Theatre is on the same block. Very modern decor with cool bar inside hotel and Starbucks on the corner!"
4,Nice boutique hotel,"Just returned from a 3 night stay for a business meeting that was held at the W in Austin.The rooms are clean and modern and I ended up with a room that had a small swimming pool for a bath tub.The lobby bars were great and the bartenders took good care of us.The meeting facilities were great and the staff was excellent in meeting our team's needs.The only downside is the price, but you get what you pay for."
1,"Only stay here if you're under 25, don't care about service and it's only for a weekend.","Just returned from the W in Austin. We usually stay at the 4 Seasons amd wanted a change - truly wish we hadn't.Positives are the location of the hotel - close to many great restaurants.Rooms are also cool. We were upgraded (Amex) to a corner suite which was bright and cool. Had great views of River and pool and city. 2 tvs. Big tub. Big separate shower. Desk and huge couch.Cool bar areas including the ""secret bar"" and vinyl room (tons of old vinyls line a huge wall) and a front bar by Windows. All have lots of cumfy chairs and couches. Service in front bar is great.That's it.Service is awful. We were trying to surprise some friends who were coming for their birthday. Talked to everyone at front desk 3 times and came up with a plan. They couldn't execute it and ruined the surprise (by saying ""are you with so and so"" when they checked in). Duh.We waited forever to even be approached to order a drink (even when we were one of 3 tables in ""secret bar"" - it was Sunday night so place was deserted. Both waitstaff and guests).Tried to get hotel car to Uchi- were told the driver had gone home for the night - it was 8pm. Then the guy we asked to get us a cab was the hotel driver! (We were able to use it one time which is how we knew). He wasn't even able to get us a cab so we had to get our car out of valet.Bar staff at pool bar were so rude. Couldn't be bothered to help anyone actually at the bar - just the wait staff.Never replenished the complimentary water in room - even after requesting it 3 times! Housekeeping didn't come till after 6 on Saturday (even though requested at 1 because we wanted to nap without interruption). Called at 4 and 6 to request and it was as if it was a hassle (and an usual request). On Monday - the day we were checking out - they came by at 9 loudly knocking.The final kicker was to come home and find they had placed a $5900 ""hold"" on our Amex - even though we checked out and our entire 3 night bill was $1800. I was told they estimate charges and it takes 5-7 business days to remove the hold.Bottom line - we won't ever be back. Sad for such a good brand and pretty hotel."
4,Wonderful Downtown Hotel,"Came to Austin for a girl's two night getaway. The hotel is in a great location. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The vibe is very ""hipster"" in the lobby and bar. Our room was clean, quiet and the beds very comfortable. The room rate and parking rates were expensive. That said, we did enjoy our stay."
5,Awesome Customer Service and Atmosphere,"First I need to give a shout out to the following staff members: Jordan Hudson, Caleb Parsons, and Joe Fisher. As well as the entire Risk Team at the Wet Deck. I stayed at the W Hotel while on a business trip. I was thoroughly impressed with the politeness, level of customer service, and free amenities provided by the hotel.It was luck, but I happened to be pool side during one of their frequent events. The Ferris Bueller's Day-Off themed pool party rocked...free drinks, food, live performances, and the entire staff was dressed up to reflect the theme.And...it goes without saying that the hotel room had an incredibly comfortable bed and artistic decorative flare. I would definitely stay here again."
5,Jessie Mettler for Hotelier of the Year,"This was my first time staying at the W in Austin. My wife and I decided to spend our Anniversary in Austin (we are from San Antonio) and I chose the W based on the modern look, proximity to 6th street and affinity for younger crowd drawing hotels (we both are 27).I booked a king wonderful room and requested a high floor. About a week before our trip, I started recieving emails from the hotel conceirge, Jessie Mettler. Now, I always like to recognize individuals who go above and beyond but there are not enough characters allowed on this page to explain how amazing this hotelier was. She reached out to me and asked if there was anything she could do to enhance our trip. Of course, I sarcastically remarked ""a gold brick on our bed at arrival would be cool"" but then went on to see if she had packages, enhancements or add on's I could look at. Jessie was able to set us up with an awesome batch of chocolate covered strawberries!When we arrived, the valet was very curteous and helpful with his information. I don't let anyone drive my car but I felt good about this staff handling M'lady (car's name). Walking in, the hotel is very clean and modern. The desk was my only 'issue' if you want to call it an issue. I have worked in hotels for 11 years and was a front office manager for 4, so I am oversensative. The FD person did not pick his head up or wave us over and with their layout, I was not sure if I had to wait for the other desk to my right or if he was availble. Not a huge thing but just confusing.When we got up to our room, which was upgraded by JESSIE (thank you again), we found the chocolate covered strawberries, 2 of Austin's local brews and a random box covered in dollar signs and gold glitter. I was so confused, as they were doing a charity event at the hotel, i thought it had something to do with that. About 2 hours later, we were around town and it hit me.... that was the gold bar I had asked Jessie for earlier in the week! Jessie, I hope you read this but you are a ROCKSTAR. Like I said, I have been in hotels for 11 years, front office 4 years of that and the rest in sales. I have seen some awesome hoteliers but none have reached the level you are at. If you lived in SA, I would hire you at my hotel. You can't train this kind of stuff people! There is no manual to tell them to do off the wall things like this. Jessie provided a personalized touch to something that was very special to me and my wife. I will always remember what you did and the way I felt stupid when I couldn't figure out what it was hahaha. Way to go Jessie!As for our room, it was great. Spacious, clean and a great view. Bed was comfortable and plush. My only complaint is the pillows looked fluffy and soft but flattened to pancakes upon impact.Overall great stay, will definitely be back... PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF JESSIE METTLER!!!"
3,"Long on Chic, Short on Service and Cleanliness","Drove to Austin from Dallas, chose the W because they are one of just a few Hotels in Austin that have a Tesla charger. Upon arrival, had to wait in a valet line for 15 minutes because they were short staffed. The hotel was very slow because it was Memorial Day. When the valet finally got to us, there was not a bellhop to be found. No big deal, my wife and I can manage just fine, but I was under the impression that the W was a 5-star brand. After checking in, still no sign of a bellhop, so we made our way to the 6th floor and my first impression upon exiting the elevator was how dirty the carpet was. The hall carpet is a grey color, but the walking path down the center was brown with spots. The room was clean compared to the hallway, but there were issues. First and foremost it is apparent that Starwood is playing the thermostat game (common for low-end brands,) which is where they calibrate the thermostat about 5-7 degrees warmer than what is displayed. So when people crank it down to 70, they are really setting it to 75, which cuts their energy bill. The bed is comfortable, even with the waterproof plastic coated mattress protection pad like your grandmother uses on her guest bed when the grand kids visit. This tends to make the bed hot, but you can't turn the mattress over like you can your pillow. The top linens are plush but way too warm for a 73 degree room, which is the temperature you get if you crank the thermostat to it's lowest setting of 65 degrees. In the morning you can de-sweat in the shower, which feels like 5 people are spitting on you. The shower head even makes a spitting sound to trick the senses that it is delivering a real shower, but you know it's not since you can barely get the shampoo out of your hair. Oh well at least you can make yourself a nice cup of coffee before you get dressed. Oh snap, there is no in-room coffee, remember this is no Holiday Inn. At least the chic decor feels cool, that is if your jeans have embroidered pockets with the word AFFLICTION across your butt. If not, go next door to the JW Marriott."
5,Great Job,"About a month ago my friends and I went to Austin for the weekend. We ended up booking a room at the W Hotel. We had a fantastic time at the property. People were friendly, it was clean, and the acomidations were top shelf. Big thanks to Jordan at the Welcome desk."
5,"Standard Swanky W, Fantastic Staff","The W in Austin has the regular vibe you expect of W Hotel with the chic lobby area and bar/cocktail lounge, as well as your rooms that are well fitted. Two boosters for this hotel would be the pool area - a neat, relaxing, and trendy outfit with good (overpriced) drinks, as well as music to match; and the staff - this was probably one of the most polite and thoughtful staffs I've experienced at a W Hotel, and just in general at hotels (including stays at Four Seasons, Waldorf, etc.). It could be that southern charm, but it fit them well. Oh and the location is absolutely perfect! The only negative about this place was the timeliness of turning over a room - mostly happening around 5 or 6 p.m. in the evening, but it was tolerable enough. I would recommend staying here!"
5,Overnight Business Trip,Stayed at the W for business meeting next day. First time in Austin and was also considering the JW and Four Season. Glad I chose the W to stay. Nice boutique hotel with nice amenities. Clean hotel and room was excellent. Lobby and hallways were a little gloomy with concrete walls and little sunshine but that was the decor and intentional. Staff I would say was average. Great restaurant and bar with DJ at night. Good place to hang out and meet/watch people. Great location within the city. Would likely stay again if in town.
5,Hip Fun Hotel with great beds,We had a great time at the W. They have several party rooms that are rocking after 10pm. It's a party everyone is welcome to join. Rooms are far enough of away that it's quite. The W is within walking distance of 6th street and a short bike ride to Rainye street. Use the public bike right outside. Great location and fun!
3,Clean but not spectacular,Clean room and comfortable bed. Room is very modern in design but not welcoming. Customer Service was not good. Concierge was non existent and I had to search to get someone to help. Expected a much better overall experience.
4,Posh space,"Stayed for only one night, but will go back! Loved the room and city view, you can request your view! Large bathroom and shower, awesome bedding and sheets, offers robes and bliss body care products. The W offers so much, down to the time you wake up, you can request your coffee if you want and the time, they will leave you a door hanger to fill out before midnight. They offer a $39/ night valet with a text retrieval option. If you're into the night scene, this IS the place to be. Though you may hear some music from their bar, it's not too bad once you're laying in bed snuggled in the comfort of their bedding! I fell right to sleep. I wanted to see more amenities, but will need a longer stay. They also offer pet amenities as this is a pet friendly hotel with no size discrimination.Two thumbs up! Also look out for the mats at the elevators... They will change during the day, what a fantastic touch, they really do think of it all."
4,"Incredible service, great location",We stayed at had a conference at The W in Austin. The staff and catering teams were outstanding and the overall venue for a small-medium conference was great. Rooms were modern and spacious with okay desk/working area. Costs for food and drinks in hotel was really pricey. About a 10 minute walk to the 6th Street area.
5,Amazing!,"We celebrated my Friend Birthday at the W Austin. David Cecere was Incredible. The concierge at the W fulfills any wish that you can dream of. I want to thank David for doing such an amazing job. We love the W hotel it's one of our favorite. Everything about this hotel is 5 stars; The rooms, the food, the bar and the most important the concierge."
5,"Great Hotel, perfect location, great service.","Stayed 3 nights- EXCELLENT service! room are quite small but the great service makes up for it. Hotel is clean, great workout room, pool is nice,can't say enough about the great service. Michael was so helpful- recommended at few local spots and all his recommendations were spot on. Love the W Hotels...."
5,"Outstanding hotel, great downtown location and excellent service","W Austin is in a great location in downtown Austin, just walking distance from most landmarks, close to the convention center and to access routes.The hotel is everything you can expect, with a great lounge to relax, a living room space and a couple of bars that give you the options to chose the ambience that you like most.Rooms were spacious - more than usual W - and well cared, the speaker to connect your music was the only thing that wasn't at the quality level.The gym is very ample and well equipped, if you want to run, lift or just stretch you're covered; personally I preferred to go for a run to the river loop which you can ask for a map at the concierge. Also, it has a good outdoor pool.Trace is the restaurant and food is great, light and with foodie touch. If you want a quick bite, there's a Starbucks right next door in Lavaca and 3rd.The only comment is that during certain times of the day the front of the hotel gets packed with cars and gets difficult to walk through or for your Uber to find space.All in all great hotel and experience."
5,Wonderful Facility,"If you're looking for someplace that has its finger on the pulse of Austin, the W is it.From the beautiful lobby, the river views, open air dining, multiple clubs within a club, to the roof top pool with bar and room service.It doesn't get any better."
5,Holy Cow!!!,"So we have all stayed in nice hotels and not so nice hotels. Well the W is off the charts. Personally, I think once your in the room at most hotels they are all about the same. Not the W. The colors POP. The decor is great. Outside of the room, the hotel is nice and the staff is exceptionally friendly. If you are looking for a romantic getaway, stay here. You significant other will be impressed. If you are in town on business, the best restaurants are close by. Ya gotta try it!!"
5,Great Customer Service during a time of need,"I recently received outstanding customer service in re: to a particular stressful time in my families life re: health. My appreciation to the team at the W Austin, namely Jan Shaw & Drew McQuade, for their understanding and considerations as associated with my visit."
5,The W Hotel Austin is a great place to stay!,"I found the W Hotel Austin a wonderful place to stay, including the pool/outdoor patio, restaurant and bar. The hotel is located a few minutes walk to Sixth Street and all the downtown music club and restaurant venues. Everything including my room was very clean and comfortable. All the staff was very friendly and were very helpful in offering advice on the surrounding activities. The security staff was also extremely helpful and quick in locating and returning items that were left in my room. I would recommend the W Hotel to everyone staying in downtown Austin."
2,W hotel was not what it should have been..the hotel was dirty,"While customer service was good at the W, the place wasn't in good repair and rugs were dirty. I expected more from this hotel.The staff was friendly and efficient. I left a bag in the room and had to go back after checkout. The security person got me into the room quickly and efficiently (with appropriate ID, of course.)The furniture in the room had seen better days. There is no place to put your clothes. The small closet was filled with their guest robe (which I never use) and there were no drawers. The carpeting in hallways was stained. The gym is very nice but the music in the gym was ear shattering and annoying for my taste. I didn't use the pool but that area was beautiful."
2,Disappointing property,"Sometimes trying to be uber chic is losing attention to people's needs and comforts. This is a perfect example of that. Cool and hip (if those are still words in use) the decorators/designer's have lost their attention to detail. There is practically no room on the vanity for anything. Women have lots of stuff! We were 3 women and well we ran out of space very quickly. The open concept bathroom leaves little room for modesty. Even if you bring your undies and clothes into the bathroom there is nowhere to put anything down. A hook just doesn't suffice. Frankly men would do better here. There are shaving mirrors in the shower. Oh the shower....that's another story. With all the fancy shower heads available you'd think maybe they would have invested in one. Not adjustable, it just spit out a spray. The closet is minuscule. The rest of the hotel was fine. The lounge area was comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful."
4,Nice downtown location,"We were in Austin for a conference at the Conference Center. It was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the convention center and it was a safe and nice walk. The rooms were clean and modern. The bed was super comfy. We did use room service 2 times. One time it was a confusing event and we called down after 40 minutes that they had delivered our drinks to another room - strange, but they came up in a few minutes to right it. I told them it was my husband's birthday when I booked the room and they brought up a couple of complimentary local beers and some nuts. That was fun and surprising. It is a very good location and we didn't use a car the entire 5 days we were in Austin."
5,Great Hotel and Service,Stayed here one night. Chose W Austin because of it's location. Upgraded to a suite in room 603. Not much of a few from this floor level. Lobby very busy upon check-in. Suite was big and spacious. Nice bathroom. Had breakfast at hotel restaurant Trace and was very good with excellent service. Am reviewing my stay a few months after stay so apologize for not giving much details.
5,Best Hotel Service,"If you are looking for a hotel this is the one!The moment we got to the W we were greeted with welcome arms. It was our first night away from our baby and we were spending a romantic night away, but we were still nervous. I had asked for champagne to be ready for us in the room to calm the nerves. :) It was to our surprise that there was a gift bag waiting for us. I found a W onesis for our baby. It brought a huge smile to my face. The service was amazing and our view was excellent. I have never had such quality service from a hotel before! The W exceeded my expectations in every way..."
5,Weekend visit to Austin,I can only say that everyone was extraordinarily nice. From the gentleman that opened the door to the checkin desk and concierge.I especially appreciated David Cecere at the concierge desk. He was well informed and knew what places we should go for the evening.Brandon the bell boy was very helpful with luggage and getting us into the car as we left.Hotel is fabulous as all W's are.
3,"Way overpriced, poor service, rooms are nothing special.","On a positive note, the location is convenient to everything downtown. I have stayed here twice and will never stay here again. I know they are very busy, but it was congested and unorganized when I tried to valet, and that is the only option. At $38 a night I would think it would be better. We were there on a busy weekend, so the price for a standard room with two beds was $566. The first time I stayed there it was much less, but the rooms are average at best."
4,"Well-located hotel, spa disappointing","Met a childhood friend in Austin for a girls' getaway. Great location, right next to Austin City Limits and the river, so great for a morning walk/run and late-night entertainment. Also easy walk to all the Austin attractions, clubs, neighborhoods. The hotel is a typical W, has a cool vibe, trends younger than other SPG brands. Our reservations were a little messed up, but they upgraded us nicely, so all was forgiven. Our corner room/mini suite was lovely, with amazing views. The spa was underwhelming, a little small, and our reservations had to be rescheduled because there was a snafu with the masseuse. The services were good, not great, especially considering the price. Overall, a good experience in a fun city, but not as great as I expected."
2,Wrong Crowd,"I'm developing a distaste for W hotels. The fake ""hip"" concept, buttressed by loud music piped in everywhere, tacky decor, pretentious names of services (""wet"", ""wow suite"") and rooms, etc. Well, I am not disappointed by all of that at W in Austin, because its a choice, and I knew what to expect. What really ticked me off where two things:1) The crowd. Many unsavory characters, I will not spend the time describing them here, except to mention a couple thrusting at me from an elevator clearly very high (snorting as they stumbled forward with unsteady walk). It seems that the fake ""hip"" concept attracts a certain crowd...2) Jerking me around as a platinum SPG member with room upgrades. First, they've mad a mistake on our reservation. Then they told us that they could put us in room A, and transfer them the next day to room B (a suite). When we transferred, they told us that for the 3rd night we'd have to move again. It took vigorous protesting, and they budged only after a high level manager showed up. Etc., etc."
5,Girls Weekend,"My girlfriend was correct when she said ‚ÄúWow this hotel really tries hard to make its guest happy."" The rooms were immaculate! Our concierge Marissa was excellent and was able to accommodate special request for us. Awesome! Great d√©cor, great location, and most of all great service! We will be returning next time in Austin!"
5,Consistently the best,"I get to stay at The W at least once a month between traveling to Austin for work or leisure. The W knows how to do it right. I wanted to take the time and acknowledge a few reps who remember my girlfriend and I every time we arrive and provide us first class service. Mike from the front desk is great and anticipates our needs and exceeds expectations every time. The concierge David Cecere makes sure that all of our reservations our made in advance at our favorite places. I literally do nothing other than show up. Hands down the best! I did have one small issue while checking in and it was handled immediately and without hassle. It was probably my fault for checking in so late. I received an apology letter after my checkout from the director of rooms, Joanna Mccreary. This meant‚Ä¶"
5,W WOW,"I was there for business.The facilities were also great, but primarily the staff was amazing! Everyone in the staff was genuinely content to be there. The concierge was phenomenal. I had an issue and they helped me drive me to the location I needed during my lunch. I would definitely return!"
4,SXSW,Good and efficient hotel for business purposes. Great location downtown and good hefty texan breakfast . The hotel team is friendly. Starbucks is literally on the corner of the hotel. Other restaurants are a block to two away. You are at the middle of everything.
5,A nice splurge,"Took my wife here for a weekend to celebrate her big birthday. We normally stay more frugally but we wanted to splurge for this and it was worth it. It started before we got there when the concierge emailed me asking if she could help me plan our visit. The hotel staff was very nice. Our room was very nice. We did have a problem with the street music and they whisked us to another room - they even moved our stuff for us. Got a real paper each day (no offense to USA Today, but it was nice to read a full newspaper, even on Sunday), couple bottles of water, starbucks gift cards and uber vouchers. The location downtown was PERFECT- everything was within walking distance, especially the path for running along the river. We did use the Away spa and had a nice massage. I would‚Ä¶"
5,Great place to stay,"I was there this weekend for the last few days of South by Southwest. The ambiance was very much so like you would expect in Austin. It has a modern feel to it- we loved it! I was a bit disappointed with the service at the front desk, but the hotel itself is wonderful. There is a great breakfast place literally in front of the hotel called Taverna. However, I highly recommend ""El Naranjo"" which is a few minutes away."

5,W Austin has a Rock Star in Colton Pollock!!!,"This is our tenth year attending KGSR SXSW Morning events. Colton Pollock is the FIRST to make sure it runs smoothly!!! He is the FIRST to come outside and make sure that everything was going well from the beginning and all the way through the event. Colton is professional, friendly, organized and CONSISTENLY representing the W Austin in the manner it is expected. THANK YOU COLTEN for being a true Rock Star! We had a Great time! And LOVE the W Austin!!!"
5,Warm Texas Welcome at W,"From arrival at the door, through the check-in, and beyond, everyone at the W Austin is very welcoming and go out of their way to be helpful. I was arriving for SXSW and had boxes of swag and they went out of their way to unpack my car and get everything upstairs to my room. The rooms are modern and trendy (not your grandma's hotel). There's help whenever you need it. Had a great view of the city. Austin isn't a huge town, but this location is very handy for getting to convention center or down to the riverside for a walk or run. Thanks to everyone at the W - will see you again in 3 weeks!"
5,Great place for family outdoor play,"This is near my daughter and son-in-law and the love taking their 18 mo old son there to rip around and play off some energy. Very family friendly, free fun!There are slides and different climbing scape on soft mulch ground. Plenty of room for parents to visit while being very close to playing children."
5,Couldn't Have Been Any Better!,"From the time you check in, until the time you leave, every staff member treats their guests like royalty! Even after check-out, Eli and Leo (valet), exceeded our expectations with fabulous service. We asked them for their names just so we could mention what a great job they did to expedite the getting our car knowing we were in a rush.The W is where we will always stay in Austin from now on!-TS and DR"
4,Hotel or nightclub?,"The fella and I had never stayed in a W before, and I gotta admit that it's not really my scene. It feels more like a nightclub that just happens to have a hotel in it, and we're more laid-back people. That said, I don't wanna judge it on that since that's their vibe, so I'll give you the pros and cons.Pros- The fella is an SPG member, and we got upgraded to a king suite when we got there.- The suite had a charging station with chargers for iPhone, Android, and USB devices.- The valets were on point and brought our car around within just a few minutes of us calling every time. And they seemed pleasantly surprised when we tipped.- We got free wifi with the SPG perks, and it was pretty speedy and never dropped. We did have to re-sign in every day, but no biggie.- The hotel is within easy walking distance of 6th Street, Congress Street, and the Congress Street bridge.- Check out was super easy, and the bill was accurate.Cons- Valet costs $39 a night. Holy.- We had a drink at the bar (nightclub? lounge?), and the fella got a fancy bourbon neat. It cost an arm and a leg and wasn't even 2 ounces. I also felt seriously under dressed in there.- Our suite was nice, but there was no door to the bathroom. We agreed it would be super awkward to stay there if you weren't with someone you felt totally comfortable with.- The toilet paper was the pits, and the pillows were even worse. For what they're charging, they really could upgrade both.- I emailed them before we got there to ask about toiletries since I didn't want to bring the ones they provided. I got a 3 paragraph email back from someone who'd had a lot of caffeine with a lot of exclamation points and ""Rock on!"" notes, but no actual answer. They said they carried Bliss products, but didn't tell me what was in the room. So, let me help - they give you shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion along with a cotton ball/nail file packet and shower cap. There's a hair dryer and iron in there, too."
5,Best Spa Experience in USA,"W Hotel is very convenient and the home of Austin City Limits. Rooms are modern, up to date. Walking distance to everywhere. The Spa is amazing. Heck, Willie Nelson's Statue is outside the hotel. Walking distance to Lady Bird River and promenade, close to good restaurants. Beautiful Bar area."
4,Great Location!,"The hotel was walking distance to 6th street bars and restaurants. The rooftop had a beautiful view of downtown Austin.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions.I really liked the hip decor in the lounge and bar area. Overall, I felt very welcomed and appreciated."
5,Couple Get Away,"This is an excellent hotel, with a great location and very nice rooms. We got upgraded to the top floor, away from the elevators due to our SPG status. The 4pm check-out was another bonus. We did have an issue with our Spa treatment pricing - which was corrected by the staff. Best of all, we were greeted initially and acknowledged every time we walked by and checked out by Nikhil, who was very helpful and genuinely wanted to make sure our stay was what we wanted it to be. We did have one issue with service - the Concierge desk was not always staffed and those staffing it didn't seem all that interested in helping us find good places to eat."
5,"Absolutely a FUN place to stay in downtown Austin! Modern, Hip, Great Vibe and Perfect Location","If you are looking for a great time in Austin, then the W Austin is the place to stay. The location is perfect for restaurants, shopping, running along the water and enjoying downtown Austin.The rooms are nice, and the staff is wonderful!I rode the elevator with Shaquille O'Neal; even though I did not know who he was. Obtained information about having a succulent display in my house and loved watching a sophisticated lounge during the day turn into an evening night club.The workout room was empty, clean and the equipment was new. The spa looked beautiful even though I did not have a service.Overall, I had a fantastic time at the W in Austin!"
5,"Modern, Hip, Convenient Location","Stayed one night for a business meeting. Location: central diet own area with lots of food and shops. Close to meeting.Common Area: very modern and hip. But not cold, lots of art and still feels cozy with several areas/nooks for sitting and chatting.Restaurant: Pricey but very tasty food. Excellent service from the waitress.Room: as SPG platinum, upgraded to a huge corner suite. Comfortable bed, huge sunken tub and L shaped sofa. Love the Bliss Spa amenities.Spa: got an ashiatsu massage. Wow! It was really good. There are bars on the ceiling and she walks on my back but not at full strength like Thai massage. So strong pressure but not painful. Felt great."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a fabulous hotel, in a great location, with excellent service and superb amenities. What more can you ask for? The lobby is great, provides different spaces to relax. Check-in was friendly and efficient."
5,Honesty and Service Unsurpassed!,"I attended a corporate offsite at the W Austin last week. I inadvertently left a little change purse behind in my hotel room with a pair of 18k gold Ruby earrings. I was devastated as they have great sentimental value and I didn't have the slightest hope of their being found and turned in.I called the W Austin at 4:00 am the next day and I was transferred to the night security officer, Tim Armstrong, in Lost and Found. He asked me to describe what I had lost and he confirmed that they had been found and turned in. This totally restored my faith in humanity and the excellent customer service at the hotel. He said the W takes great measure to ensure lost items are returned to their owners.I gave Tim my credit card number and the next day Fedx delivered my Ruby earrings to me in Long Island, NY.Thank you Tim Armstrong and W Hotel Austin! You guys are the best! I also appreciated all the gluten- free food you provided as options at our company event. I will recommend your hotel to all my friends and business contacts.Thanks again!Pat Loret de MolaPresidentVirtus Trade Settlement, LLC"
4,W for Wonderful Experience !,"Great customer service and the hotel is amazing! My reason for four stars instead of five is the room is a bit small and no door for the bathtub area (there is a door for the toilet). Also, I found the bathtub dangerous to get out of. Extremely deep and slippery. The whatever whenever service was a great concept but when I asked a question the lady was not very knowledgable. You cannot beat the location of this hotel and its lounge area is the best! I was disappointed that no one upon checking in told us that around the corner was a huge lounge area with restaurant and great bar area. My husband and I discovered this the last day we were there and only because someone that lives in Austin, during my training, told me it's his favorite place and wow, I agree!"
5,Service Wins,"My partner and I decided to spend a couple of days in Austin and chose to stay at the beautiful W Austin. I have never had such a fabulous upscale hotel experience. Before I even arrived to the city Leo, Alex and James from the front office began tailoring my stay to perfection. I informed them of my little getaway and to my surprise received an upgraded room upon check in from Mike who was so friendly and accommodating. Shortly after making my way to the lovely corner suite with excellent views, Can from in room dining sent up a Welcome to Austin amenity which was so sweet (literally)! Brittany from the bar was amazing and very attentive. During check out Dora made us feel appreciated by inviting us back and when I had a question about billing Savannah took initiative, answered me promptly and was so pleasant. The W Austin has a killer staff and service really is what sets them apart from the rest.- Forever loyal W guest"
5,"luxurious, modern great location","Upgraded due to Amex platinum and was pleasantly surprised by the suite with a beautiful view overlooking the river. Gorgeous room, huge windows with a living area and wrap around couch. Lounge and bar had nice, easy vibe with a lots of room. Did not stay on a weekend which I imagine is a big party scene. Very good customer service. Centrally located for everything."
5,W onderful,"Spacious, Modern, Clean, Beautiful Views of Austin.Most importantly I felt welcomed. My arrival was anticipated. My stay was made special in several very small ways that made the difference.I love the text service which really amplified the Whenever, Whatever - Mantra.Thanks W Austin!"
4,"Quiet, comfortable, great location","Recently stayed with my husband and we greatly enjoyed. We were upgraded to a large king room overlooking the water. The room was very comfortable. The lobby area has a number of stylish and comfortable sitting areas. We enjoyed the restaurant , Trace, for a great breakfast. Hotel located near great restaurants and nightlife without being too close to noisy 6th street. Great, friendly service. We will return."
4,"Nice Visit - However - Still Trying to Find My Austin ""Go To"" Hotel","Stayed here while visiting my daughter that recently relocated to Austin. It was my second visit (previously stayed at The Four Seasons). Overall, It was a nice visit. I am in my late 40's and am aware that the W chain caters more to the young, trendy and hip crowd. I am none of those, however, I saw the gym photos and was interested in trying it out as the Four Seasons lacked a real gym. Working out is important to me when I travel and the W gym didn't let me down. It was terrific and offered absolutely everything someone could want or need that wanted to workout during their stay. Hands down the best part of the hotel. The front desk service (George was my standout and deserves kudos from management for his charasmatic customer service) was wonderful - always with a smile and helpful. The location was great - walked to many restaurants, shopping and some sightseeing. The part of this hotel that hands down does not make it a five star was the just weird layout of the room. I stayed in a corner suite so my daughter and roommate could hang out with me and have plenty of room - the bathroom design totally opens out into the suite area so they had to go into the bedroom while I got ready. The shower is open glass and no door so totally visiable from suite area? I find it hard to believe even the younger, hip trendy crowd wants to shower in front of everyone??? I travel a lot and this was by far the weirdest layout of a hotel room I have experienced. Do yourself a favor W and put a door in between the suite area and the bathroom! I am still on the hunt for the perfect hotel in Austin - probably try the JW Marriott next time. However, the W's gym was pretty fantastic and reason enough to head back."
5,Overnight stay,"My friend and I drove from San Antonio to Austin to reconnect with some friends traveling from Minnesota. We chose to stay at the W Austin and glad we did!This is a modern hip hotel with numerous places to grab and drink and relax or grab a drink and network. The selection of beverages throughout the W bars were extensive. I had wine but my friends sampled cocktails and reported all were tasty.Valet parking with seamless, check in/check out was smooth. Our room was awesome. Modern, spacious, crisp, and clean. The reception area had complimentary coffee and tea which was a nice touch. All staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful with suggestions for dinner and directions.Def a 5-star hotel experience!"
4,Hip Hotel in Austin,"W Hotel Austin, TX. Austin is a fantastic city which interestingly seems to have no 5* properties. A fair assortment of solid 4* hotels fill the void. The W performs creditably in that space. There is definitely the buzzy vibe that W hotels are known for. The bar scene is certainly hopping but there were definitely enough lounge spaces that one would not be overwhelmed if a quiet drink by the fireplace was more your speed. NFL Playoffs were happening and there was a set up of TVs in multiple locations one Sunday that didn't impact the entire bar/lounge area. Entertainment offerings were hip and au courant with a DJ coming in one evening to spin vinyl records. The guest simply needed to pick from library shelves chock full of Vinyl Albums and place it in the pile from which the DJ chose. This was a nice touch. The bar had excellent drinks and we made short work of several lemongrass martinis. The rooms themselves were very modern. We had a corner WOW suite and the separation of bathroom, living room and sleeping quarters was done in a way to enhance the feel of spaciousness. A good touch is the complimentary coffee and tea bar provided in the reception area for guests. The Trace restaurant for breakfast was good and service was pleasant. There was always a lot of activity out by valet but it was never a crush. We did not park a car but asked for directions and even restaurant locations/recommendations and were always pleasantly helped."
5,Awesome Views from Rooms,"We stayed here on our wedding night and were blown away by the service and the picturesque views of Zilker park from our top floor room. When we arrived there were chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us and a complementary bottle of Prosecco. Although we were there for only one night, the hotel's quality was apparent."
5,Weekend trip to Austin,"My friends and I drove down to Austin from Dallas one weekend for a quick visit. The W had an incredible pool that we immediately took advantage of. While expensive, drinks were great as was the service. There are also cabanas for rental. Rooms were very spacious, great bathrooms, and room service. Walking distance from 6th street (maybe 10 min or less)."
5,Customer Service Top Notch,"Our stay was fantastic. The check in with George was so smooth and Will delivered our bags promptly. To our surprise Alex had an amenity waiting for us when we opened our door. Thank you Alex! The room was absolutely beautiful and the view was stunning. With Can's amenities through out our stay we knew we would be back to The W Austin.Thank you Marissa for all the information you sent us before our stay. We went to quite a few places you suggested and loved them all.The Trace Restaurant is a must if your in Austin. Julia did a perfect job and our Christmas Family meal was delicious.Customer Service is very important to us and your hotel is Top Notch!!You can't ask for a better location. Walking distance to everything.Thank you to everyone who made our stay so perfect! We will definitely be back.As they say, Whatever, Wheneverüòé"
5,Top Notch Service,"Perfect location across from the river. Great living room bar area that's open late enough with solid food. However, the service across the board is top notch. From the business center, to the bar tender, to the front desk. I befriended a bellman named Tim over my stay who was super helpful with city insights. So much so that on Sat when ubers were taking a while out front he actually drove me to the airport with the hotel guest car. Now that's service! Will be back. Thanks."
5,Security/Lost and Found folks went above and beyond.,"Aside from everything else, the fine details of the hotel that are fantastic, John Jarrett in security was particularly helpful when I left some things behind. Kudos to the entire staff and thanks, John."
5,"Chic, new and full of energy","Awesome new addition to downtown Austin. The hotel has hip rooms and a giant bar/lounge area which is broken into multiple rooms, all with comfy pods of seating, and lighting themes. Great for drinks and catching up with friends. Hotel itself if beautiful, and staffed in classic W fashion, with helpful young professionals."
2,"Beautiful property, but locked out of room - multiple times","As others have echoed - here and other Starwood properties - the new key system is a big issue. It works, then locks out with phone and traditional keys.That by itself is a minor annoyance. The bigger issue is how the hotel handled it. The GM - who has been great on TripAdvisor, etc. with his email and phone - has refused to follow up. The front desk manager went beyond his britches and never fixed the situation.As a Starwood member since the Preferred Guest program started (1999), I've cashed in my points for Amazon gift cards. This stay debacle was the straw which broke the camel's back."
4,Great stay!,I enjoyed my stay from the start. The staff was helpful they even gave us suggestions of good places to eat. The hotel was clean and modern. Our room was clean and our bed was comfortable. We had a quiet stay and were able to rest well both nights we were there.
5,Another fantastic stay,"My wife and I have stayed at the W several times in the past (for special occasions or just a night on the town) and it has always been fantastic, our most recent stay was no exception! It had been some time since we celebrated my wife's B-day in a grand way so we decided on a night at the W. Joann (hope the spelling is right) was amazing and treated us like we were her only client/concern, to the extent of calling my better half after we returned home to make sure our stay was all that we could hope for (which it was!). We were placed in a Cool Corner Suite.......and all we can say is WOW, just WOW, every room we have stayed in (Cozy, Wonderful, & Spectacular) have been top notch but this room really made our weekend special as did the card, cake, and bubbly sent up to my wife for her B-day.Even with the new luxury hotels opening in the Austin area it is very doubtful that we will ever stay anywhere but the W on those special occasions, or when we want to spoil ourselves. My wife and I encourage anyone who has not experienced the quality and exceptional service of the W Hotel to treat/spoil/pamper yourself, you won't regret it."
2,ACL Pat Green concert,"Loved the location but, for the price of the room not worth the price! Very disappointed! Small room, small lobby, small bar area for the amount of people that was in there. Had to call about bill because it was ""over charged"" intentionally to make sure we could pay the bill!! REALLY?? Japanese soaking tub was a joke! W Hotel is proud of the fact they are the only that offers this type of tub. Again, very over rated in my opinion! The saying you get what you pay for doesn't apply to this hotel! I was really excited about staying here but was soon got ""over"" it! I realize it's a green hotel but..."
5,Great Customer Service!,Talk about great customer service! Alex Lemmers and Daniel Abarca did a wonderful job of making me and my guests feel at home and more than welcome to W Austin! thanks for all you gentleman do to make our experience great! We loived the tour of the Hotel
5,"Great hotel, excellent location","The W Hotel in Austin is in a great location in this awesome city - right next to the Austin City Limits Live at the Moody Theatre.The rooms are very spacious and well stocked, with a comfy bathrobe and slippers. A good seating area as well as work space make it ideal for business trips.The bathroom is nicely designed with plenty of Bliss products to keep anyone happy.There are so many restaurants, bars, cafes and fast food joints in this area, there's no need to drive, walking and exploring is the way to go.The Colorado River which runs through the city is a block away and there are plenty of trails for walking and running. Be sure to visit South Congress Ave over the river for its quirky shops and plethora of eating options - as long as you love beef!"
2,Quick getaway,"Wanted to find a place that was reasonably priced for an overnight stay....the staff although very polite were a little incompetent...upon check in, they actually sent me to the wrong room which was already occupied, fortunately the key didn't work and we could hear voices from inside otherwise it could have been awkward....This hotel could do with a makeover....did not sample the food....the gym looked nice but I didn't get a chance to try....the overall design of the place is probably not suitable for families, no shower doors etc..in hindsight this is typical for W brand hotels and we should have realized this...also many of the outlets didn't work in the rooms"
4,Overall great stay,Overall great stay! Had a suite with a great view. Only issue I had was maintenance coming into our room to check the air filter? Could they not wait till after we checked out? So made me a bit uncomfortable as I was just getting out of the shower.
5,Outstanding service and amazing location!,"We stayed at the W Hotel for one night over a holiday weekend, and it was an absolutely wonderful visit. Addie at the front desk was especially helpful. Our room had a really nice lake view, was very quiet, had modern furnishings, and was very comfortable. The bar/lounge is a really great setting for relaxing with a date or friends/family. The location is central to the music scene downtown, the Lady Bird Lake for running/walking, and South Congress Ave for fun and eclectic dining/shopping. Overall, the W Hotel lived up to the expectations and quality of the hotel brand. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others."
5,Both beautiful & comfortable,"This hotel is quite beautiful and comfortable.The pros:1. The rooms are quite large and well appointed2. The shower is large and awesome!3, The toiletries -- I loved the lotion so much I bought it afterwards...4. The staff -- so courteous and helpfulThe cons:1. Price"
5,"Favorite Spa in Austin, by far!","I love coming to the Away spa. Not only do I enjoy the services they offer but they have the best amenities. First, complementary valet parking. Second you can use both the work out facility AND the pool. They also offer small snacks and sparkling wine after your service so you can chill in the relaxation room and read a local magazine. It's definitely a treat when I book an appointment here!"
5,Wellness Trip with girlfriend,"I would stay at the W Hotel anytime I come to Austin. The staff was amazing. Dillion the concierge was excellent. The hotel manager Brandi was professional. The lounge, fireplace and decor was hip. Great, great atmosphere. Food at Trace was great! See you soon Austin!"
5,The Away Spa is Amazing! And Stephanie IS the best,"I had the best massage at the Away Spa. Thank you Stephanie! She was perfect and I will be back.The spa is lovely with lovely facilities including a nice waiting area with snacks, champagne if you would like, a steam shower and of course everything you need to be lovely when you leave. The massage rooms are well appointed and comfortable and the robes are very comfy.The receptionist was also very helpful and friendly. The W can be very proud of the spa experience that they offer. It was top-notch."
2,"Looks fancy, but doesn't live up to it","I stayed here on business for a week in January 2016. The hotel boasts lots of modern flare, but ultimately falls short in basic hotel standards.The rooms feature modern design, but the accessories don't work. I had two lamps that wouldn't turn on even after switching the bulbs. The clock radio had a broken leg and wouldn't stand up straight, not to mention the time was never correct and couldn't be changed.They have also added a new ""keyless"" feature that allows you to use your phone as your room key. I tried it because it sounded great to not have to keep track of a key. It would work for a few hours and then my ""keyless"" key would deactivate. After the first time, I asked for a spare regular key in case it happened again. They gave me the key, but didn't realize that when the ""keyless"" key was deactivated, all other keys are deactivated as well. So I was locked out of my room. This happened three times before I finally said ""Forget it.""Overall, the hotel really is just a step below the level it boasts. Take care of the hotel and learn the technology and the hotel will be a lot better."
5,Great hotel!,"I stayed in Austin for a couple days and loved my stay at the W. The staff are awesome, the rooms are spacious and modern and the bed is comfy. I will definitely stay here again. The hotel is about a 10min walk to the main Street (Congress Ave I think). My only criticism is although the bar service was initially awesome, I think there was a changeover and I was subsequently in a service 'black hole'. I waited a good 30 mins for a beer (I ended up finding the server myself)."
4,Perfect room. Perfect bar.,"W hotels always live up to their standards, no matter where they are located.Overlooking the congress bridge, our room was the epitome of contemporary interiors.The bar was my favorite. Fireplace, a live dj mixing some eclectic lounge music, well made cocktails and chandeliers... It was perfect.The valet service was incredibly convenient too. Located very close to the Capitol building and the infamous 6th street, you cannot go wrong with this property."
4,Good location and service,Stayed there for a quick business trip. Staff was helpful and the room was nice as a true SPG hotel. The bar was a trendy and happening place. A wide variety of crowd mingle.Had breakfast next day at the hotel. The food was above average and unique enough.
5,Very Chic,"This hotel is in the heart of it all in downtown Austin. There was no need to rent a car since it is a very ""walkable"" city. It is a boutique style hotel which is very popular with the millennials. The staff members live up to the mantra ""wherever/whenever"". I highly recommend Trace, the hotel's restaurant. The food is delicious and service was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised with the reasonable cost of the meals. Venture out and explore the nearby food trucks too."
5,Another year. Another terrific stay!,"This hotel has been the one we measure all other hotels against, and so far, the other guys have come up short. My daughter and I returned to W Austin for a fourth Holiday stay. It's become something of a tradition for us. Just when you think they couldn't up their game from the previous year, the W Austin somehow accomplished it. The staff was so helpful and attentive, they made her feel like a celebrity.Leading the charge was Talent Coach, Can Kurteric. His attention and graciousness was unprecedented. There was a Merry Christmas cake in the room for my daughter on arrival, and mouse-shaped pancakes for breakfast. This on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning when his own children were at home.What can I say about the room? Amazing! You can begin to see some wear (the closet door wouldn't close and the light stayed on), but overall it was clean, well appointed and we enjoyed the openness.Someone much wiser than I said 'give your kids experiences, not things.' It's such a joy to see her learn manners, and how to treat others from the entire staff at W Austin. It's a hotel that welcomes and invites all ages. These experiences will see us back there on our next holiday."
3,Rude staff,"Beware because some of the rooms in this hotel are way smaller than others which you pay the same price . The first room they gave us was really small compared to what they state on the website. The staff is very rude specially the guest services , who didn't want to change our room after literally showing them what they market on the website and what they really give you as a room.Although the property is very beautiful and well located there are better options in Austin , I would never come back."
5,"great hotel, great team","Welcome, Wonderful, and Wired. At the W Austin, it's that and more as they exceed the standards of the brand. They do so, in no small part, thanks to the strength of their staff. The room names could easily describe them - spectacular, fabulous,fantastic - all are apropos.From the moment I arrived to the very end, every aspect of my stay was excellent. It's rare indeed when everyone you encounter, from the valet to housekeeping, is friendly and helpful and function as team, providing a sanctuary of comfort and hospitality.As an SPG Platinum I was graciously given a complimentary upgrade to a Cool Corner Suite. A special thank you to the professionals on the front line (Jordan & Leo), and especially George, who on several occasions, has taken it upon himself to ensure my stays have been perfect.The property sets a high bar for itself and consistently hits the mark. I continue to enjoy the W Austin and the genuine care and personalized service it's team provides on every level. They have made my stays memorable, and I've enjoyed a wonderful experience here by staff who makes me feel like family."
5,Wonderful hotel with great staff!!,"This hotel is the best!! Great location and the loved the atmosphere! My girlfriends and I stayed here while celebrating a bachelorette party in Austin. Marissa was so helpful!! She helped us plan everything and booked us a limo for the night with Krystal Luxuries, which couldn't have more perfect for our night of celebrating!!! We didn't have to worry about a thing. Will definitely be staying here again!!!"
5,"Modern, good location, keep going back","Well-situated, accessible to all primary downtown destinations but hidden away and in a quiet pocket. Good onsite lounges, two blocks from top running trails. Top notch staff Pleasant views (riverside)."
5,excellent customer service!,"Becky and Payal are incredible! Becky helped me book a wonderful room at a great rate, and Payal surprised me with an amazing upgrade when I checked in! My room was top notch: corner suite with a beautiful view and great amenities. I was able to relax in my room and also get some work done by the fire places in the lobby. This hotel is great :) Can't wait for my next visit!"
5,Awesome hotel and great location,"We love Starwood and make a point of staying in their hotels when we travel. We live in Austin and got married at the W Austin, and have done a ""staycation"" there as well. We have always been treated with the highest caliber of service and LOVE the hotel. It is modern, fun, funky, beautiful, with great views from some of the rooms facing the river and a great location. The pool is really fun and has some lovely cabanas for rent. Prices are not cheap but we have always received upgrades and feel the experience is worth the price."
5,Modern stay in Austin,"What can I say, its the W! This hotel was nicely appointed with modern decor and nice views of downtown Austin. The room was spacious and comfortable with a great modern feeling. The bed and pillows were perfectly balanced between soft and firm. The room layout was perfect and allowed for both work and pleasure. The hotel itself is fabulous with a great lounge, and outdoor pool. Plus, the hotel is situated in downtown near many fantastic restaurants and shops, not to mention the lake. Truly, you can't go wrong staying at this place. You know its good when there's a statue of Willie smiling at you!"
3,Overpriced hotel -- arrogants guests,"The hotel property itself is nice. Nice location. Rooms a bit small and had a weird shower -- very high barrier so not good for those who are short or physically challenged. Staff was indifferent, not rude but definitely had attitude. The guests during our two night stay really put us off this hotel. Lots of arrogant, spoiled adults and children. Poster hotel for the nouveau riche."
5,Very accommodating staff and very large bathrooms!,"Loved our stay at the W Hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. In fact I needed a MacBook charger and the concierge ran out, bought one and had it brought to my room. The rooms are nicely furnishe and the bathrooms are very spacious. The hotel itself feels hip and cool!"
5,"Great location, Fantastic customer service","The W in Austin is in a fantastic location. Walking distance to a number of fantastic restaurants - both upscale and relaxed/casual. Rooms were perfectly cleaned and well apportioned. A lot of higher end hotels can have an ""uppity"" feel, but the staff at the W provided a great balance between a higher end hotel without being pretentious.Lastly, but most importantly, FANTASTIC customer service! I hopped in a cab after checking out of the hotel and realized I forgot my iPad AFTER I got through security at the airport. I made a phone call to the hotel and was put in touch with Jay Dwyer who went to my room, found the iPad and arranged for it to be overnighted back to me. He followed up by emailing the tracking number and making sure it shipped quickly. It saved me a ton of work and worry!!I'll definitely be back when in Austin!"
4,Tim Ranow rocked it!,"Great service at the W, especially from Tim Ranow, who steered us toward a great night of music and was ready to drive us there too! Bar scene, breakfast and nearby bars and restaurants were good too."
5,Girls' Trip,"Every year I have several longtime girlfriends that spend a couple of nights at the W Austin and go to the Xmas Affair. We always stay at the W because they treat us like rock stars there! The rooms are very nice and extremely clean, the location is convenient to walk to more shopping and wonderful restaurants/bars, the drinks and snacks/appetizers in all the bars are tasty, and above all the wait staff is VERY friendly and accommodating. We always start our day with room service so we can sit in our robes in our room, and our yummy breakfast is rolled into our room on a white linened table -- such a decadent way to start our trip off right!! The W has their car service drop us off at the Long Center which is also nice to have it waiting for us when we get downstairs, and we just Uber back to the hotel when we are done, which is so close that the Uber fare is minimal -- more $$ for shopping on 2nd Street! That evening we dined at Trace and the food did not disappoint -- an after-dinner drink in the bar and one to take up to the room topped off our evening. The W is a magnificent place to spoil yourself -- just like we women do every year!"
5,W Austin is AMAZING!!!,This hotel is flawless! I travel 70% of the time for business and pleasure! The hotel CONSISTENTLY! remembers EVERY detail of my favorite needs while traveling (and that of my pets!). Caleb Campaigne is truly the BEST! HOTEL! AMBASSADOR! of any hotel (and any brand) in the world! THANK YOU W Austin for yet another exceptional stay!!!
4,Excellent but expensive,"I liked this hotel a lot on the whole but it wasn't perfect.The place is very trendy, and the bars/lounges/restaurants downstairs have a fantastic atmosphere. I particularly liked the ""listening room"" with stacks of vinyl records and a turntable; lighting is fantastic throughout the downstairs areas. However, the whole thing is a bit of a maze; good luck trying to find your way to breakfast. I'm not convinced by some of the ""semi industrial"" decor of bare concrete in some areas, but this is a matter of taste; in general the feel of the place is great.Location is great for downtown Austin.Room was clean, nicely decorated, spacious; bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was good, with a huge walk-in shower. However, the hot water took forever to arrive each morning...Wifi was a bit hit-and-miss and not that fast.On the whole recommended if you can stomach the price."
5,Great place during a Convention,"Small efficient room, completely sufficient. Wonderful folk working there, particularly Addie.I loved that I could have a couple of bottles of water and tasty apples for my day, all complimentary.And it is right next to Austin City Limits, complete with a statue of Willie."
5,Simply the best...,"I haven't reviewed this hotel (or any other, for that matter) in a while, but this particular W is really stepping up its game in the face of all the new competition in the Austin luxury boutique hotel market. I've spent 15 nights or so at this hotel over the last year and it remains my favorite W hotel brand-wide and my favorite hotel Starwood-wide too. On this particular visit, Dora at the front desk went out of her way to find the best possible room to meet my needs, Dillon at the concierge desk went out of his way to pamper my dog on my way in and schlep my luggage on my way out, and Addie at the evening front desk was a rock star as usual in sending up enough hot cocoa to last all winter and remembering specifics about me that show a level of detail and thoughtfulness that is simply world-class. This hotel is well-designed and well-located, but the exemplary service from these specific employees is where the real value lies in choosing to stay here instead of one of the many upstart boutiques sprouting like weeds around downtown Austin circa 2015.I also appreciated that the employees have been trained to distinguish between a service animal and a pet, which is one more reason why I look forward to many more great stays here in 2016."
5,Great place...very accomdative,"Great location, about a mile from campus. I was here on business. The room had a great view and the food they serve via room service was great. Overall a great stay. Michael at the from desk was very helpful on all matters."
3,"OK, but definitly not worth the price","The company I work for held an event here. I looked at the hotel online and was really excited to have the opportunity to stay here. Oh my. I was not impressed. The hotel looks chic when you walk in, very trendy and modern. However, when I got to my room....it was a bit disappointing. There was a huge stain on the carpet entry way. You could only see it if you turned the light on.The room smelled kind of gross. I discovered the hotel allows for pets and I am guessing that is where the smell and the stain came from. I am a pet lover to the max, so I can't say hotels should not offer a pet stay. It just seems maybe they need to be more cautious or make sure rooms with pets have hardwood floors rather than carpet.One great thing about the room was the shower. It was huge. Very clean, very modern. I guess I was disappointed because for the price of $400-$500 per night, I would expect it to be as nice as the JW Marriott in San Antonio. It was far from the JW.If you want to spend the kind of money this hotel costs, I would choose another place...it is not worth what it costs. I think it is worth $200/night max. If money is no problem and you want to be downtown Austin, this is great. I just was not impressed. Maybe for a younger crowd it would be awesome, I am 40...so maybe I just don't ""get it"". LOL"
5,Very courteous and responsible staff,"I stayed in the hotel on Tuesday, October 27.This was my first visit here. The next day I left in a hurry, and left my coat in the room. I did not realize this until I went back. I called the hotel and was transferred to a very nice gentleman, JB, who wasted no time in locating the coat and sending it back to me by FedEx promptly. Being a platinum member I have stayed in many different Starwood properties, and I would have to say this one right among the best I have had the pleasure to stay with."
5,Late review of a fabulous stay,"I was at the W Austin for just one night back in September and fell in love with the property. The location was perfect, right in the heart of Downtown Austin and the attention and staff beyond spectacular. I was upgraded to a cool corner room which was unexpected and very kind. Definitely will be coming back in the near future :)"
5,So luxurious!,"Felt so well taken care of at the hotel, this is what I'm talking about! Their service is outstanding and no issue is too big or too small. Interior is upscale and beautiful with clean surfaces, many cool rooms and areas to explore.I had a room on top floor with a river view. Very beautiful. Absolutely loved the bathroom (probably my favorite part of the room, to be honest). Big plus for a make-up mirror, not a biggie in general, but super nice to have. Loved that there were plenty of towels, so I never needed to ask for more. Actually, never had to ask for anything as they always remembered what I like/use. Called the reception on one occasion to ask about music I could hear into my room (nothing dramatic), was taken seriously and the next day I found chocolate chip cookies, milk, night mark, ear plugs, and a hand-written note apologizing for the inconvenience. That type of thing makes you happy!The pool was great after 4 intense days of conference. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves there, very quiet atmosphere, plenty of towels, sunbeds and refreshments to keep yourself happy.The staff was always great. I was constantly surprised by how they could remember my name at any time and shifting staff. I love when staff is attentive and greets you on the way in and out, and when you meet in the corridors.Overall, great stay! Bit pricey, but hey, they make it worth it."
5,Great service.,"Great, fun location in downtown Austin. Plenty of entertainment and good restaurants within walking distance. Next to Austin City Limits, great music venue. Customer service was very curious and professional - forgot credit card and the promptly mailed via tracking service."
5,Birthday in Austin Getaway!,"Great place! I booked this hotel at the last minute for a surprise birthday getaway (for the both of us -- our BD's are 3 days apart) in Austin. The W is close to most of the cool stuff you will find and want to do -- bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. -- in downtown Austin. Lots of stuff is within walking distance, or a short, inexpensive cab ride away. Check in was very quick and easy and the young lady who took care of us was very helpful and friendly. As I know Austin pretty well, we didn't need the concierge -- but they let us know that if we needed one, they had some good ones who were willing to help any way possible.While we didn't need help with our luggage, Joe the bellman, insisted -- which was OK -- and escorted us to our room. While in the elevator, Joe asked us what brought us to town and we said we were celebrating our birthdays. After getting to our room, we headed out to one of my favorite spots in Austin, Sholtz Garten. Upon getting back to the W, we found that Joe had provided us with a bottle of champagne and a very nice card...AWESOME!As far as the room itself, it was small (not NYC small, but on the small-ish side) but very nice and suited our needs. It's a trendy hotel, so the room was hip and trendy.The only negatives -- and they are really just minor quibbles -- is that we didn't have much of a view from our room. That's probably more on me for not asking as I'm sure they would've accommodated that request (we did ask for a room on an upper floor -- hoping for a great view of Austin -- and we got one). Also, parking is pricey and you don't have a choice other than to valet if you're in a car -- but it is what it is.All in all, we had a positive experience staying at the W Austin and plan to return and stay there on our next trip to Austin.TIP: Got the room for a great rate (less than the average rate/stated price) by booking it on a travel site and not through the official website."
5,Austin Girls Trip - Perfect Hotel!,"Stayed in Austin for a surprise birthday trip for one of our friends and this was the perfect hotel for us. Great staff, location, beautiful hotel. Have to give a SHOUT OUT to Jordan, John & Demar working the Front Desk - they were all so friendly, welcoming and helpful during our stay!One of our favorite parts of the hotel was the Living Room. It was the perfect place to hang out on the nights we didn't feel like going to 6th street. We liked it so much we only went to 6th for a few hours...and spent the rest of our time here! Great atmosphere for any kind of scene you prefer. The bouncers were awesome - SHOUT OUT to Johnny who remembered our group and greeted us each evening. Dinner at Trace was great too - delicious local food.The guest rooms were extremely luxurious and we did not feel crowded one bit. Great amenities in the rooms as well & there were robes! Can't say one bad thing about them. We were closer to the elevator and did not experience any noise disturbances.Great location too - we were able to walk to almost every destination as it is right next to countless shops, restaurants, and mini grocery stores. Can't go wrong with Starbucks right on the corner.Loved the property - we will definitely be back!! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
4,Nice Hotel in the best location,"Stayed at the W during weekend 2 of ACL and it is perfectly situated to everything we needed. The shuttle stop was a block away, restaurants and bars till you can't eat or drink anymore within a 2 block radius. In terms of convenience to outside amenities you can't beat it. Nice staff, clean, nicely appointed, great vibe, but small rooms for the price."
4,Convenient location!,"Trendy Hotel. Convenient to restaurants, coffee shops, shopping, downtown activities. Great customer service, room very comfortable, Bliss amenities. Looking forward to our next stay at the W and plan on trying the Spa."
3,Decent hotel w/ hip vibe,"The is a decent hotel. Although, i think it's rather overpriced. The room was pretty basic, with hip furniture in it. The hallways are very contemporary & industrial in feel. The bed was very comfortable. The curtains didn''t go all the way behind the pillar so light crept in the room when the sun came up. Get a room with a river view"
4,Great hotel but sterile bar compared to other W Hotels,Had business cocktails at this hotel recently. As you would expect from a W Hotel bar the decor was great and unusual in that there were thousands of vinyl record sleeves on shelves around the seating area...go figure. Whilst this worked have to say this was probably to worst W Bar I have ever been to and I have been to at least half a dozen others scattered around the world from New York to Santiago. Service was pretty indifferent if I am being honest and whilst there were quite a few other parties in the bar area the atmosphere and vibe was non existent. I wouldn't go out of my way to return that's for sure. This is just my view about the bar as I am sure the hotel delivers as a W Hotel always does.
5,Best of Austin Posh; nail all the details,"This hotel is spot on. Great location, customer service, amenities, comfort. Young hip people working there are part of the details that they cover. Pool looked awesome even though I did not have time to enjoy. Great shower and products in the bathroom, comfy bed, nailed all the details of the room. Was in Austin for work so did not discover all of what it had to offer, but seemed pretty well located in the center city and walkable to some great restaurants, and coffee shops."
3,Disappointing w trendy over rated,"Call the W the day of they only have suites available spent $1,000 for my friends and I to stay. One of the bedrooms couldn't even get cold air condition was so bad their bar it's just like a square box with lights. I've stayed at the W in Dallas la New York San Diego excetra. This was my worst it's just like one big square box going to be aw. If you're looking for a trendy hotel downtown don't spend your money here."
4,Pretty nice overall,"I was excited to stay at the W Austin on a recent business trip. Impressed with the cool interior, even though it is dark and moody. I guess that is all part of the design. LOVE the SCENT that infuses the entire hotel, even my room. It's very relaxing and such an innovative thing‚Ä¶it is very subtle, not overpowering at all. The bedrooms were very comfortable and I had a great view. Went to the spa one afternoon‚Ä¶Jeffie, the masseur, was fantastic. One of the best massages I've ever had, and I've had a few! Downers: I know the place has a young, hip vibe, but Friday night I came back about 11, and the place was rocking. Fine, except I could hear it thumping away, FOURTEEN FLOORS UP‚Ä¶really? I just turned on my sound machine, and everything was fine. Another: when I first arrived in my room, a light was out next to the vanity mirror in the bathroom‚Ä¶that should've been caught prior to my arrival. But my biggest gripe is this: the shower did not have enough water pressure even to rinse my thin hair, PLUS it never got hot‚Ä¶I HATE a tepid shower! I guess maybe the hotel thinks they conserve water and electricity/gas by lowering the pressure and the temp, but for the price I paid to stay here, I think I deserve, at the least, a good HOT shower with adequate water pressure. Other than those things, I would give it a pretty good rating."
5,Phenomenal guest service and facilities!,"The W Austin team made my boyfriend and I feel like we were extra special guests. After noting in our reservation that we were in town to celebrate a special anniversary, we were upgraded to a cool corner suite and were sent a generous welcome amenity. A special thank you to Alex L and the rest of the guest service team for making us feel like such VIPs.Prior to our arrival, the concierge team provided us with a lengthy and detailed list of attractions to check out during our time in the city which we found extremely valuable.In addition to the exemplary guest service we received, the property's facilities and amenities couldn't be more first rate. The pool area was a great urban oasis to spend down time in and was extremely relaxing. The lobby was extremely inviting and offered some great spaces to lounge around in. Finally, the property's Second Street district location couldn't have been more convenient to many of Austin's fun tourist attractions. We couldn't recommend this property more highly and would undoubtedly return for a future stay the next time we visit ATX!"
5,Best hotel we've ever stayed at after traveling all over,"This is BY FAR the best hotel my partner and I have ever stayed at from Las Vegas to London. We've stayed at all types of dive hotels to 5-star luxury and this surpasses everything. The service we received was significantly better than anywhere we've ever been. We were treated with so much respect and grace that I felt like royalty.Our room was tucked away in a corner on the 15th floor with a 3-point view of the city. It was absolutely beautiful. We could see everything. When we walked in, we were in awe. The bathroom was spacious with a beautiful shower. We had a sofa with a unique table. There was a big desk, closets, a quality iron, amazing and quick service, and helpful, fast valet. The concierge had a lot of great tips and was there late.The area is right downtown and everything is nearby. The city is at your fingertips. We walked almost everywhere. I cannot express how much we enjoyed our visit and will be SURE that the next time we are in Austin, we will stay at this hotel. A very special thanks to Jordan who provided superb service that made an immediate impression (extremely favorable).Best sleep ever. The beds are amazing. We didn't wake up a single time all through the night, which is unheard of for us. The room was immaculately clean.Thank you!"
5,Great fun hotel with excellent location,"This is a W at its best: Friendly and efficient staff, fun design, great bars and restaurants, excellent gym, great location but also business friendly with all needed functionalities. Really enjoyed a long weekend here"
4,Nice visit,"I don't normally stay at W's but my client selected the hotel for a meeting. W's have a more modern feel to them so you have to expect that going in. Also, their rooms are a little more cozy (i.e. small) than the average hotel. That said, the staff is friendly and welcoming. They have good quality bath products and a nice up-to-date bathroom. Also, this hotel had an excellent fitness room. I did not dine at the restaurant but we utilized their meeting rooms and the food supplied there was very good. My only negative was the $30+ charge for valet parking; no self parking available at this hotel."
5,Relax and enjoy,My wife and I needed some down time and her birthday was coming up. She and I booked the W hotel for a weekend and it was relaxing. The food was great especially a Trace for breakfast. We Kaye's by the pool even though we are not their normal clients for the pool we enjoyed the music and the service and people watching. We walked around the area and saw some sights and also had dinner at the local hot spots. We finished of the evening in the W living room and it was relaxing and great music as well. Stay in a room away from the elevator as the music humps in your room all night. Our only issue. But over all great.
4,Gross pool but other amenities nice,"PROS: AWAY SPA excellent massage and spa was clean and comfortable.FIT GYM: excellent equipment.Kept clean with nice view of city.Staff: Prompt valet. Welcoming check in. Great bar and restaurant service.CONS:Shower: had poor water pressure; plan to spend slot of time rinsing out shampoo if hair is shoulder length or longer.Pool: Becomes crowded with drunks and the unwashed starting around 11:00am - 6:00 pm. And they leave a film of human filth that appears to dissolve by around 8:00 am. The ""pool"" is really more like a shallow moat similar to part of an urban fountain. I was brave enough to stick my legs in during the morning and 24 hours later have not gotten ill."
5,Amazing place & staff!! I cannot get enough of place!!,This is my third time at The W hotel in Austin and it just gets better and better!! From the moment you walk in you feel like you have come to high end hotel paradise. If you can get a room with a deck its well worth it! The staff go above and beyond to make their guests happy. Michael and Jordan at the front desk and Dillon their conceriege are AMAZING!!! I was in need of hair services and it was late at night and of course Dillon found me a fabulous place that could take care of me at 9:00 at night. They always have a smile on their face and ready to make your every request possible. Thanks for always making my stay wonderful and for your love of fried pickles!! I will be back soon!!
3,"Just an average ""Spectacular"" room","I booked this hotel with a pre-paid rate for the ""Spectacular"" room category for a Saturday night. Upon check-in, staff George was super nice yet professional, and chatted us up. He confirmed my reservation, and gave us our room key, bottled water & other materials (see pic). Because I had booked directly via SPG and selected the ""Spectacular"" room (and paid for it), I was expecting a ""spectacular"" room (room 1522). Instead, I got what I felt was just their ""cozy"" or ""wonderful"" room. The room was just an ordinary room- ok bed, TV, & desk; the shower was large, but barely any water pressure; nice to have a water closet; sink was nice, but sink area/vanity was pretty small. It could have been my expectations were raised due to their description of the room, but I was totally disappointed. My husband remarked the room was not worth the price that I paid, and I agreed with him.I didn't raise a fuss, as we had our event to get to, but it would have been nice to actually get the kind of room I paid for. And no, the check out staff the next morning did not ask how my stay was, nor did he say anything else other than ""Thanks"" when I dropped off the room keys. Yes, I realize I should have spoken with a manager to voice my skepticism of the room, and if I had stayed more than one night, I would have.So, here are the pros & cons, based on my 1-night Saturday stay:*Pros:-great location next to the Moody Theater-good valet service (even though busy)-interesting bar rooms-friendly check-in staff-friendly & competent bar staff-nice bathroom area*Cons:-didn't feel my room matched the description of room I pre-paid for-lobby is a little too dark-chargers by bedside were not working-small vanity area-low water pressure in showerOverall, more of a positive stay rather than negative, but definitely not worth the price."
5,"Great Hip Hotel, Great Location",Have stayed there several times. If you can get bumped up the suites are terrific. A groovy W. On the newer side. Great Bar. Great location. Attached to ACL. Be back in your room after a concert in 5 minutes. Easy walk to a lot of fun stuff. My only beef is it is often very expensive to stay. But most hotels in Austin are because of the lack of Hotel rooms. Although that is changing. You have to like W's- music playing throughout and a big night scene. And I heard the Gym is awesome.
3,Party hotel,"Just beware that this hotel's target are not families; it's all about the hip. The pool on the weekends turns into a local pickup joint (DJ included) and the hotel even suggests that families may not want to participate. To their credit they even offered us rides to Barton Springs instead.The lobby bar on the weekends is less then welcoming; velvet rope and bouncers... Inside the lobby. A bit weird.The rest ok, but not up to the hype. The staff were friendly and nice.Picture is of the pool on a Saturday around 4 pm."
5,Great experience!,"I've been going to the W Hotel for years now with family and friends and always had good experiences at the bar, the restaurant, and the spa. Recently, we spent a day at the pool and we had a great time. Kelsey Rae was so welcoming, helpful, and it was obvious that she enjoys what she does and takes it very seriously. We always went back just because it's the W, but now we will go back to the pool because Kelsey is there!"
2,"Arrogant staff, unwelcoming vibe.","Room was nice, but I didn't enjoy my stay at this hotel. Overall the staff was just so arrogant...especially all of the front desk staff. Just because you work at the w doesn't mean you should snub your guests. Totally forgettable and peopled by morons, the guests weren't much nicer. How could you point to guests as a criticism for a hotel? Go to a w and hang out in the lobby...you're in for an interesting round of people watching. I'm a millennial, but that doesn't mean I don't know what good service is. You're a hotel...make me welcomed and appreciated. Never felt that at all...they were doing me a favor by allowing a pleb like me stay to partake in this shrine erected in honor of vanity and self-importance."
5,Loved this Hotel,This was a surprise visit as we were suppose to fly to Ashville NC instead. As soon as we walked in and I saw the lobby I knew it was a great choice. We immediately went up to Wet Bar until our rooms were ready and people watched. The rooms themselves were laid out perfect and we loved the views. The location could not have been better! The bar was happening at night too.
5,Best in Austin,"I stayed at this location for a staycation/anniversary and I have to say it was absolutely great stay. When I made the reservation with Alex at the front desk, and he told me that he was going to make sure we had a good time, I wasn't expecting for him to go above and beyond. From the attention we received at check in,the chocolate covered strawberries and that beautiful view of Austin from the room made the night extra special for my wife and I. It didn't stop there. The staff were very friendly and caring, always ready to serve and assist we every need we had.Alex, thank you so much for taking care of us."
2,Nickle and dime on a much larger scale,"So disappointing. I had been in Austin all week for business and my husband flew in for the weekend, so we decided to stay at the W when he arrived. We asked for an early check in but didn't get our room until 3 pm. We were allowed to go up to the pool area and wait, so we went to the poolside bar, which was pretty cool. Had an expensive mojito that was just ok. Asked about renting the chairs in a gazebo private area and found out they were 150 for the small 2 person gazebo and 350 for the larger. Crazy, just for a lounge chair by the pool. So we left and went walking around the neighborhood, which is nice. Finally got a call at 3 that out room was ready. It was a corner room but small. A bit dingy and we weren't facing the river, even though I paid for a river view. The small 1/2 can of Pringles for sale above the minibar was $7. A small can of oxygen was $17. Not sure what that was about. Absurd. Put a sour taste in my mouth for all Ws. I used to love the one in NYC at Union square, but this one had a trashy, non- classy, techno music playing feel to it AND it was way overpriced for what we got. Next time will just stay at the Hyatt. Was so much better in every way."
4,Nice hotel in great location,"We enjoyed our stay at the W. The staff was friendly and professional. The location is perfect in Austin ‚Äì it is walking distance from quite a lot, including Sixth Street and the Congress Street bridge (to watch the bats). The rooms are decorated with a modern flare. The only knock on the rooms is the shower area is open to the rest of the room. The hotel will bring up a curtain if you ask, but if you trust your traveling companion not to look, they can‚Äôt see you if they stay around the corner in the bed.The hotel is decidedly not family friendly ‚Äì though this tends to be true for the W brand as we have stayed in others and had the same opinion. We did bring our teenagers and it is probably okay for that age, but the clientele tends to be a little raucous ‚Äì at least it was the weekend we stayed. The scene at the pool was definitely the place to see and be seen, but not for a family. We were warned of this at check-in and they offered the hotel car to take us to Barton Springs, should we want to have time at a pool. This was a very nice touch."
5,One of the best hotels I've stayed at,"A very nice hotel - the rooms are large, modern and very comfortable. Service is very friendly and charming. Internet is fast and beds comfortable. Very well located right in downtown Austin, within a walking distance from a lot of restaurants, cafes and music venues. Breakfast is great - I definitely recommend both the Market Omelette as well as the amazing Eggs Benedict. It is definitely my preferred hotel for any future visits to Austin."
5,Must stay - service beyond measure,"In Austin for a work conference and could not have asked for better service or experience. Everyone from the front desk, concierge, valet, rooftop pool, restaurant staff, and housekeeping teams were outstanding. Some of the most memorable - housekeeping: after expressing how much I appreciated the chocolates with turndown service, I received a box of their chocolates the next day. Pool: the white concrete around the pool area is deceivingly hot and walking barefoot I found myself hopping back to my lounge area. One of the pool staff ran over a pair of flipflops over to me so I could walk the rest of the way back in comfort. Restaurant: waiter was outstanding with hospitality, service, attentiveness, and was lovely to speak with."
5,"Fantastic stay, Fantastic city","Well, the W can't be responsible for both of these claims, but they sure are the reason for the fantastic stay! Superb hotel (why would you expect anything less from The W?!), the service was impeccable, hotel upkeep was amazing and, perhaps, the single nicest gym I've ever used at a hotel! We're talking at the caliber of what you'd expect from a dedicated gym.I'll add, though I was there on business, the hotel bar (or, rather, labyrinth of bar ""rooms"") was exceptional and is a place I could imagine lounging in for hours. They had a DJ on Wed night but not the sort of obnoxious type, it was really soft played house/trans type music that worked perfectly.My only complaints are around the pool/spa situation. The pool is a sort of lap ""strip"", not the type to lounge in, and, unless I missed it, I couldn't find an outdoor hot tub to soak in.But easy call, 5 stars, truly excellent!"
4,A Great W in a Great City,Spent my bday weekend here and this hotel + SPG stepped up with a terrific room upgrade plus desserts delivered to room both days. Very much appreciated. The W brand can be very hit and miss but I liked this one a lot. Lots of exposed concrete countered by nice modern decor and furnishings with Texas touches. Several really nice and comfortable living room areas off the lobby that were lively but not off putting. All sorts of fun things within walking distance in every direction. Concierge was a great help and pointed me to several happening neighborhoods.
5,Ask For Marian!!,"I'm a frequent guest here. About once a month. I've gotten to know a lot of the staff there, but there is one staff member that has really stood out and goes above and beyond for me when I stay here. Ms. Marian Lopez works in the office. You will probably never see her but if you call, I would recommend you ask for her. She a very sweet and kind person that makes staying and nice hotels like the W worth it. Thank You Marian! I'll be back soon."
5,FAB!!,I'm a long time fan of the W brand and this hotel exceeded all expectations.Great service. As an SPG lifetime Platinum member I was upgraded to a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite. VERY NICE. Beds are exceptional comfortable and the decor is funky and eclectic and had some nice local touches.Will definitely stay again next time in Austin
4,Very hip - which I am not,"I loved my suite - huge and well appointed. The hotel was full of young attractive and energetic people. The lobby is full of small intimate rooms to drink in. The vibe is dark and like a nice den with dance music. The staff are smart and friendly. It was a good experience, even if I felt a bit out of place."
5,Hometown get away,"We are locals but wanted to do something special to celebrate our anniversary; and, we decided on a get away to the W. It was a fabulous way to commemorate our 31st.. The hotel is beautiful and the restaurant was outstanding. The pool was a ""happenin'"" and fun place to hang. But, the people are authentically on a mission to make sure your stay is perfect. They were wonderful. Cannot tell you how many times they greeted us by saying Happy Anniversary. Made us happy. BTW, they upgraded us to a room that had the best view of Lady Bird Lake that I have ever had before. So fun.."
5,Great stay as always,"Great service, great decor and great atmosphere.Room was spacious and comfortable. We liked the shower, bathroom and amenities. Bed was very plush.Pool looked great but we did not have time to use it. View from our room was of the lake and amazing.We were there for a weekend and the hotel was pretty busy, so I'm thinking that's something to expect on a regular basis. The location is perfect, walking distance to all the fun, so no wonder everyone wants to stay there!"
5,fun weekend in austin,"we really like the W hotels, but weren't sure about the type of atmosphere/level of service at the Austin location. what a nice surprise that every single employee, from the cleaning staff, to Leo Rossini who checked us in, to the car hops and bell staff, were super helpful and friendly. none of that faux snobbery. it was a great place to relax, have fun and enjoy a great room, pool, and location."
5,Exceptional Service,"I stay at the W Austin weekly for work. The customer service day in and day out face-to-face and over the phone is exceptional. I recently had an issue with my folio that I needed to expense for work. The customer service team I spoke with (Leo Rossini and Dora Kucinic) quickly worked together to get my issue resolved and everything corrected. They both assured me that if I ever had an issue again I could reach out to them personally. As a customer, the individual attention and importance placed on my inquiries, as well as the timely response and resolution is invaluable."
5,W must be short for WOW!,"My wife and I decided to take a trip to Austin to join our son as he and his brothers and sister-in-law celebrated his birthday. We have never vacationed in Austin nor have we ever stayed at a W hotel before. Let me start off by saying that I've stayed in many hotels for business trips throughout my career, but I've never experienced a hotel stay quite like this one. The staff made you feel like they knew you personally like a long lost friend. Check-in was smooth, as was the glass of champagne that was poured for us as we checked-in. Our room was great. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a large separate shower instead of a tub/shower combo. The view was awesome as we had a view of the river. We arrived on a Friday afternoon and were interested in finding a place close by where we could get a light snack and some cocktails. David, the concierge, gave us directions to a great restaurant/bar within walking distance. It was exactly what we wanted. Upon our return, we decided to spend some time in the Living Room Bar. We met two amazing staff members, Andrea, who works in the bar and Sloan, who is in the security department. Both of them were extremely friendly and they made sure our stay was relaxing and enjoyable. David set us up with W's ""Go Car"" for our transportation to the restaurant. Joe, our driver, was very friendly and got us to the restaurant on time. The ""Go Car"" isn't a 24 hour operation so we used Lyft (it's like Uber) to get back to W. The next day, David hooked us up with another great place to eat breakfast that was within walking distance from the hotel. After breakfast, we checked out of our room, but checked our bags in and hung out at the pool all day before we departed. The pool is fantastic. It had a bit of a Las Vegas vibe going on...music, drinks, people having a good time...it was a great way to just unwind and forget about everything else going on in the world for awhile. In my opinion, you can't beat the W. We will be back!"
5,Great hotel & wonderful stay,"Had the pleasure of staying at the W Austin for 4 nights for my birthday. The staff was great and very welcoming, I was upgraded and used the ""keyless"" feature when I arrived and had no problems getting into my room. I got a massage on my birthday at the Away Spa and it was amazing, they even gave me a free ""add on"" for my birthday. The Splash pool was nice but usually crowded and there was a live DJ. I love this hotel and definitely recommend it and will absolutely stay here again."
5,Best staff,"Good location, great staff. I have parked at City Hall (electric charger overnight) and literally could walk to many places like Congress and even 6th street. Lots of other nice hotels nearby, but W beats them all. Austin Java coffee shop for a full Austin experience across the street."
5,Great Day at W Austin,"I was looking forward to a date night with my wife in Downtown Austin. Decided on the W Austin as they have the connection to the music and dining scene in Austin. We found the car valet, reservation staff, and ""insider"" to be ultra helpful, in giving us good recommendation options for a late lunch, SoCo shopping, drinks, and a live music venue. The property, social rooms, and guestroom was really great. Loved the DJ and drinks selection in the Livingroom. Great vibe all-around. The bed was awesome, so ""bedtime"" was memorable. Our stay at the W Austin was the best!"
5,Princess treatment,"I truly loved this property. It was everything a W should be. Aside from gorgeous decor, I met a great deal of amazing talent.My first interactions were with Dillion and Brett. Their insider was busy when I needed advice on a great happy hour and cheese board , but Dillion was more than willing to assist me in my search. The two of them convinced me to visit the living room bar, which turned out to be my best decision of the night.That's where I met Dane, who took great care of me and my friends. He provides fabulous service with a smile. His manager, Dante, took the time to talk to us and made me understand just why the service here is so amazing--they truly seem to enjoy their jobs and that is passed on to the guest.I also MUST mention Tim who offered to assist us with transportation. Although we didn't need any, he helped us find a great place within walking distance to get a cheese board. Not only did he suggest a place, he called to make sure they had the board on their menu, and then proceeded to walk us to the end of the block to give us directions. Now that is above and beyond.If I ever find myself in Austin again I will definitely stay at this property. My time was truly memorable, thank you!"
2,Not great,Staff is very friendly. The hotel needs some updating. The rooms feel like I'm playing Barbie doll . They are plastic and not a good vibe. Bathroom is open concept. Come on. Products are no name and don't seem to be good quality. Restaurant prices expensive and don't appear to be high quality
5,Great Stay !,"From the moment we all checked in the bellman to the security personal all the hotel staff were a great pleasure to deal with , the hotel and suite rooms were so nice the bed I wanted to find a way to take home with me, the next time in Austin this is the place to be the place to stay very close to everything there ! Thanks for the greZt comfortable stay"
5,Such a fun time,"From the moment Dillon checked us in until our final drinks at the bar served by Eric we had an amazing time. Both of those guys made our stay very relaxing and amazing. The hotel was terrific, great room, and beautiful view of downtown Austin. The hotel atmosphere, service and bar were top notch, however the food was unexpectedly not great but not a deal breaker. I had the spaghetti and it tasted like it had been taken out of a microwave. With that being said if your looking for a good time in the heart of downtown Austin with everything walking distance then this is where you want to stay. See you soon W"
5,great hotel,headed home for a funeral and choice this hotel. have stayed at many austin hotels and will have to say was really impressed. great location and nice views and very comfortable rooms and beds are very comfortable. nice outside sitting area for relaxing and drinks.a must stay
4,The W in Austin,"The best part about this hotel was the fun Pool scene! A place for great people watching and socializing! We were greeted by Addie at the front desk when we arrived early, and she gladly gave us our room-after she asked if we would be ok with the top floor-16th floor- overlooking the pool and downtown! A very classy room and cozy bed and AC. The bar/restaurant downstairs was a bit of a maze, but the atmosphere was fun."
5,Best Trip Ever!,"Best vacation for the 4th of July weekend was at the W hotel in Austin. David the concierge did a magnificent job in assisting me with planning my trip ahead of time. Addie not only gave me a warm welcome making me feel at home but also completed check in process within a timely manner. Alex is the individual who really made a difference in ensuring my satisfaction. No matter what request I threw his way, he never failed to make it happen! He made sure my stay exceeded every expectation I had."
4,4 awesome days in Austin!,"My husband and I stayed at the W for our 3 year wedding anniversary! We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries in our room! The location was perfectly located downtown and walking distance to all the hot spots. Our room was nice, but there was little room for storage. We basically lived out of our suitcase for 4 days because there was no drawers for our clothes. The bathroom was very small and no counter space for our things. Overall, it was a nice hotel, but expected more from the W Hotel! The service was excellent!"
4,Perfect location,"Austin W is pretty well located, close enough to the sixth street madness, but also far away enough if you need a good night sleep. The pool is nice there, and Trance is a must try restaurant. Room is decent size and clean, a little bit rundown. Staffs are pretty friendly and helpful."
4,nice hotel / nice staff / please clean the pool......,"stayed at the W Austin during a recent 'buddies' trip to Austin for BBQ, golf and to generally see Austin.the W Austin is one of those 'chic' hotels which I think more caters to the 20/30 something crowd, our group is more the later 30's and all in all really liked the W Austin.the staff were excellent, the lobby bar was nice and most people that stay at the W Austin I would say but not assume like to party, we fit kind of right in the middle there as to our group.couple things that I really want to note is the rooms while they are very modern and nice, there are no drawers and only a small place to hang your clothes so for 3 nights I basically lived out of my suitcase / bag.the pool, where do I start, we were on the 8th floor facing the pool and at times I could barely see the bottom of the pool due to the murkiness, sure the talent was there, 6-pack abs, bikinis but not a chance I was going in that pool so the only note to the staff, please 'shock' the pool, more chlorine, 'something'.all in all I would have no problem in staying at the W Austin again but might opt for a more 30/40 crowd with a cleaner pool but really the pool and the lack of drawers was the only negative I could find is not too bad.lots of great things to do in Austin so do your homework and enjoy the great City of Austin.I still hold to the 4 star rating, thank you"
5,Definitely a TOP place to stay in Austin,"Highest level of service, Cool room. Great location for anything in Austin, especially ACL events! Trace's service and food is also excellent. W Austin is first class... from the people like Jeff, to one of the best hotel gyms I have seen, to the pool! All made the weekend in Austin that much more enjoyable! Thank you"
4,Awesome View,"I've stayed in many W Hotels throughout the US. This one is pretty new and extremely nice. The staff was fine. Lobby pretty cool. Was hoping for a bit of an upgrade in room size. But, I guess the view was the upgrade. It was great! Overlooking the river. The bed was very comfortable. Like the huge shower. Always a fan of Bliss bath products. But, my favorite aspects of the room were the blue drinking glasses and black and white photos of Willie Nelson. We did not try the hotel restaurant but did take a peak. It was posh. I loved the hotel pool. Very relaxing and pleasant. The location was great as we walked all around downtown Austin. We did eat at the Salt Lick bbq place just out of town and a wonderful modern Mexican place downtown called Manuel's. I would stay at the W Austin again but would need some better rates as my company paid for this stay."
4,"High Expectations, W Austin almost met them.","Reserved a beautiful balcony room for the July 4th fireworks display over the water. The king bed and overall space in the room was very nice, I liked the Bliss brand toiletries. I did have a couple of negative experiences with the front desk staff (incorrectly reprogrammed keys, overall wait times were long, etc) however the overall interactions with the staff on this property were good.A few potential improvements and caveats:**The decor on the balcony and the red couch inside the room... the furniture was way cheap looking and feeling.**The room's A/C simply never kept up - it was always warm in the room.**The hotels took FOREVER - both ways, all times of the day.**If you're looking for a room with a view, the best you'll get is some green hill country surburbia mix in the distance - no view of the river from the balcony floor (6th floor) but you do get a pool view if you lean over. The fireworks were blocked, as there is a new building going up right in front of where the fireworks were going off.**No bathtubs/jacuzzi - isn't this expected in a nice room these days?**Looking for better service by front desk staff- some hipster kid at the front desk messed up my key and I had to go down 3 times to get my key reprogrammed correctly (thanks for fixing Ben) before I checked out on Sunday.Overall, if you're staying in Austin to have a romantic getaway or for an anniversary, this hotel is modern, fun, and close enough to the main Austin destinations. I know there are better values out there due to the expense of the room and parking ($1100 for 2 nights including parking taxes and fees) but I hope this helps you decide."
5,Great stay!,"We had a great weekend experience at the W Austin, Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Room nice and comfortable. Upgraded our room because it was our 1st anniversary. The gym is the nicest hotel gym I have ever seen, We will definitely come back."
5,Great Customer Service!,"My husband and I recently made a brief stop at this hotel while on business. The staff was very nice and the accommodations were great! Also the location is close to many restaurants. In the haste of leaving our hotel for our next destination, we left behind a few important items that could not be replaced. My husband contacted the hotel, and they could not be any more helpful and accommodating. Mr. Ramsey Tabor immediately over nighted the items to our next destination! We were most grateful!!"
5,The W Austin wrules!,"My GF and I have been traveling together for 3 years, and the W Austin is our favorite hotel thus far. The staff is beyond courteous and friendly and helpful. We travel with a small dog and they helped set up a dog walker/sitter for when we wanted to go out alone for a few hours at night. We have had zero problems with having the dog here; one night the sitter wasn't available and the manager, Dave, hung out with the dog in his office for two hours without payment. How many hotel managers would do that?We avoided the pool, which is more of a trendy bar/meeting place, but used the ample workout equipment in the gym daily. Had the place almost to ourselves. And the room was spacious and clean, with all the amenities other than HBO (that would have been nice BTW, if anyone from the W is reading this).Great location, too, about a 15-minute drive from the airport. The W is within walking distance of 6th street, SoCo, and about 50 great bars and restaurants, as well as Lady Bird Lake. We took a tour of Austin as well so we pretty much got to see the whole city, which we loved as well.Definite 5 stars for the W Austin, highly recommend, especially if you're traveling with a pet."
4,"Good stay, typical of the W brand","Enjoyed this hotel. Great location. If you have stayed at a W, this is a very typical hotel for this brand. I happen to like the modern d√©cor and clean lines of the W brand. The bar was good, but pricey. The pool is smaller than most, but stylish. Liked that it was a salt water pool. Wish the pool had later hours. Did not get to enjoy it because I was there for work and only got to take a quick dip after work."
5,Fantastic hotel,"I'm a big fan of W hotels. The beds are the most comfortable I've found, the rooms are modern and the overall ambiance is hip and trendy. My only complain would be the over priced breakfast via room service."
5,W Rocks,"My wife and I stayed at the W Austin just for one night. However, we were treated like royalty by all staff. It was also my wife's birthday and they upgraded our room, brought in a cheesecake and acknowledged her (and I) for our entire stay. The staff was all awesome and welcoming!!WE will be back for sure!"
5,This is what being a W is all about,"I like Starwood Hotels and W is my favorite brand but not all of them do the brand justice (I'm looking at you, W New Orleans French Quarter/ W Chicago Lakeshore).The W Austin is simply fantastic.Great food, awesome staff, the flexible ""can do"" attitude you expect from a W as well as modern, clean, well designed rooms. Pool parties on Sundays are epic.I'm here again right now and this time I'm not at the W because I need to be in Austin - I'm in Austin because I wanted to be at this W (and go for some BBQ) :)"
5,Great Place,"I stayed here 4 nights for a business conference we had on-site and couldn't be happier. Staff was friendly and super helpful. Fitness center was the best I have ever seen in any hotel and I travel extensively. The property and room was modern and stylish, and the location was terrific, easy walking distance to many of the best restaurants and bars in the city."
5,Great Stay at a Great Place,"The W Austin is incredible - like all W properties I've visited. We stayed in 2014. The Library bar is wonderful as is the outside bar. The rooms are great, too. The hotel is situated in downtown Austin making it easy to get anywhere. I recommend a stay if you're planning a trip to Austin!"
5,"Great location, great staff, just great","This location is very convenient to anywhere in downtown Austin. The staff is very friendly and very customer oriented. It has similar 'vibes' to other W Hotels. Very nice bar area. Rooms are very modern and clean. My only complaint (& it's very surprising) is the wifi was poor. In a city as techie as Austin, I found it hard to believe. Great stay though."
5,Fun,"The most contemporary Hotel I've ever stayed. The architecture and design is key, and the lighting systems are the focal points. The ""Marvelous Room"" is the finest at the W; and looking over the lake was the best view I've experienced in Austin."
4,"Super Convenient, Caring Staff","We attended an event at ACL live. The W Austin couldn't be more conveniently located. It was a great spot for dinner before the event and cocktails afterward. The service in the hotel couldn't have been friendlier and more accommodating. Check in was smooth. We were upgraded to a larger ""wonderful"" room on a higher floor and located further from the elevator. The room was clean and comfortable. Personally, I thought the sheets were a bit old and had started to fray and pill, but my wife had no problem with them. After hour meal service was quick and delicious. Air conditioning was working perfectly. The wake up call came on time, the car was brought up on time, check out was a snap. All in all, the hotel was everything you should expect at that price point and we were treated very well by the staff. We read some reviews about noise in the hotel but this wasn't our experience. With its location downtown adjacent to everything you would want to do, it was exactly what we wanted. Will be pleased to stay again."
5,"W Austin - For Comfort, For Business, For Leisure - Best Hotel in Austin","For the last four months I have been staying in the W Austin on Mondays - Thursdays, and some weekends. This place has been more or less my home and I can't speak enough about how comfortable it has been. The staff is, as a whole, the most consistent and attentive staff I have encountered at any hotel in my past two years (staying 230+ nights in hotels each year).I am typically a business traveler, and the below references will let you know why I think this is the best place for travel regardless of the trip being business or pleasure.On weekends the W is the place to be, on many Saturday nights it is not even worth venturing into Austin because the bar downstairs is the liveliest scene in town. The craziest thing to me, is regardless of that level of noise/partying, the rooms are still quiet and comfortable for the people that want to be tucked in before midnight.The entire experience is really something to speak for - although the parking can get backed up in the entrance drive during peak hours (where can't?) the valet drivers and staff greet you and welcome every guest (Xion is the man). They make sure that the guest has their needs addressed (water, luggage assistance, etc.). Dillon, Brad, and Mike are the three desk attendants that I encounter most frequently and they are extraordinary at what they do. If you are here for more than a one night stay you are certain to see these guys and don't be surprised if they ensure that you have everything you need. Moreover, it doesn't matter who is working when you arrive, each one is bound to treat you greatly and I have no bad things to say about any of the employees I have encountered up front.Will and Brandon (bellmen) are spectacular - at check-in and check-out they get your bags up to the room and they show up very fast to get them brought back down. The best part about the bell staff is no matter who serves you they are all on their top game.When you need a good recommendation to buy a shirt, to grab a bite, or to grab a drink, the concierge team is phenomenal. I don't use this team enough, but they've gotten packages shipped for me, personally.Overall there is no more dynamic hotel in Austin and it rates at the top of each of the categories I would measure a hotel by."
5,Well Run Hotel,The W Hotel Austin is a very well run and comfortable downtown hotel. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. Being a member of SPG I was able to use their new keyless entry system to get into my room. I used my iPhone as a mobile key and boy was it great. I constantly leave the old traditional gust room key cards in the room and have to go to the front desk to get new cards. Now with the mobile key I don't lose the key. The mobile key also worked in the elevator to access my floor.
5,Fairly standard W fare-- excellent restaurant (Trace) and spa (Away) were the high points.,"Was here 3 nights for a conference. I was upgraded as an SPG Platinum to a Cool Corner Suite, which was very large, well appointed, and overlooked the pool and the city. In the room, I really appreciated the built in charger by the bed (for seemingly all devices) and the large soaking tub, which unlike most, filled up in like 2 minutes flat. I had room service a few times..would say that Trace restaurant is better than the limited room service menu, which was fine for things like salads (the Cobb and Caesar were good, if unremarkable). I appreciated the 24 hour doorman always present to open the giant front door. Was bummed I didn't know they had the SPG keyless entry before I checked in. Will definitely do that next time!"
5,One of the best places to stay in Austin,"Love staying here as its in the heart of everything you need in Austin. Great location and excellent service across the board. It does get pricey around SXSW and ACL, but because of the experience there, I alway make the effort to stay there. Only wish the pool was much bigger which seems to be the only miss."
4,Chic and Cozy,"The room was extremely stylish and the bed was firm, yet so comfortable. The view was nothing special...I was on the sixth floor, so no biggie. The biggest asset the hotel has is its staff. They were friendly, only slightly aloof. The pool area was fun and their Rio Grande cocktail was sooo refreshing! I would stay here again! Lots of fun if you're young or young-at-heart!"
1,Not good - does it deserve the 'W' ?,"This is not up to the W brand standard. Everything about the place is slapdash and devil may care which flies in the face of the attention to detail that the chain prides itself on. Not sure if the stellar reviews have come from people who haven't stayed at other W properties but a word of caution to those that have, W Austin is not what you're after."
5,Amazing experience,"The W Hotel is hands down my favorite hotel brand. If possible I would stay at their hotel in every city I visit! I love W hotels because you know they are going to have optimal locations, incredible decorations, great music, and good food.The W Austin is no different than the reputation I mentioned above. The hotel is located right off of Lady Bird Lake in the heart of downtown. The rooms are modern but still have an Austin feel to them, and the food is incredible!Hotel Property:From the moment you walk into the lobby you know you are going to have a great experience. When you look around you will notice how open everything feels with the concierge sitting at a big table with a laptop. The lobby is decorated with modern furniture and a has pretty incredible succulent garden along all the walls. There is also always great music playing to get you in a good mood. The lobby alone gets me excited for stay here.Hotel Rooms:As I mentioned above the hotel rooms are modern but still have an Austin feel. We were fortunate enough this time to get a corner suite. Although we got lucky and ended up with a pretty big room, all of the rooms are fairly spacious. I have stayed at this hotel at least 5 times and each time I‚Äôm always impressed with the room. My personal favorite part of the room is the Bliss toiletries‚ÄîI love the fresh lemon scent.I feel like in my reviews I always talk about the beds‚Äîbut beds are really important to me! I don‚Äôt know what it is about nice hotels and their comfy beds but I‚Äôm always really impressed! The W‚Äôs beds were great and I had very restful sleep every night.Lastly, I just loved the look and feel of the room. The rooms are mainly white and gray with red and blue accents. The rooms have a clean and modern feel but are also very inviting!Pro-tip: if you‚Äôre not a late night person try staying on the Northern end of the hotel. Austin is known as the ‚Äúlive music capital‚Äù of the world and the W is no exception. Since there is a music venue attached to the W sometimes it can get a little loud on the South side, so just be sure you‚Äôre aware of this when planning your stay.AWAY SpaDuring our stay at the W Hotel we had the chance to get couples massages at their AWAY Spa. The treatment was incredible and I highly recommended it to anyone looking for a good massage. The AWAY Spa is beautiful‚Äîfitting the modern theme of the entire hotel. When you arrive you are taken to the locker and waiting room. You are given a robe and slippers and then wait in their waiting room for your therapist.My husband went with the Deep Tissue massage and I had a Swedish massage. I really enjoyed my treatment, as did my husband. My therapist kept the bed warmer on for me and used warm towels throughout the whole treatment. I really appreciated this because I always get really cold during my massages. She was great at asking me if the pressure was comfortable and also got out all the knots that were bothering me without making it an painful experience.At the end of our treatments we were given the option to use the steam rooms and take a steam shower. Both the male and female locker rooms have the showers and they are great! I was feeling a little congested for a couple of days prior to the message and after the steam room I was completely clear! It was really wonderful!WETWET is what they call the pool. The pool is beautiful and not only has chairs but also VIP areas with T.V.‚Äôs, fridges, and lounge furniture that you can reserve. WET also has a bar where you can order drinks and food to make your pool experience even better. They have great pool parties on Sundays that are fun to attend, where they typically have a live DJ.FITThe W has a wonderful gym that I really enjoyed using. They have all the standard workout equipment you would expect and hope to find in a gym along with a large fitness room where you can practice yoga, pilates, or other aerobic exercises. I personally loved that they had a barre so that I could still get my barre routine in."
5,Thank Goodness for the W,"After having a reservation at another hotel made incorrectly and all their rooms booked up I spent 2.5 hours trying to find another hotel in Austin with no luck. Fortunately my assistant was able to grab the last room at the W. As I walked in at 12:30 am worn down from my (mis)adventure the staff was wonderful as they knew what I had been through that evening. They were kind enough to give me a free drink coupon which I needed! The rooms are fairly decent size and very well appointed. I had a great view of the river. As you would expect from the W hotels this place had a very hip vibe to it. The costs are quite high but everywhere in Austin is crazy expensive these days. I have stayed at a number of hotels downtown and this is definitely one of, if not the nicest, especially for the younger crowd.Thanks again to the manager on duty last night."
3,Average Hotel with 5 Star Price,"I'm not so sure what all the hype is about this place. I have stayed in several other W locations and this one just missed the mark.Location:Although I have to say Uber makes things in Austin so much more accessible the W isn't exactly in the ""middle of it all"" but still in a good area with several good restaurants around for a quick bite or drink. Quick trip to and from airport. I would say, no traffic expect 10-15 minutesCheck-In:This is my first gripe, at least 15 people standing in line, 1 person checking people in. All of which rooms were quite ready which is understandable since we were there before check-in. They did call me once my room was ready but could not locate my luggage and had to bring it up for me at a later time. Weird I know.Room:I had a room overlooking the pool that looked nice. The layout of the room was fine but I found it weird to have a yellow 6 plug construction gauge extension cord as my outlet next to my bed. The air conditioner never made it to the desired temp which can be an issue in Austin. The room also did not have any drawers to put cloths or other items away. For the price paid for this room I feel none of that should be an issue.Staff:Never experience the ""great"" service talked about by others in other reviews. When I think ""5 Star"" service this was a 2. Not because the service was bad but because nothing was done to make it a wow experience a ""5 Star"" deserves.Conference Space and Food:I have to say this was done very well. The space was great, the food was great, and the audio visual was spot on. They nailed it on this aspect.Bar:I would say better than average hotel bar but the service was a bit lacking. Plenty of people working behind the bar but getting a drink wasn't that easy as it looked like they were short staffed.Overall ExperienceCame away wanting more for the price paid. It felt more like your typical chain hotel with a conference center. I feel if you are going to ask a ""5 Star"" price you must have ""5 Star"" service and room accommodations. This had neither."
5,Our favorite W property,This is our favorite W hotel of the entire W collection. The service here is top notch from the moment you arrive. The location is perfect for exploring downtown. We can't wait for our next trip back to the W Austin!
5,W is for WOW!!!,"The staff at the W and especially their valet team went above and beyond to make our stay extra special! From the moment you walk in you know you are going to get exactly what you have been looking for at a high end hotel. I mentioned at the front desk I was thirsty the next thing I knew I was being handing a drink. The front desk staff are all A players!! Great recommendations!! The rooms are very modern and trendy as well as a touch of cozy. I was there for business and on the day of a software demo my boss decides he wants to have the meeting by the pool instead of the business center. However, I did not have my laptop. I asked the conceriege twice if she could help me with a laptop and she said there was no way they could provide one even for just a couple of hours. Then the valet team came to my resuce and contacted the IT department and voila! I had a loaner laptop for the meeting. It was a very successfull meeting and the deal was sealed! I cannot thank them enough for helping me. I cannot wait to come back in a few weeks:))"
5,Awesome hotel,Came for a golf trip with friends. Awesome hotel and great lobby bar at night. Left a phone charger behind and Sloan from the hotel couriered it to me - awesome service. Very lively pool scene too. Will certainly come back if I can.
5,Great hotel,"This is the second time that I have stayed at the W. It really is a great hotel. The location firstly is fantastic, so close to good restaurants and downtown features. Secondly the staff are fantastic from the 'wheels' car team through to the excellent concierge Dave Dart (who found us some great restaurants)."
4,Spartan Super Weekend,"I Love the W, and when it was awarded to me by Priceline express deals, I was excited. Everything about the hotel screams high society. it can get annoying if you are unaware. Every W feels the same, I have been to at least 2 others across the country. This one was downtown and close to 6th and 4th street. the bar came alive at night and the pool was very relaxing. I will stay here again if its in my price range, but its definitely worth the $$"
5,Breathtaking,We were in town for a wedding in this hotel. I was blown away at the hospitality of this place!! The room was huge and extremely clean! The reception was absolutely perfect! I hope to stay at another W hotel soon! It was well worth the money spent!!
4,Great hotel staff and very clean,"The W Austin staff was some of the best we've come across. From your first interaction with the valet to the last interaction checking out the staff was outstanding.Even though The W isn't the typical vibe we go for we had a great time. The decor gives you the feeling you're in a night club. Don't get me wrong it is beautifully decorated, we just typically go for a different feel. With that being said the rooms were fabulous. Everything was very clean and the rooms were bright and had a lot of natural light. They were spacious and very accommodating. We didn't eat at the restaurant downstairs but it also had great decor and smelled amazing.We did hang out at the pool on Friday night for about the entire day. The pool area was by far my favorite. Great lounge areas and cabanas. Our waitress was very nice as well. The pool is one of the main attractions that would bring us back.The hotel is in a great location. Very close walking distance to about anything you want. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at The W and we'd highly recommend it!"
4,Trendy Zone,"With corridors which wouldnt look out of place on a starship, and cosy rooms with burning fires, the W Austin has to be one of the most trendy hotels in the region. Even though it's in the city centre, the trees and seating area outside the restaurant (TRACE) give breakfast a chilled feeling when the doors are open. Also boasts the most comprehensive minibar I have ever seen (salsa, chips.... CD!) and the rooms are stylish yet practical for business travelers with ample power bars and phone charging station. Good zone to relax....."
5,"Perfect ""MiniMoon""","My husband & I spent our Minimoon (before our full honeymoon) at the W Atx & had a great time. We spent the afternoon at Wet deck pool on a Sunday. Music/DJ was great. Had a few drinks in the evening at the downstairs bar, loved the vibe. The room was awesome, very comfortable. The bellman was super nice, I think William...maybe I'm off on his name but he had strawberries and champagne sent up for us since we were on honeymoon. A perfect visit!"
